0,"NEON, Inc. is awarded a grant to finalize the cyberinfrastructure component of the final design for the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). NEON is a continental research platform that will extend our understanding of the biosphere to regional and continental scales. NEON will be a ?shared-use? research platform of field deployed instrumented towers and sensor arrays, sentinel measurements, remote sensing capabilities, natural history archives, and facilities for data analysis, modeling, visualization, and forecasting, all networked onto a cyberinfrastructure backbone.  Activities supported under this request are to (1) produce a detailed design as part of the requirements to establish readiness for construction of the NEON facility and (2) test and validate the design components with field implementations of sensors and cyberinfrastructure prototypes. The proposed work will define the parameters required to assure accurate and precise measurements with the goal of gaining a complete, clear, thorough and well-documented understanding of the science requirements as the foundation for developing a comprehensive description of the needs for the CI and operational support architectures. The project will seek to identify and address potential critical issues well before construction to minimize the costs in time and materials associated with any necessity of changing the design during or after the commencement of implementation or operations. The complexity of the relationships between data products, measurements, sensors, and the flow-down from Grand Challenge questions to research requirements will be documented with sophisticated analysis and a high degree of collaboration with NEON scientific staff, the CI team, operations staff as well as external scientific, engineering collaborators and equipment and software vendors.",NSF,4900,"NATIONAL ECOLOGICAL OBSERVATORY NETWORK, INC.",1685 38th St.,Boulder,US,Boulder,CO02,"National Ecological Observatory Network, Inc",CO,803012312,47.074,['Marshall R Peterson III'],05/22/2008,785326286,,10/31/2010,4900,NAT ECOLOGICAL OBSERVATORY NET,4553150,0808232,,David S Schimel,1685 38th St.,Boulder,US,Boulder,CO02,"National Ecological Observatory Network, Inc",CO,803012312,dschimel@neoninc.org,David,Schimel,S,7207464849,eblood@nsf.gov,Elizabeth R.

Formulate a comprehensive cyber infrastructure architecture 
Develop a detailed construction ready design
Finalize the detailed construction WBS
Create a project plan for construction, implementation and operational phases 


In the 2 years and 5 months that the project was active, the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) computing staff, which grew from 1 to 8 engineers and administrators, conducted numerous interviews and meetings with staff scientists in order to elicit and understand the requirements that would be imposed on the Cyber Infrastructure (CI). Based on careful analysis of these requirements, the computing staff developed a cyber infrastructure architecture that embodies the following key architectural principles of Extensibility, Manageability, and Reliability. These architectural principles were extracted from the scientific data collection and curation requirements based on the long temporal (30 yrs)and geographical (continental) extents within which the Cyber infrastructure is expected to function.  The architecture that the NEON computing staff developed to achieve these ""ilities"" is a highly modular architecture whose components or subsystems interact indirectly via messages sent and delivered over an Enterprise Service Bus.  Further, the architecture was resolved into a detailed component design that was implemented and thoroughly tested on a prototype, scaled down cyber infrastructure utilizing all Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) hardware, and approximately 70% COTS and Open Source software.  The architecture and design were technically reviewed in a number of design reviews, culminating in the NSF sponsored Final Design Review (FDR). The architecture was also   documented in a cyber infrastructure architecture document.

The computing staff also performed a bottom up analysis of the work required to construct a full blown cyber infrastructure and generated a detailed construction Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) which was integrated into the NEON Construction WBS and presented at and passed an NSF sponsored Final Design Review (FDR). In addition, the NEON computing staff created a complete set of project plans for the construction, implementation, and operation of the cyber infrastructures. These project plans included a Management Plan, a Software Development Plan, a Software Reuse Plan, a Security Plan, a Software Configuration Management Plan, and a Software Metrics Plan.

The cyber infrastructure that has been designed and prototyped as a result of this Cooperative Agreement (CA) will, when fully implemented during construction, will be an integrating force not only for NEON but for the ecological community as whole. The CI will be the central collection, curation, and dissemination resource that promises to provide the community extensive, varied, and comprehensive data that can be used for transformational ecological forecasting capability. It will be an enabler and facilitator of transformative ecological science which promises to provide an early warning system for ecological impacts of climate change, invasive species, and emerging diseases. The cyber infrastructure will also be instrumental in facilitating the education of the next generation of scientists in the ecological and related fields.

Title: CT-CS: Trustworthy Cyber Infrastructure for the Power Grid

PI: William H. Sanders

Today's quality of life depends on the continuous functioning of the nation's electric power infrastructure, which depends in turn on the health of an underlying computing and communication network infrastructure that is at serious risk both from malicious cyber attacks and accidental failures. This Cyber Trust center-scale activity addresses the challenge of how to design, build, and validate a cyber infrastructure for the next generation power grid that can survive malicious cyber attacks while providing continuous power delivery.  Since the constraints and vulnerabilities of the power system cyber infrastructure are similar to those faced by many other critical infrastructure systems, the solutions created are expected to be adaptable for use in those systems as well.  The activity will thus have a significant impact on the way the cyber infrastructure of the future power grid and other critical infrastructures are built, making them more secure, reliable, and safe.

More specifically, this research creates infrastructure technology that will convey critical information to grid system operators despite partially successful cyber attacks and accidental failures. Security and trust validation techniques are developed that can quantify the trustworthiness of a proposed design with respect to critical properties.  The activity's educational program provides an integrated undergraduate and graduate experience for students of Cyber Trust issues, including working on cross-disciplinary teams and understanding practical concerns of industry. An interactive simulator created by the project will allow users to experiment with new power grid cyber-infrastructure design approaches.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS,1901 South First Street,Champaign,US,Champaign,IL13,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,IL,618207406,47.070,"['Roy H Campbell', 'Peter W Sauer', 'Ravishankar  Iyer', 'David M Nicol']",08/16/2005,041544081,,07/31/2010,4900,CYBER TRUST,7227125,0524695,041544081,William H Sanders,1901 South First Street,Champaign,US,Champaign,IL13,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,IL,618207406,whs@uiuc.edu,William,Sanders,H,2173330345,clandweh@nsf.gov,carl landwehr,7032920000,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,"['Pattabiraman, K;Saggese, GP;Chen, D;Kalbarczyk, Z;Iyer, RK~Dynamic derivation of application-specific error detectors and their implementation in hardware~6th European Dependable Computing Conference~ ~2006~~97~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=169508230#000243328000015', 'Wang, L;Kalbarczyk, Z;Gu, WN;Iyer, RK~An OS-level framework for providing application-aware reliability~12th Pacific Rim International Symposium on Dependable Computing~ ~2006~~55~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=169702623#000244479700007', 'Pattabiraman, K;Kalbarczyk, Z;Iyer, RK~Automated derivation of application-aware error detectors using static analysis~13th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium~ ~2007~~211~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=170169938#000248534400042', 'Hasan, R;Winslett, M~Synergy: A policy-driven, trust-aware information dissemination framework~IEEE InternationalConference on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI 2006)~3975~2006~~516~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=151139029#000238207800050', 'Lee, AJ;Winslett, M;Basney, J;Welch, V~Traust: A trust negotiation based authorization service~4th International Conference on Trust Management~3986~2006~~458~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=151204129#000238108800036', 'Lee, AJ;Winslett, M~Virtual fingerprinting as a foundation for reputation in open systems~4th International Conference on Trust Management~3986~2006~~236~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=151203946#000238108800018', 'Nicol, DM;Liljenstam, M;Liu, J~Advanced concepts in large-scale network simulation~2005 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC 05)~ ~2005~~153~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=169082020#000236253400015', 'Nicol, DM;Liljenstam, M~Models and analysis of active worm defense~3rd International Workshop on Mathematical Methods, Models, and Architectures for Computer Network Security~3685~2005~~38~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=147796339#000233596000004', 'Tsang, PP;Au, MH;Kapadia, A;Smith, SW~Blacklistable Anonymous Credentials: Blocking Misbehaving Users without TTPs~14th ACM Conference on Computer and Communication Security~ ~2007~~72~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=171141594#000266205800007', 'Johnson, PC;Kapadia, A;Tsang, PP;Smith, SW~Nymble: Anonymous IP-Address blocking~7th International Symposium on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PET 2007)~4776~2007~~113~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=170569970#000251390900008', 'Myagmar, S;Campbell, R;Winslett, M~Security challenges of reconfigurable devices in the power grid~1st Annual IFIP International Conference on Critical Infrastructure Protection~253~2008~~147~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=170708106#000252198100011', 'Lee, AJ;Minami, K;Winslett, M~Lightweight Consistency Enforcement Schemes for Distributed Proofs with Hidden Subtrees~12th ACM Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies (SACMAT 2007)~ ~2007~~101~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=180638746#000266108500011', 'Lee, AJ;Winslett, M~Enforcing Safety and Consistency Constraints in Policy-Based Authorization Systems~13th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Sec~12~2008~~ ~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=176113594#000263100000002', 'Ahsant, M;Basney, J;Mulmo, O;Lee, AJ;Johnsson, L~Toward an on-demand restricted delegation mechanism for Grids~7th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Grid Computing~ ~2006~~152~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=169711793#000245376900020', 'Kirti, S;Scaglione, A;Thomas, RJ~A scalable wireless communication architecture for average consensus~46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control~ ~2007~~5218~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=171183654#000255181703028', 'Davis, CM;Tate, JE;Okhravi, H;Grier, C;Overbye, TJ;Nicol, D~SCADA cyber security testbed development~38th Annual North American Power Symposium (NAPS)~ ~2006~~483~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=169930810#000246829900066', 'Nicol, DM;Tsang, R;Ammerlahn, H;Johnson, M~Detection of nuclear material at border crossings using motion correlation~2006 Winter Simulation Conference~ ~2006~~536~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=170112622#000246261201012', 'Nicol, DM;Tsang, R;Ammerlahn, H;Johnson, MM~Sensor fusion algorithms for the detection of nuclear material at border crossings -

2,"Cyber-infrastructure refers to the ability to access and integrate today's hardware, software, and human information technology resources in order to facilitate science, engineering, research and education goals.    In the next five years, the challenge for Cyber-infrastructure will be socio-cultural and behavioral dynamics, economics, and policy.   The objective of this award is to hold a hold a workshop that will seek to identify for the SBE and CISE Directorates at NSF the key problems in the social sciences, economics, organizational, and policy studies for Cyber-infrastructure.  The goal of the workshop will be to stimulate discussion within and between the communities served by the SBE and CISE Directorates about Cyber-infrastructure and to produce a report that outlines some of the key challenges and areas for fruitful research, development and experimentation by SBE and CISE.   Specific goals for the workshop are
1) To produce a report which lays out a Cyber-infrastructure research and development roadmap for the SBE and CISE community and provide a framework for projects and efforts going forward;
2) To provide a venue for community building within the SBE and IT communities;
3) To lay out a program for research on the effects of IT on society and the 
dynamics of IT-focused organizations and the cyber-culture

Broader Impacts:
SBE plays a key role in the development of Cyber-infrastructure.   Not only is data and computational Cyber-infrastructure an enabler for key efforts for SBE communities, but SBE can play a critical role in the design, development and culture surrounding the deployment of Cyber-infrastructure itself.   A strategic approach to the development of a body of research, development, and experimentation that addresses the socio-cultural, economic, and policy challenges of Cyber-infrastructure will be critical to ensure its success. In particular, social and behavioral scientists, humanists, organizational, policy and management researchers, etc. are critical as process builders for Cyber-infrastructure as well as end users of Cyber-infrastructure. Such communities have only sporadically been engaged in the development of Cyber-infrastructure models, social and organizational structures and have a wealth of experience and context to offer.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",Office of Contract & Grant Admin,La Jolla,US,La Jolla,CA49,University of California-San Diego,CA,920930934,47.075,['Ruzena K Bajcsy'],11/04/2004,804355790,120000,10/31/2005,4900,ECONOMICS,120000,0451212,071549000,Francine D Berman,Office of Contract & Grant Admin,La Jolla,US,La Jolla,CA49,University of California-San Diego,CA,920930934,berman@sdsc.edu,Francine,Berman,D,8585346195,@nsf.gov,,,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,,11/01/2004,"Social, Cultural, Economic and Policy Challenges for Cyberinfrastructure Workshop; Dec. 1-3, 2004; Washington, DC",Grant
3,"The proliferation of digital data provides new opportunities in all areas of science, engineering and industry. However, the increasing data volumes and rates, and the associated costs in terms of latencies and energy, quickly dominate and limit data analytics applications' ability to leverage this data in an effective and timely manner. The co-design process enables scientists to reason about the rich design spaces available in software and hardware, and is expected to help in constructing a new class of cyber-infrastructure. Nevertheless, current solutions for big data analytics have important limitations that make these solutions infeasible for the next generation of cyber-infrastructure. As a result, exploring key co-design issues in the scope of big data analytics has become critical.

The overarching goals of this research are to understand the performance and power behaviors and tradeoffs related to data placement, movement, and processing of big data analytics on systems with emerging architectures, and to develop models that can fundamentally enable big data analytics on ongoing cyber-infrastructure. In contrast to existing work, this research effort focuses on the co-design process that has been exploited in the context of large-scale scientific applications. Key research activities include building a framework to evaluate different classes of big data analytics, characterizing data analytics applications in terms of performance and power, and developing a methodology to construct models to understand and explore the design space.

As data analytics applications become increasingly important in a wide range of domains, the ability to develop large-scale and sustainable platforms and software infrastructure to support these applications has significant potential to drive research and innovation in science and business domains. This project provides an understanding of hardware/software characteristics and requirements for big data analytics and future cyber-infrastructure design.

First, we studied different architectural designs and processing frameworks for different classes of relevant applications under different constrains. We aimed at providing the foundations to develop models that can enable Big Data analytics on next generation cyber-infrastructure based on software-defined infrastructure. We specifically targeted two of the main distributed processing systems for Big Data analytics: Apache Hadoop and Spark, using different storage technologies (i.e., from hard disk to current non-volatile memory solutions). The experimental evaluation delivered a comprehensive characterization of performance and energy/power behaviors and tradeoffs of Hadoop and Spark; provided insights on using power capping techniques in Spark deployments for operating under power constraints while meeting performance goals; identified a number of factors that play an important role in Hadoop and Spark?s performance, power, and energy efficiency; and explored for first time the potential of software-defined infrastructure for Big Data processing frameworks in terms of execution time, energy and cost. This effort not only characterized different big data processing system but also took into account the impact of the operating system, different flavors of virtualization and the programming language to performance and energy/power related metrics. It provided a better understanding of virtualization mechanisms to improve resource utilization and quantified overheads that are useful to the targeted models for optimizing design choices and policies that can optimize energy consumption and meeting power budgets.

Further, we investigated behaviors and limitations of current in-memory frameworks, thus leading to insights regarding design choices toward next-generation software-defined in-memory frameworks. Our empirical experimental evaluation focused on persistence methods for Spark and the use of Alluxio. It provided meaningful data points to better understand requirements and design choices for next-generation software-defined infrastructure and explored the use of disaggregated off-rack memory and NVMe via simulation. The obtained results indicated that software-defined infrastructure can be a viable solution for provisioning bare metal disaggregated datacenter resources and provided meaningful data points to illuminate the requirements of in-memory systems to efficiently scale next-generation software-defined infrastructure implementations. While this work represents the foundation or a segment in the most ambitious path towards software-defined in-memory frameworks, the insights obtained from this work were critical for future efforts on caching systems for combining Spark and Alluxio efficiently. We complemented these efforts investigating in-memory analytics and tradeoffs in the context of data intensive scientific workflows using RDMA-based abstractions, cyber-security, and data streaming for IoT environments and scientific cyber-infrastructure.

Finally, we investigated tradeoffs between power, performance, and quality in the context of high performance computing for building a new task scheduling model considering AMR properties for managing power budgets at scale. To understand the applicability of the proposed approach, we studied the mechanisms and policies that control AMR properties and then characterized AMR properties in terms of performance, power consumption, and system impact for a representative set of AMR-based applications. We also studied the potential of power capping techniques for re-distributing the power budget to other components of a workflow by trading-off power and quality metrics. The experiments revealed that tradeoff strategies can create an available power budget to enhance system reliability with minimum resolution degradation.

Eleven (11) scientific publications resulting from this effort have been published in major international workshops, conferences, and journals. This project has provided research and educational opportunities for students and researchers and has contributed to their academic work. It has also provided them the opportunity to collaborate with other researchers in academia and industry, to present their work at conferences and other meetings, to work with state of the art technologies, and to participate in software development and acquire related skills.

This award provides continuing support for the skilled personnel who will continue to support and maintain the LDG and deliver the substantial improvements in services, scalability and reliability needed by Advanced LIGO. The primary goals of this proposal are: to allow the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) to complete the analysis of Initial LIGO observations; to deliver the software infrastructure and LDG services to support gravitational-wave astronomy with Advanced LIGO and its international partners; to provide the cyber-infrastructure needed to bring gravitational-wave astronomy together with the broader astronomical community; and to prototype tools for open access to LIGO data for the scientific community and the public.

Gravitational waves and black holes are among the most dramatic predictions of Einstein's General theory of Relativity. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) is an ambitious NSF-funded project designed to directly detect gravitational waves and to use these waves to explore the universe. LIGO forms part of a world-wide network of gravitational-wave observatories poised to probe black holes, neutron stars, supernovae and the early universe using gravitational-waves as a new astronomical tool. The Advanced LIGO detectors are currently under construction and will begin their first observations in approximately 2015. The first direct detection of gravitational waves will be a watershed event in 21st century physics and astronomy. The scientific goals of the LSC rely on a substantial computational infrastructure, which spans astrophysical data analysis, detector and analysis middleware, software sustainability and computational hardware support. Initial LIGO has shown that cyber-infrastructure is as essential to gravitational-wave astronomy as the detectors themselves. It will not be possible to detect gravitational-wave sources, to study their properties, and to maximize the NSF's investment in LIGO without support for the enabling computational technologies. This award to develop and sustain Advanced LIGO's cyber-infrastructure will allow the LIGO Scientific Collaboration to be ready for the transformative new science that gravitational-wave observations will bring.  The LDG research program will train students and postdocs to be experts in next-generation cyber-infrastructure, push the boundaries of LIGO's geographically distributed, locally-available computational data grid, and sustain the operation of this cyber-infrastructure to support LIGO's science mission.

The LIGO Data Grid (LDG) is a distributed computational facility that hosts the software platforms and personnel needed to turn a collection of computer clusters into a powerful data analysis engine for gravitational-wave science. This award provided support for talented personnel to maintain the LDG and deliver the services, scalability and reliability needed by Advanced LIGO. The LDG team thus enabled gravitational-wave astronomy with Advanced LIGO and its international partners during the first two observing runs in 2015-2016 and 2016-2017. This award also supported the development of a platform (GraCEDb) to communicate between gravitational-wave astronomers and partners with electromagnetic telescopes and particle detectors.
On September 14, 2015, gravitational waves generated by the collision of two black holes passed the Earth. The Advanced LIGO detectors in Hanford, Washington and Livingston, Louisiana both registered the waves as they passed. Data recorded by these instruments was automatically transferred to Caltech, and on to Albert Einstein Institute, where it was analyzed. Just 3 minutes after the waves passed, the results were uploaded to GraCEDb and scientists across the Collaboration were alerted to the first direct measurement of gravitational waves. It took many months of analysis to confirm this first detection, to understand the properties of the black holes that collided, and to investigate the implications. This event is now known as GW150914. The likely direction to GW150914 was also communicated to partners via GraCEDb; while black-hole collisions are not likely to generate bright explosions, partners did look for light and particles coming from the collision. The tools and services developed, deployed and operated by this award were essential to the rapid identification of the signal and the subsequent analysis: they allowed the Collaboration to efficiently and robustly use computing facilities distributed around the world to understand the instrumental data and the gravitational-wave signal. This was a landmark discovery providing direct evidence of the gravitational waves and black holes predicted by Einstein?s theory. The collaboration published 11 papers about the event in February 2016 and made gravitational-wave observations part of the astronomer?s toolbox.
Even as the deep analyses of the September 14, 2015 event was going on. The LIGO detectors continued to acquire more data which was being analyzed within minutes of acquisition with the help of the LDG infrastructure and the LDG team. On 26 December 2015, a second measurable gravitational-wave signal passed Earth. This time the Collaboration was alerted just a minute after the wave passed. This signal, known as GW151226, also came from colliding black holes. Many more signals from colliding black holes have been identified since that time and searches for a vast array of signals from other types of astrophysical sources have also been completed using software and services provided under this award.  
Then, on 17 August 2017, the first gravitational wave from a binary neutron star collision, GW170817, was identified within 7 minutes of the waves passing Earth. An automated coincidence analysis confirmed that GW170817 was associated with the gamma-ray burst GRB170817a. GraCEDb provided all the information needed by astronomers to locate an optical counterpart of GW170817 within 10 hours. Observations from gamma-ray through radio were all reported in GraCEDb. GW170817 confirmed that neutron star mergers are the progenitors of some gamma-ray bursts, showed that gravitational waves travel at the same speed as light, provided an independent measurement of the expansion of our universe, ruled out physical theories that try to explain away dark matter as modified gravity, and provided a plausible mechanism to produce all or most of the gold and platinum found on Earth.
The first direct detection of gravitational waves was a watershed event in 21st century physics and astronomy. The scientific goals of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration rely on a substantial computational infrastructure, which spans astrophysical data analysis, detector and analysis platforms, software sustainability and computational hardware support. Cyber-infrastructure is as essential to gravitational-wave astronomy as the detectors themselves. This award provided cyber-infrastructure that allowed the LIGO Scientific Collaboration to carry out the transformative science that gravitational-wave observations bring.
In addition, we trained young scientisits to be experts in next-generation cyber-infrastructure, pushed the boundaries of LIGO's geographically distributed computational data grid, and sustained the operation of this cyber-infrastructure to support LIGO's science mission. Collaborations with external partners (including Internet2, Globus, Condor and Pegasus) continued to have significant impact outside the LSC.

5,"Strategic decision-making for physical-world infrastructures is rapidly transitioning toward a pervasively cyber-enabled paradigm, in which human stakeholders and automation leverage the cyber-infrastructure at large (including on-line data sources, cloud computing, and handheld devices).  This changing paradigm is leading to tight coupling of the cyber- infrastructure with multiple physical- world infrastructures, including air transportation and electric power systems.  These management-coupled cyber- and physical- infrastructures (MCCPIs) are subject to complex threats from natural and sentient adversaries, which can enact complex propagative impacts across networked physical-, cyber-, and human elements.  

We propose here to develop a modeling framework and tool suite for threat assessment for MCCPIs.  The proposed modeling framework for MCCPIs has three aspects: 1) a tractable moment-linear modeling paradigm for the hybrid, stochastic, and multi-layer dynamics of MCCPIs; 2) models for sentient and natural adversaries, that capture their measurement and actuation capabilities in the cyber- and physical- worlds, intelligence, and trust-level; and 3) formal definitions for information security and vulnerability. The attendant tool suite will provide situational awareness of the propagative impacts of threats. Specifically, three functionalities termed Target, Feature, and Defend will be developed, which exploit topological characteristics of an MCCPI to evaluate and mitigate threat impacts. We will then pursue analyses that tie special infrastructure-network features to security/vulnerability.  As a central case study, the framework and tools will be used for threat assessment and risk analysis of strategic air traffic management.  Three canonical types of threats will be addressed: environmental-to-physical threats, cyber-physical co-threats, and human-in-the-loop threats. This case study will include development and deployment of software decision aids for managing man-made disturbances to the air traffic system.",NSF,4900,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,280 Lighty,PULLMAN,US,Pullman,WA05,Washington State University,WA,991641060,47.070,"['Ali  Mehrizi-Sani', 'Hans  Van Dongen', 'Adam  Hahn']",09/16/2015,041485301,489999,08/31/2019,4900,CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (CPS),489999,1545104,041485301,Sandip  Roy,P.

6,"Strategic decision-making for physical-world infrastructures is rapidly transitioning toward a pervasively cyber-enabled paradigm, in which human stakeholders and automation leverage the cyber-infrastructure at large (including on-line data sources, cloud computing, and handheld devices).  This changing paradigm is leading to tight coupling of the cyber- infrastructure with multiple physical- world infrastructures, including air transportation and electric power systems.  These management-coupled cyber- and physical- infrastructures (MCCPIs) are subject to complex threats from natural and sentient adversaries, which can enact complex propagative impacts across networked physical-, cyber-, and human elements.  

We propose here to develop a modeling framework and tool suite for threat assessment for MCCPIs.  The proposed modeling framework for MCCPIs has three aspects: 1) a tractable moment-linear modeling paradigm for the hybrid, stochastic, and multi-layer dynamics of MCCPIs; 2) models for sentient and natural adversaries, that capture their measurement and actuation capabilities in the cyber- and physical- worlds, intelligence, and trust-level; and 3) formal definitions for information security and vulnerability. The attendant tool suite will provide situational awareness of the propagative impacts of threats. Specifically, three functionalities termed Target, Feature, and Defend will be developed, which exploit topological characteristics of an MCCPI to evaluate and mitigate threat impacts. We will then pursue analyses that tie special infrastructure-network features to security/vulnerability.  As a central case study, the framework and tools will be used for threat assessment and risk analysis of strategic air traffic management.

7,"The scale and complexity of the smart grid, along with its increased connectivity and automation, make the task of cyber protection particularly challenging. Recently, smart grid researchers and standards bodies have developed technological requirements and potential solutions for protecting cyber infrastructure. However, grid protection remains daunting to asset owners because of resources limitations. Important questions arise when identifying priorities for design and protection: Which cyber components, if compromised, can lead to significant power delivery disruption? What grid topologies are inherently robust to classes of cyber attack? Is the additional information available through advanced cyber infrastructure worth the increased security risk? The goal of this proposal is to study a graph-theoretic dynamical systems approach for modeling the interactions between the cyber and the electricity networks of the smart grid to identify non-cookie-cutter vulnerabilities, the relative physical impact of cyber attacks, and cost-benefit trade offs for potential countermeasures. The electrical network is modeled as a graph where vertices represent distributed generators, intelligent electronic devices, and loads or plug-in hybrids; edges denote physical and operative coupling amongst the respective vertices. Similarly the sensing and communication (cyber) network is depicted as a graph expressing logical and functional interactions for sensing, actuation and cyber attack and mitigation mechanisms. The graphs induce a dynamical systems description of the smart grid conveniently allowing for the coupling of cyber and electrical graphs through dynamical state modeling of the cyber-physical bridge. The degree of modeling abstraction is granular (depending on how the graph vertices are defined) allowing for both extensive and more streamlined assessment subject to available time and computation. The goal of the paradigm is not to produce an exact result of a given cyber attack, but to illustrate possible outcomes and complex interrelationships amongst grid components. We will evaluate the potential of our framework in realistically modeling complex behaviors, in part, through comparison with power system simulations.

Intellectual Merit: The overall outcome is a mathematical tool that can be used to design inherently secure smart grid topologies and prioritize security mitigation approaches. The well matched expertise of the team provides a unique opportunity to integrate information security and power system stability concepts to produce a timely and well-suited smart grid security impact analysis approach. The proposed research is the first to seek a formalized analysis methodology with the potential to yield both analytic and empirical results for the assessment of cyber attacks and mitigation strategies on the smart grid. Tighter mathematical modeling of the cyber and electrical processes has the potential to shed greater light on topological design strategies for building a more secure smart grid. Furthermore, the graph-based paradigm facilitates visual representation of results effective in conveying complex interdependent insights to stakeholders.

Broader Impacts: This project will enable the early deployment and long-term adoption of secure smart grid technologies, revolutionizing the electricity marketplace while facilitating a smaller ecological footprint. The results of this work will have timely and fundamental implications to power system upgrade and future design that will be disseminated to undergraduate students, high school teachers, researchers, government bodies and industry alike. Education in cyber security of advanced power systems is essentially needed to create security professionals who will work to protect the nation's critical infrastructures.

The main goal of this project is to study dynamical systems approaches for modeling the interactions between the cyber and the electricity networks of the smart grid to identify non-cookie-cutter vulnerabilities, the relative physical impact of cyber attacks, and cost-benefit trade-offs for potential countermeasures.

Three dynamical systems smart grid synthesis models have been developed:

We developed cyber-physical system model based on flocking theory to model generator coherence and communication packet routing within smart grid systems.
We developed a distributed control paradigm based on feedback linearization that provides fast response to power system disruptions.
We developed a real-time co-simulator testbed using commercial simulator packages (OPNET, LabVIEW and RTDS) to model cyber attacks and empirically evaluate their impacts on power system components.


All contributions have led to fundamental insights for cyber-physical system modeling, vulnerability analysis of smart grid systems and strategies to enable built-in resilience using both cyber and physical approaches. Results have been both analtyical and empirical in nature involving multidisciplinary perspectives and collaboration.

10,"The NSF's Global Environment for Network Innovation (GENI) embodies a key aspect of next generation Cyber Infrastructure, heterogenity:  it is a diverse set of resources with differing implementations of common interfaces, owned and operated by multiple organizations.  It is an early example of a federated cloud computing infrastructure.   Federated infrastructure and the on-going adoption of networking and information technology that touches on almost every aspect of our society, as activities relating to commerce, government, research, education, health care, critical infrastructure, etc., means that we need a principled and well-grounded understanding of the security properties and security architecture that are deeply integrated with and pervade such infrastructure.  Using GENI as an example, this project is developing a top level sketch of the security issues of a federated infrastructure.

The project has two tasks:  the first is to review, analyze and document entities, operations and relationships among them with security relevance in the GENI Architecture and GENI Software Prototypes;  the second is to analyze the current security capabilities of GENI vis-a-vis current and future requirements likely to be levied against the security architecture.

GENI started as a research, development and prototyping effort by a large collaboration of U.S. research universities, focused on creating a laboratory in which future breakthoughs, going beyond the current Internet, could be prototyped, investigated, and ultimately incubated until market forces lead to broad adoption by industry, commerce, government, and consumers. Over the course of a decade, a sizeable infrastructure including software, racks of computing systems, and network backbones were developed and interconnected. An overall GENI Architecure governs the structure of this system at the highest level.

 The GENI Architecture defines abstractions to enable many experimenters to simultaneously conduct research experiments over various protions of a shared, potentially federated, collection of computing and networking resources.  In our research study, we examined the choices defining and constraining this architecture, from the viewpoint of security, and identified features and capabilities that have future security consequences. In some cases, such as enforcement of resource quotas, initial implementations of security mechanisms suitable for GENI today need to be augmented in future updates to the GENI security architecture for adoption in more powerful and general cyber infrastructures that are envisioned as the next-generation of deployed technology. Core security issues addressed in GENI, such as authorization and the schemes used to define, communicate and enforce access controls and protection checks, provide starting points upon which to base the next generation of security mechanisms. 

Many issues first addressed in GENI, such as RSpecs, the manner for describing, advertising, and requesting widely varying and tailored experimental resources, equivalent to sophisticated cloud computing and network communication resources and services, require further exploration. These research investigations, regarding security threats, properties and mechanisms, will ultimately provide architectural guidance for prototyping and deploying  future secure incarnations of federated, experimental cyber infrastructure. Experience and hands-on use of software technologies developed in such cyber infrastructure will ultimately inform commercial decisions regarding development and deployment of networks and cyber infrastructure that pervades the modern economy throughout the United States and the rest of the world.

11,"This workshop will inaugurate a National Forum for Geosciences Information Technology (FGIT). FGIT will be a focal point for a national dialog on technology across all of the geosciences to address cyber-infrastructure issues and challenges through an exchange of ideas, experiences, and requirements. It will foster the leveraging of lessons learned in development efforts in different areas of the geosciences and foster the development of best practices for cyber-infrastructure deployment and use. Participants will include people involved in the development and operation of geosciences cyber-infrastructure, current and potential users of such cyber-infrastructure, and other interested parties. The theme of the workshop will be, ""Advancing the Development, Coordination, Deployment and Use of Information Technologies for Enabling Research, Education, and Operations in the Geosciences"". It will include presentations and discussions that include academic, federal agency, and corporate perspectives, on key advances in cyber-infrastructure that can benefit the geosciences, and on topics that cut across the geoscience and environmental research communities. Attendees will be active participants in the meeting, bringing forward their interests and expertise in discussion groups through the use of a modern interactive meeting technique. FGIT will complement other national and international meetings that have more disciplinary or developmentally focused cyber-infrastructure agendas. 

FGIT is expected to contribute to an increase in awareness of the potential of information technology among the geoscience workforce and to more effective planning of cyber-infrastructure development in the geosciences. These in turn will contribute to enhancing research in the geosciences, improving education, and informing public decision-making. As part of this project, FGIT will maintain a public web site that will be devoted to framing important issues for discussion, hosting presentation and other information from FGIT meetings, such as white papers, hosting working group reports, and bulletin and message boards for the exchange of information on hot topics in cyber-infrastructure.

The project, therefore, has three goals: (1) to characterize cyber-enabled learning using a case study; (2) to identify the assessment and psychometric issues related to assessing cyber-enabled learning; and (3) to propose methodological solutions to modeling learning in such complex learning environments. The focus of the stduy is on a substantial case study in geoscience, which employs science content that is accessible to a wide range of the education community, and which draws on known areas of research, particularly scientific visualization: the study of earthquakes, tsunamis, and related phenomena. 

This project asks: What is the character of analytical reasoning for geoscience within a networked, cyber-infrastructure framework, and what counts as evidence for such reasoning? What assessment and psychometric issues must be addressed? What are the methodological challenges in modeling and assessing learning within this cyber-infrastructure project? For example, how are claims of causality handled in a complex networked and nested learning environment, and what evidence would make such claims credible?

13,"Cyber attacks, especially those involving Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), have targeted organizations of all types, including higher education institutions.  A key opportunity to counter large-scale cyber attacks is to initiate the establishment of a broad partnership regarding the ultimate goal of cross-organization protected sharing of relevant cyber security data for enhanced operation, workforce development, and research. The impacts of sharing cyber security data are immense.  Due to the risks of monoculture in enterprise computing, the ""one plus one is greater than two"" effects have already been widely recognized in the cyber security community.  They can enhance collaborative cyber security operations through cross-organization sharing of relevant cybersecurity data.  They can also empower researchers to develop scalable data analytics and tools for more effective prevention, mitigation, and response to cross-organization cyber attacks. Finally, they can significantly enhance the education and learning of diverse cyber security workforce (including developers, analysts, and managers).  A key challenge for sharing cyber security data is an institution's concern about potential risks involved in sharing such data.  Due to the complexity of the problems, solutions to tackle this challenge can only emerge from meetings and forums that include all stake holders such that their potential concerns about sharing cyber security data can be addressed together. Furthermore, thought leaders in cyber security, big data analytics, cyber infrastructure, privacy, data sharing policy and compliance can all contribute to such discussions in a unique way.  Therefore, this project will organize a series of planning activities (including a workshop) regarding Cross-organization Sharing of Cyber Security Data, in collaboration with the Northeast Big Data Hub, Penn State, Rutgers University, Dartmouth College, industry partners (e.g., IBM), and government partners (e.g., Army Research Lab).  The workshop will generate a report regarding best practices (including draft agreements and related infrastructures), planning for workforce development, and path to financial sustainability for three academic institutions in Northeast region (i.e., the Pennsylvania State University, Rutgers University, and Dartmouth College) to enable and leverage cross-organization sharing of massive cyber security data.

This project will improve our understanding about the complex issues related to barriers for protected sharing of cyber security data.  An improved understanding regarding these issues and their relationships in a holistic way provides a critical base on which possible best practices for agreements, frameworks, and cyber infrastructures for sharing relevant cyber security data can be established.   In addition, the workshop will also identify options and uncover their tradeoffs for addressing the complex issues for cross-organization sharing of cyber security data.  It is likely that these tacit knowledge, once articulated clearly through the workshop report, will enhance the formal knowledge regarding cyber security analysis, management, and tool development, especially for achieving cross-organization big data cyber attack awareness.  This project will also generate three broad impacts: (i)  it will fundamentally transform cyber defense operations by enabling multi-organization collaborative defense; (ii)  it will enhance the global competitiveness of diverse cyber security workforce through enhancements to training tools, learning modules, and courses that leverage real-world cyber security data; (iii) it will foster research regarding cross-organization cyber situation awareness through innovative analytics of massive cross-organization cyber security data.

Intellectual Merit Outcomes

- Developed a hybrid computational representation of cyber attack patterns, leveraging both declaration representation and procedural representation techniques developed in AI, that enable linking the dependency between different attack steps, while, in the same time, allowing multiple hypotheses about the details of these steps to co-exist.  The attack patterns representation is a hierarchical knowledge structure that includes computational representation of Tactics, Technique, and Procedures (TTP) of cyber attack patterns.

- Developed a novel incident response generation algorithm that automatically generates combinations of responses that can disrupt or limit the options of future steps of attackers based on detected cyber attack patterns.

- Developed a novel pattern-driven data queries so that an attack pattern that matches one ore more Indicators of Compromises (IoC's) can be used to collect additional relevant information (e.g., from log data) to further narrow down hypotheses about certain specifics of the attack (e.g., credentials stolen by the attacker), which can benefit the generation of suitable responses.

- A provisional US patent entitled ""Systems and Methods for Automated Processing of Cyber Attack Patterns for Cyber Defense"" (inventors: Donald Welch, John Yen, Peng Liu, Mike Petkac, and Ben Hanrahan) has been filed by Penn State University in September 2017.

 

Broader Impacts Outcome

- Held a multi-institution workshop in November 2016 regarding the sharing of cyber attack related big data.  The participants of the workshop include representatives from a broad range of stake holders who are involved in establishing institution-level agreements for four academic institutions: Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), intrusion detection/protection analysts, incident response analysts, Risk Management Office, General Counsel Office, etc.  Participants also include representatives from industry partners and government agencies.  The panel discussions of the workshop focus on potential benefits and potential obstacles for sharing cyber attack related big data.  These discussions highlighted the importance of two critical requirements for multi-institution sharing of cyber attack patterns.  First, the sharing of such sensitive data requires a deep level of trust between the institutions, the CISO's, and the analysts.  Second, the value-added proposition for the information shared is critical. 

- Based on the feedback of the workshop, sharing of cyber attack patterns among trusted institution is identified as a highly desirable big data multi-institution sharing activities for enhanced situation awareness about cyber attacks.

14,"As society becomes more dependent on cyber infrastructure, the security of networks and information technologies has become a growing concern. Individuals, businesses, and governmental organizations are now common victims of cyber-attacks that seek to steal private data, gain remote control over remote systems, and cause harm to networks and systems through other malicious means. Additionally, critical infrastructures such as smart power grids and communication networks are facing an increasing number of cyber-based threats. As a result, many researchers and security practitioners have begun to investigate cyber attacker communities in order to learn more about cyber attacker behaviors, emerging threats, and the cybercriminal supply chain. Unfortunately, there is a lack of established science for cyber security research. The lack of literature is problematic for researchers wanting to learn more so that they may contribute to and advance the current state of cyber security research. For example, many cyber attacker communities take careful measures to hide themselves by employing anti-crawling measures. This would be a challenge for many researchers and security practitioners. Furthermore, some may find cyber attacker community discussion difficult to interpret due to cyber attacker jargon, advanced security concepts, or foreign contents belonging to cyber attacker groups spanning across different countries or regions.

For these reasons, research studying hacker communities is greatly needed, as well as research that advances others? capacity to understand and investigate contents from such communities. Specifically, the development of automated tools and analyses increases the potential for more cyber security research. Web mining and machine learning technologies can be used in tandem with social science methodologies to help answer many questions related to hacker behaviors and culture, illegal markets and covert networks, cybercriminal supply chain, malware analysis, emerging security threats, and other matters. There are many opportunities for extending current cyber security research by combining hacker community data with social science methodologies, computational techniques, and security analysis. 
   
In this research, important questions about hacker behaviors, markets, community structure, community contents, artifacts, and cultural differences are explored. Automated techniques to collect and analyze data from forums, Internet Relay Chat, and honeypots will be developed. The development of such tools will help further proactive approaches for preventing cyber-based threats, rather than taking the traditional approach of reacting when something ""bad"" happens.  Better understanding of hacker communities across multiple geopolitical regions will support a better understanding of cybercriminal behavior, and improved and safer practices for security researchers and practitioners.

The proposed integrated computational framework and the resulting algorithms and software will also allow social science researchers and security practitioners to closely examine how cyber attacker groups form, develop, and spread their ideas; identify important and influential cyber criminals in the online world; and develop the means to recognize online hacker identities through their communication and interaction styles. Knowing more about cyber criminals, hackers, and their illegal black markets can help policy makers and security professionals make better decisions about how to prevent or respond to attacks. 

The proposed work also contributes to the educational and professional development of the student research associates who contribute to it.  They will learn sound research methods, and how to write about and present their work for scientific and other professional audiences.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,888 N Euclid Ave,Tucson,US,Tucson,AZ03,University of Arizona,AZ,857194824,47.075,"['Ronald L Breiger', 'Salim  Hariri', 'Thomas J Holt']",08/29/2013,806345617,1190722,08/31/2018,4900,Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace,1301944,1314631,072459266,Hsinchun  Chen,1130 East Helen Street,Tucson,US,Tucson,AZ03,University of Arizona Artificial Intelligence Lab,AZ,857210108,hchen@eller.arizona.edu,Hsinchun,Chen,,5206214153,skiesler@nsf.gov,Sara Kiesler,7032928760,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Cybersecurity has rapidly emerged as one of the 21st century?s grand societal challenges. Innovative solutions for solving important issues within this broad domain require novel, inter-disciplinary approaches. In this project, we developed a team of Artificial Intelligence (AI), sociology, and criminology experts to explore the vast, ever-evolving online hacker community (often referred to as the ""Dark Web""). Specifically, significant efforts were made to collect a multi-million, multi-lingual, longitudinal testbed of hacker forum, DarkNet Marketplaces, Internet-Relay-Chat (IRC), and carding shop data. From this vast collection of adversarial data, novel AI, criminology, and sociology based approaches were developed for two broad purposes: identifying key threat actors (i.e., hackers) and detecting emerging threats in cyberspace. For the former, significant social network analysis and network science capabilities from computational and social science perspectives were developed to identify communities of hackers and key threat actors within these communities. With regards to identifying emerging threats, novel AI based approaches were designed and developed to identify emerging hacker terminology, topics, and exploits (e.g., ransomware, Point-of-Sales malware). Selected results from this work (e.g., data, analytics, visualizations, etc.) were integrated into the AZSecure Hacker Assets Portal and the AZSecure Data Infrastructure Building Blocks (DIBBs) systems to offer value for law enforcement, industry professionals, and aspiring Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) researchers.

These novel advances in knowledge have resulted in 50+ peer reviewed publications at major peer-reviewed outlets such as IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE), Journal of Management Information Systems (JMIS), IEEE Intelligent Systems, Management Information Systems Quarterly (MISQ), and IEEE Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI). Selected work was also disseminated to communities of interest at highly-visible conferences such as the INFORMS Annual Meeting, Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS), and others. Ultimately, the efforts made in this project have made a broader impact in society by significantly contributing to our knowledge about the Dark Web, offering value to numerous law enforcement, industry, and government cybersecurity professionals, and providing excellent training experiences to numerous undergraduate, master?s, and Ph.D. (many of whom are NSF CyberCorps Scholarship-for-Service) students to tackle the next generation of cybersecurity issues.

15,"Considering the growing importance of water resources issues around the globe, this project addresses the  need to train the current and future generations of teachers, students and general public to use cyberinfrastructure (CI) to address water related issues. The overall goal of this project is to develop a prototype CI for data access and sharing, simulation modeling and visualization to address water related issues, and then show that this CI can be used as a platform to train educators, students and the general public. Specifically, this proposal: (i)bis developing WaterHUB (by utilizing Purdue HUBZero platform) to include prototype tools for accessing, analyzing and visualizing water resources geospatial and temporal data; (ii) is developing a prototype framework for collaboration among educators to develop, publish, review and share training material for using cyberinfrastructure to address water issues; (iii) is evaluating and assessing the effectiveness of the proposed cyberinfrastructure and the collaborative framework through application at three universities (Purdue, Arizona State U, Jackson State U); and (iv) is building community through workshops and training sessions for teachers, students, policy makers and the general public. This demonstration project will show proof-of-concept for a scalable mechanism to create water resources awareness among a much broader community by incorporating the needs of a diverse population through collaboration with faculty and students at three geographically and culturally diverse research institutions in the United States. External evaluation and assessment of all aspects of this demonstration project including community input through workshops and training sessions will provide the basis for developing a plan for scaling up the project. 

Intellectual Merit 
This proposal involves a group of hydrologists, computer scientists, an educational expert and an environmental researcher at three geographically and culturally different institutions (Purdue, Arizona State and Jackson State) to develop a CI for data access, analysis and visualization to study water resources issues including collaboration for teaching and training. Specifically, this proposal will use a proven CI, initially developed for nanotechnology (nanoHUB.org that has more than 100,000 users annually), to develop a customized cyber environment for water resources called WaterHUB. The core nanohub CI, known as HUBZero, is inadequate to handle large spatial and temporal datasets that are typical in water related studies, and  lacks the capability to link such data with data driven, computationally intensive hydrologic simulations. This work will add the much needed data and coupling of data and high performance computing to HUBzero to support water resources studies. WaterHUB will be the first of its kind in the water resources community that will provide a collaborative web-based platform for research and education at all levels including P-12. The prototype WaterHUB is being developed to address three basic questions related to water storage, human impacts and energy fluxes by using public domain data and simulation models to address water related problems. This project also involves a comprehensive evaluation and assessment plan that will quantify the effect of cyber-enabled pedagogy on students learning. This assessment is critical in terms of evaluating the attributes of existing and future CI to meet the needs of next generation cyber learners and researchers. 

Broader Impacts 
The proposed WaterHUB is providing the much needed cyber environment to train and educate the current and next generation of citizens on water related issues. The activities will specifically target: (i) P-12 teachers and students through collaboration with Purdue?s INSPIRE institute; (ii) undergraduate and graduate students at three research universities; (iii) state and federal decision makers in the state of Indiana. Through collaboration with Jackson State and Arizona State universities, under-represented students are being trained through workshops and summer internships to use the latest cyber technology for exploring water related issues. In addition, workshop gatherings will be used to develop a strategy for up-scaling this effort to include more computational tools, national and international datasets and high quality curriculum material.

The proposed technology is expected to fill the gap between incorporating hands-on experience into cyber security curriculum at a large-scale and enhancing personalized and customizable educational features that can be tuned towards an adaptive E-learning environment for higher education.

VLab will enhance cyber security education that is very cognizant of the growing national need to keep infrastructures secure, including securing communications, reducing cyber threats, developing resilient systems for the homeland, and for learning technologies in online educational pro- grams. The proposed hands-on laboratory solution can greatly improve the cyber security education?s quality and attract more students to work in this area. The presented VLab will not only be an important complementary component for existing in-class and online education approaches, but also provide a new hands-on centric learning approach that can greatly improve the effectiveness for learning cyber security technologies. Moreover, VLab has great potential to be incorporated into other STEM fields that demands hands-on experiments that can be benefit from such as virtual hands-on laboratory to support their course projects.",NSF,4900,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY,ORSPA,TEMPE,US,Tempe,AZ09,Arizona State University,AZ,852816011,47.041,,03/17/2015,943360412,50000,09/30/2015,4900,I-Corps,50000,1539684,806345658,Dijiang  Huang,P.O.

Product: VLab is the product that is developed for computing educators and administrators who wants more flexible applied-learning option for their students. Unlike physical labs built by the institutions, and simulated labs offered by many publishers, we provide a virtual, yet very real, teaching and learning environment via our patented mobile and cloud computing technology. VLab is a cloud resource management system that provides a web-based user interface for fast development of computer-based hands-on project running environment, which includes virtualized computers, their interconnections, and running software on each virtualized computer. VLab provides fast deployable solutions allowing users to manage their system resources with little management overhead.

 

Customer: The VLab team participate the I-Corps cohort (7 Weeks training) at Georgia Tech, Atlanta in April 2015. During the 7-weeks training, the VLab team interviewed 107 customers in 14 states of United States. These interviews focusing on 4-years teaching-focus universities and 2-year community colleges. Based on these interviews, the customers of VLab are determined as professors/lectures and students from universities and community colleges. Faculty whose main job function is teaching in disciplines such as CS, CIS, IT  heavy time consumption for preparing, conducting, and evaluating hands-on labs as a main pain point; Moreover, insufficient, inefficient, and ineffective hands-on labs were the main issues for students looking to improve their learning with real-world practical experiences. These Educators are important influencers in their schools' decision making to purchase the VLab services for their students. In some schools, especially such as community colleges, the Educators can request that students directly subscribe to the VLab services.

 

Value Propositions: Hands-on labs have become an indispensable part of curriculum components for science education. The main issue of providing hands-on labs for students also demands tremendous lab management overhead for instructors, and usually they cannot afford to provide practical labs due to both their time and resource constraints. ThoTh Lab is to address these issues by providing a virtualized laboratory. It provides the following benefits to Educators and students: (1) Reduce lab management from a few hours to just a few minutes; (2) Provide standardized labs to ease the lab management and assessment; (3) Provide collaborative and interactive features to enable group-based project management and reduce the group-based project management overhead; and (4) integrated lab running environment and related lab guidance can greatly improve the learning experience.

 

Summary: Through the I-Corp training and customers interview, our exit decision is a ""Go"".  To execute the decision, the team formed a start-up company, called ""Athena Network Solutions LLC"". Dr. Chun-Jen Chung was graduated in July 2015 and he is the CEO of the company. The company is preparing to submit an NSF SBIR proposal and working on the connections established through the I-Corps project. Particularly, several universities are starting trial using the system, including California State University-Fullerton, University of Missouri-Kansas City, Penn State University. There a few other schools and universities plan to trial use the VLab system in Spring 2015. Additionally, we have established connection with publishers such as Pearson and Great River. Pearson is now in the state of evaluating our solution and will decide to adopt our solution for their instructors who purchased and use their textbooks for students.

17,"Companies are continuously trying to understand consumer perceptions of products in order to design better future products to meet emerging technical, environmental and societal challenges. The techniques traditionally employed by firms include focus groups, surveys, and observation of customers during product use. However, various challenges exist in using these approaches. For example, focus groups often yield emotional assessments that can be influenced by other participants. Surveys (and focus groups) are typically conducted while the customer is far removed from actual product usage, limiting their relevance. Observations rely on interpretations by observers. In all of these approaches, information is qualitative and open to subjective interpretation. This award supports fundamental research to build a foundation for techniques that provide a quantitative understanding of consumer perceptions and how these perceptions link with product features. This will lead to objective interpretations for designers to act on when developing the next generation of goods and services.

The framework for cyber-empathic design in this research will focus on integration of sensors and information technologies with existing products that allow products to ""observe themselves"" and takes advantage of new cyber-infrastructure technologies to report back to designers. Such a paradigm takes advantage of the ever-improving cyber-infrastructure and decreasing size and cost in sensing technologies to provide not otherwise obtainable product usage data. The specific objectives of the research plan include: (i) validation of a generalized analytical framework based on structural equation modeling (SEM) that can be used to couple multi-modal data streams of a qualitative (e.g., surveys) and quantitative (e.g., sensors) nature, (ii) application of the framework for causal modeling which maps consumer perceptions to specific product features, and (iii) demonstration of direct confirmatory design inference through application of cyber-empathic data. These objectives will be facilitated through human subject experiments in both laboratory and field settings. In an economy increasingly reliant on knowledge, the cyber-empathic framework will provide designers a novel, quantitative and more efficient way to learn about their products and systems after they are put in the hands of end-users. Such understanding has the ability to transform product engineering by improving the ability to identify opportunities for innovation, leading to products and systems that better meet the needs of heterogeneous end-users.",NSF,4900,"RESEARCH FOUNDATION FOR THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK, THE",520 Lee Entrance,Amherst,US,Buffalo,NY26,SUNY at Buffalo,NY,142282567,47.041,"['Kemper E Lewis', 'Arun  Lakshmanan']",07/14/2014,038633251,367927,12/31/2017,4900,ENGINEERING DESIGN AND INNOVAT,372927,1435479,020657151,Andrew T Olewnik,,,US,Buffalo,NY26,SUNY at Buffalo,NY,142607016,olewnik@buffalo.edu,Andrew,Olewnik,T,7166452630,rmalak@nsf.gov,Richard Malak,7032927902,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"In areas of consumer product development and systems engineering, the ability to offer variety in design options is critically important to success in markets that are increasingly segmented. This research has developed a novel analytical framework to aid product developers in connecting user perceptions of a product to specific designed features that influence those perceptions. Such a framework can support better informed and more precise understanding of how design features and changes impact consumer perceptions, leading to products that are optimally design for each individual user.

The framework allows for integrating quantitative user-product interaction data acquired through embedded sensors with qualitative user perception measures acquired through traditional methods, like surveys. Through product case study, the framework has been shown to provide improved model accuracy. It has also demonstrated the potential for supporting specific inferences about how a product or system should be modified. For example, the figures show our assumptions about how users experience comfort as in three regions of (fore-, mid- and hind-foot), while our analysis from sensor data revealed that comfort may actually be influenced by three different regions (black dotted, white, dark grey regions).

During the 3+ years of the project, our research team developed two prototype research products &ndash; cyber-empathic shoes and cyber-empathic office chairs &ndash; and used those systems to conduct multiple experiments. Data from those experiments is available in the University at Buffalo Institutional Repository: https://ubir.buffalo.edu/xmlui/handle/10477/76789.  

The research involved three research faculty, three graduate students and three undergraduate students. The project resulted in publication of three engineering conference papers, two engineering journal papers (with a third currently under review), and three marketing conference poster presentations. In addition, the research team hosted a webinar that is also available in the UB Institution Repository at the URL listed above.

The project led to collaboration among engineering and consumer behavioral researchers, establishing a basis for continuing collaboration. It also integrated knowledge and methods from the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, which was not anticipated at the time the project was proposed. Based on the interdisciplinary collaboration and methods, a number of opportunities for future work have been revealed through this research, including: the primary findings of a framework that provides a foundation for future studies that explicitly tests design inferences, more complex case studies to study the effectiveness of the framework as product complexity scales, integration of big data techniques would allow the framework to incorporate data from a variety of heterogeneous sensors, and developing longitudinal field studies that would incorporate sensor data and user perception as it evolves in time.

18,"This project demonstrates the synergistic use of a cyber-physical infrastructure consisting of smart-phone devices; cloud computing, wireless communication, and intelligent transportation systems to manage vehicles in the complex urban network -- through the use of traffic controls, route advisories and road pricing -- to jointly optimize drivers' mobility and the sustainability goals of reducing energy usage and improving air quality. The system developed, MIDAS-CPS, proactively manages the interacting traffic demand and the available transportation supply. A key element of MIDAS-CPS is the data collection and display device PICT that collects each participating driver's vehicle position, forward images from the vehicle's dashboard, and communication time stamps, and then displays visualizations of predicted queues ahead, relevant road prices, and route advisories.

Given the increasing congestion in most of the urban areas, and the rising costs of constructing traffic control facilities and implementing highway hardware, MIDAS-CPS could revolutionize the way traffic is managed on the urban network since all computing is done via clouds and the drivers instantly get in-vehicle advisories with graphical visualizations of predicted conditions. It is anticipated this would lead to improved road safety and lesser drive stress, besides the designed benefits on the environment, energy consumption, congestion mitigation, and driver mobility. This multidisciplinary project is at the cutting edge in several areas: real-time image processing, real-time traffic prediction and supply/demand management, and cloud computing.

The elements and infrastructures that the MIDAS architecture (see Figure 1) proposes are:

Smart-phone based communication where CVs provide their current locations, traffic situations and, if available, destinations to a cloud of servers;
A Cloud-based Cyber Infrastructure, which is secure, resilient, maintains privacy, that efficiently collects and manages data and concurrently performs image processing and traffic algorithms, while interfacing with the underlying communication system;
PICT (position-image-communication with time stamp) devices, which are vital components of MIDAS, utilize cellular communications to monitor each CV , and guide CV drivers based on traffic-management algorithms that efficiently channelize vehicles using traffic controls, route advisories, and congestion pricing/incentives;
Visual Computing, where the PICT devices use real-time lane and vehicle detection to identify the traffic situation within the roadway field of view, in order to place vehicles at the proper location within the traffic network;
Online Traffic Estimation and Prediction Algorithms, which are vital for any proactive traffic management, provide the necessary prediction using novel models that combine mesoscopic and microscopic viewpoints of vehicles. 
Congestion Pricing Algorithms that, when predicted measures of performance such as heavy delays, emissions, etc., are not acceptable, recommend tolls/incentives and re-routing guidance to move towards more acceptable performances, where the PICT infrastructure provides the recommended congestion prices (or incentives) and parking prices to CVs and to the traffic management system;
An Integrated MIDAS (Managing Interacting Demands and Supplies) Proactive Traffic Management System will utilize the interfaces with various developed algorithms, cloud/communication infrastructures, to provide proactive traffic management. It brings together data of CV?s movements via the PICT devices, and of the affected traffic systems, to provide proactive controls and advisories, to influence drivers to make better route choices, and to recommend congestion prices/incentives to effect travel demand.


The four primary investigators, Pitu Mirchandani (PI, ASU), Dijiang Huang (ASU), Baoxin Li (ASU), and Yafeng Yin (U. Florida), were able to (a) develop and test several of the components for MIDAS, (b) partially support three PhD dissertations (plus two expected in 2018), (c) publish a book in 2017 and a book chapter in 2015, (d) publish over 30 journal and conference papers, (e) obtain one patent, (f) collect 100 video clips available to researchers, and (g) develop two preliminary Android Apps. In addition the four investigators gave about 10 keynotes based on the project results, several invited university seminars and conference presentations.

INTELLECTUAL CONTRIBUTIONS

The research team has broken new ground in Operations Research (OR) and Traffic Engineering (TE) and Computer Science (CS), through the development of new models and algorithms, new cloud computing approaches and new visual computing methodologies. Most importantly, the team has developed a novel architecture for the MIDAS system that indicates a promising approach for proactive traffic management. Also innovative are the PICT devices that use a Cyber-Physical Infrastructure to connect vehicles and to manage drivers through a complex urban environment.

Specific pedagogical contributions to OR and TE areas are:

(A1) Online traffic estimation and prediction algorithms that use a new mesoscopic traffic model formulated in a ""Lagrangian"" coordinate system, with a recursive correction module that exploits the information provided by the PICT devices.

(A2) Congestion pricing algorithms use advanced theories in games and equilibria to develop recommendations on congestion prices (or incentives), including but not limited to (a) pricing on routes, (b) pricing on links, (c) pricing for subnetworks in the region, and (d) pricing for parking.

(A3) Proactive traffic management optimization algorithms that use real-time data obtained through the MIDAS/PICT infrastructure, and predictions from area A1, to recommend (a) proactive traffic signal controls, (b) travel route advisories, and (c) and congestion prices to influence travel demand so that the resulting traffic patterns, both recurrent and non-recurrent, enhance mobility and sustainability.

Specific pedagogical contributions to CS areas are:

(A4) A  cloud-based Cyber Infrastructure, which is secure, resilient while maintaining privacy, to perform image processing, execute developed algorithms and interface with the underlying communication systems.

(A5) Visual computing algorithms that use PICT data and images to identify, in real-time, CV?s lane position and detect the current vehicle movements and densities in camera?s field of view, which are subsequently used for proactive traffic management system.

BROADER IMPACTS

The results of this work will be useful to:

State and local agencies that manage traffic to evaluate MIDAS? potential impacts to congestion, environment and sustainability.
Federal and regulatory organizations that need to evaluate safety of CVs and AVs operating on the roads.


Last but not least, the OR, TE and CS results from this project have permeated into the classroom where the investigators use cases and problems based on this work.

19,"Workflows, especially data-driven workflows and workflow ensembles are becoming a centerpiece of modern computational science. However, scientists lack the tools that integrate the operation of workflow-driven science applications on top of dynamic infrastructures that link campus, institutional and national resources into connected arrangements targeted at solving a specific problem. These tools must (a) orchestrate the infrastructure in response to application demands, (b) manage application lifetime on top of the infrastructure by monitoring various workflow steps and modifying slices in response to application demands, and (c) integrate data movement with the workflows to optimize performance.
 
Project ADAMANT (Adaptive Data-Aware Multi-domain Application Network Topologies) brings together researchers from RENCI/UNC Chapel Hill, Duke University and USC/ISI and two successful software tools to solve these problems: Pegasus workflow management system and ORCA resource control framework, developed for NSF GENI. The integration of Pegasus and ORCA enables powerful application- and data-driven virtual topology embedding into multiple institutional and national substrates (providers of cyber-resources, like computation, storage and networks). ADAMANT leverages ExoGENI - an NSF-funded GENI testbed, as well as national providers of on-demand bandwidth services (NLR, I2, ESnet) and existing OSG computational resources to create elastic, isolated environments to execute complex distributed tasks.

Thompson,7032928970,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The project brought together teams of computer scientists from RENCI/UNC Chapel Hill, USC/ISI and Duke University with the purpose of studying the feasibility of complex scientific computational workflows running on dynamically provisioned cloud-like widely distributed cyber-infrastructure. The distributed cyber-infrastructure included a collection of institutional clouds, which included computational and storage resources linked with on-demand network connections that can all be provisioned together using ORCA control software, developed at Duke and RENCI and deployed in ExoGENI testbed (http://www.exogeni.net). The workflows were managed by the Pegasus workflow management system (http://pegasus.isi.edu/) designed at ISI. The project team developed software elements to tie these two systems together with a performance feedback mechanism called ShadowQ and also provide an easy-to-use portal for scientists to submit and monitor their computational workflows. 


The main goal of the project was to prove that such a coupling between workflows and infrastructure was indeed possible, i.e. it was possible for a workflow to provision the necessary infrastructure for itself and manage it through the workflow execution process. The benefits of this approach include improved usability by domain scientists compared to existing institutional and grid resources as well better predictability and performance and security isolation, which speed up the discovery process and encourage more scientists to use existing resources. Additionally, learning how to execute workflows in distributed cyber-infrastructure represented by ExoGENI demonstrated how multiple different science domains can effectively use federated resources contributed by multiple institutions thus reducing the need for creating and maintaining separate cyber infrastructures for each science domain and improving the efficiency of investments in infrastructure build-outs. 


The project focused on two science domains - astronomy and high-throughput gene sequencing. The two domains were chosen because on the one hand they heavily rely on workflows and workflow management systems for performing their computational tasks and on the other, of their widely differing requirements to the cyber infrastructure that must execute those workflows. The ADAMANT team successfully demonstrated both astronomy and gene sequencing applications at various venues including the premiere SuperComputing conference and generated interest among the scientists in those two domains.

20,"This project addresses issues of cyber-infrastructure usability, a key determinant of CI effectiveness in advancing science and technology. Strategies to permit flexibility in mapping applications onto different resource classes are the focus of this research. The approach adopted is based on the concept of software adapters that express application requirements and interactions in terms of the resource primitives available for a given execution, and correspondingly, condition the target platform environments with middleware to provide the functionality required by applications. The range of adaptations vary, from simple macro substitutions, to substitution of libraries, to programming paradigm transformations, to outsourcing execution of application segments through externally provided software services. On the resource side, conditioning may consist of soft-installation of needed libraries, setting environment variables, staging executables and data, and deploying runtime support software to assist application deployment.

The project will develop (1) the concept of a virtual execution platform that presents abstractions of application requirements and resource capabilities; (2) mechanisms for determining adjustments that are required for the application-platform combination for the given run; (3) adapters that provide different levels of matching and  techniques for assembling and composing them; and (4) middleware for provisioning environmental infrastructure on target platforms  to ensure that all execution-dependent needs are staged and deployed.  This framework, termed ADAPT, is being designed to accommodate the major classes of S & E applications including parallel MPI  programs, scientific scripts, and workflows. Execution platforms will include common cyber-infrastructure facilities such as IaaS and PaaS clouds, remotely accessed capability computers, local  (personal) and shared (grid-based) clusters and similar resources. 

The project is expected to provide insights into commonalities in different programming models and resource types in CI settings, and the developed middleware will permit greater flexibility in choosing CI platforms for S & E applications.

cyber-infrastructure platforms for efficiently executing science and

to effectively and flexibly permitting the use of the best resource in a given
instance. This project has developed novel approaches to enhance the
executability of applications on varied computational back-ends including
different types of clouds as well as grids and on-premise resources. Our
approach is based on: (1) adaptation both the target platform and the
application, via insertion of software shims or couplers to match capabilities
with needs; (2) assembly of adapters that provide different levels of matching
ranging from simple substitutions to alternative libraries and outsourced
execution; (3) employing performance related matchings by determining computation
vs. communication tradeoffs and appropriately placing application processes on
processors to reduce overheads; and (4) demonstrating ways of paradigm adaptation,
in particular to establish the feasibility of using PaaS clouds for imperative
parallel programs. We have completed experimental and software-based exercises
to show that such an adaptation-based approach is viable for several common
classes of applications, and for several cyber-infrastructure platforms. A
recipe-based methodology was developed to specify application needs and runtime
structures to recursively build up platform capabilities to match these needs

dynamics codes, these facilities were tested and further used to conduct
semi-automated performance adaptation to achieve the best tradeoffs between
actual dollar cost, throughput and execution performance, as appropriate to users
needs and platform availability/accessibility. To explore paradigm
adaptability, an exercise was conducted to run unmodified message passing parallel

The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as (a) determination of apurinic/apyrimidinic lesions in DNA, (b) generic engineering of algae to produce biofuels, (c) characterization of artificial i-motifs, (d) screening of proteasomal peptide products, (e) identification of intermediates in the biodegradation of organic compounds, and (f) selective carbon-carbon bond fomation methods and isolation of natural products.

Mass spectrometers (MS) are used to identify the chemical composition of a sample by measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in the sample after they are ionized and detected by the mass spectrometer. Liquid chromatography is a separation technique that precedes the mass spectrometry analysis. It separates a mixture into its several constituent chemicals which are then analyzed and identified by the mass spectrometer. It is one of the fastest growing and most widely used analytical instrumentation techniques. Because of this, it is important for graduate and undergraduate students to be trained in the technique. In addition to enhancing research projects, the acquisition of an LC-MS/MS will transform several undergraduate laboratories. The cyber-enabling of the spectrometer will allow outreach to many universities in Oklahoma that have significant Native American and African American populations which are underrepresented in science and engineering.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF TULSA, THE",800 S.

Through this grant The University of Tulsa has acquired a high-resolution, accurate mass, benchtop LC-MS system with cyber-outreach capabilities.  Currently, this is the only system with these unique capabilities in the state of Oklahoma or within regional institutions in Arkansas.  A cyber-outreach plan has been implemented to make this system available for universities in the region. The system has allowed transformative research to be conducted.  Representative research projects that this instrument has supported include characterization of natural products, study of lesions in DNA, identification of analytes in diagnostic platforms and characterization of biofuels from algae.  The acquisition of this instrument has provided significant research and educational developments not only for The University of Tulsa, but also for the state and region as well.

Broader Impacts

One of the important aspects of this work is a cyber-outreach program.  With coordination from colleges and universities in the region, new cyber-teaching labs were developed that focused on how to use the LC-MS system and that demonstrate specific applications.  The acquisition has allowed universities across the state to have access to a high resolution LC-MS, and this access is important since this type of instrument is not available in the universities in Oklahoma or many of the surrounding states.  The goal of creating a teaching lab where streaming video was used to conduct interactive teaching laboratories between the LC-MS at The University of Tulsa and other institutions across the state of Oklahoma is a timely and needed endeavor.  The availability to use this through a cyber-infrastructure system has opened new educational doors to many universities and students that would not otherwise have this opportunity.  Many of the universities in Oklahoma have significant Native American and African American populations which are underrepresented groups in the areas of chemistry and engineering and our cyber-outreach plan has allowed these students to learn about and access this new technology.  Acquiring this instrument made this cyber-learning opportunity possible and has stimulated the exchange between a diverse group of universities, faculties and students.

22,"This EAGER project is exploring overlooked areas with regard to underrepresented groups, especially women: the interdisciplinary cyber-education of women and the unique contributions of women to our cyberinfrastructure.  The team is beginning to address these important issue in the context of the following long term goal: Train university faculty and students at all levels in the use of cyber-based tools in American Studies, History, Earth and Planetary Sciences, Information/Library science, and Engineering to use of cyber-based tools (e.g., shared databases, internet portals, monitoring devices, visualization, data collection and analysis tools) to gather, depict, compare and/or reuse data to create a cyberinfrastructure-supported scientific and digital humanities community.  
This project aims to: Design a new integrative research and learning program to prepare students in the use of cyberinfrastructure capabilities such as simulation, modelling, and data visualization. Project Goal: The team of trans-disciplinary faculty with their newly acquired cyber-enabled research skills will develop and teach a cross-listed course in ""Women, Water, and Work"", including field work at the high performance computing center (CAR-C), in the Earth Data Analysis Center (EDAC), and in Native American and acequia-based Hispanic water systems. Devise new programs to train and/or retool digital librarians in the development, deployment, and support of cyberinfrastructure tools and services. The University Libraries (UL) hired two PhD qualified Information Scientists to arrive in August 2010 with skills in geospacial data management, data curation, bio-informatics, and information science to develop skills in both library and other faculty. Increase the exposure of undergraduate student populations that are not traditional users of cyberinfrastructure simulation, modeling and data visualization tools, especially those from the humanities and social sciences or from groups underrepresented in STEM fields. A course will be developed and taught by female faculty from the various women studies programs at UNM and will focus on water and women's work issues in New Mexico's Tribal, Pueblo, and Hispanic communities. Mentor teams of faculty and students across disciplines, institutions, and cultures, to improve the effectiveness of cyberinfrastructure-enabled collaboratories addressing a research problem, question, task, etc. Mentoring and training in new skills and attitudes are at the root of the proposal, especially should it be funded in the future as a CI-TEAM dissemination and/or diffusion project. The concept will utilize the emerging ""e-Research Center (eRC)"" in the science and engineering library (collaborative research spaces, a visualization lab, a ""store-front"" for the high performance computing center, a data wall, and the like) to engage students and faculty in planned and serendipitous ways. Use existing and emerging initiatives at the university to  learn how to use, advance, and create cyberinfrastructure tools and services (e.g. open source software development, large scale database design and administration, Internet portals, multi-core programming, modeling and simulation tools). For example, a committee established by the VP for Research and chaired by PI van Reenen, the ""Research Collaboration Enhancement Committee"", is developing a group of early adopters  and a series of seminars to grow the vision and practices of cyber-enabled, data-rich, trans-disciplinary collaboration. 
The project takes a critical look at the potential benefits of interaction and collaboration between the humanities and the sciences based on applying informatics skills and resources. Long-term outcomes, especially in the dissemination and diffusion phases, are to include: 
- More cyber-enabled research/informatics skills and applications in Women Studies research
- Increased contributions of women in promoting research creativity
- Increased recognition of women?s contributions to research creativity
 - Increased use of cyber-enabled and data-rich research systems
Other goals for the project include:
- Developing a multidisciplinary collaborative teaching and research team
- Mapping strengths in Women Studies and past collaborations
- Creating a course based on training the instructional team in Informatics Skills
- Publishing and distributing findings to campus-wide stakeholders",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,"1700 Lomas Blvd. NE, Suite 2200",Albuquerque,US,Albuquerque,NM01,University of New Mexico,NM,871310001,47.070,['Margaret Jane  Slaughter'],08/29/2010,868853094,132221,08/31/2013,4900,CI-TEAM,132221,1026440,784121725,Johann  van Reenen,"1700 Lomas Blvd. NE, Suite 2200",Albuquerque,US,Albuquerque,NM01,University of New Mexico,NM,871310001,jreenen@unm.edu,Johann,van Reenen,,5052776128,achtchel@nsf.gov,Almadena Y.

Such skills and attitudes are generally not taught at universities and especially not in engineering schools

This grant demonstrated an experimental course focused on taking an interdisciplinary, data driven approach to the intersection of womenÆs issues, water rights, and workersÆ rights. We developed a cadre of faculty from American/Women Studies, History, Earth and Planetary Sciences, Information Science, and Engineering who were trained at all levels in the use of cyber-based tools (e.g. shared databases, internet portals, monitoring devices, visualization, data collection and analysis tools) to gather, depict, compare and/or reuse data. All of the above were used to inform the organization and content of the course syllabus. The major outcomes were:

-         Female (36 of 40 students) and ethnically diverse undergraduate and early graduate students enrolled from 17 subject fields, spanning the arts and humanities to engineering.

-        Students used team science and worked in inter-and trans-disciplinary groups

-        Students developed skills to find, integrate and analyse secondary and tertiary data sets

-        Students became familiar with the importance of the huge national investments in  cyber-infrastructure and CI-enabled tools, and the need  to organize and make sense of big data

-        Female students from many fields became aware of opportunities for careers in engineering and the data sciences

-        Teaching faculty from the humanities, engineering and the sciences collaborated using and teaching with emerging data analysis tools. This also informed their future research agendas.

Cyber-ShARE brings together experts in computer science, computational mathematics, education, earth science, and environmental science to advance and integrate cyber-enhanced, collaborative, and interdisciplinary education and research through technologies that support the acquisition, exchange, analysis, and integration of data, information, and knowledge.  During the initial funding period, Cyber-ShARE conducted research and supported subprojects within the following areas:

Knowledge representation that focuses primarily on the challenge of providing information to scientists and other users of cyberinfrastructure (CI) that allows them to trust the data and products that they can automatically retrieve; 
EarthÆs Structure that addresses the challenges of integrating geophysical data from diverse sources to obtain a more coherent understanding of the structure below the earthÆs surface that results in earthquake activity; and 
Environmental Science that addresses issues of integrating data collected at different spatiotemporal scales (from sensors at field sites to sensors in space), to better understand the exchange dynamics and biophysical controls of land-atmosphere carbon, water, and energy exchange in several extreme environments.


INTELLECTUAL MERIT

The merit of the Cyber-ShARE Center lies in its success of the following: developing interdisciplinary research capacity at UTEP; educating diverse scientists and engineers who can work in interdisciplinary teams and are knowledgeable in using state-of-the-art CI technologies; and developing center and institutional-level CI that can exploit and contribute to emerging national-level CI.  All Cyber-ShARE projects involve faculty and student researchers from multiple disciplines. Through workshops, training, and immersion, students learn how to work in interdisciplinary teams.

In its efforts to support collaboration and use of disseminated scientific results, the researchers from the Knowledge Representation subproject developed software products and methods for documenting the steps of a scientific analysis from initial data collection, through processing and analysis, to publication and sharing of results. In its effort to generate a better understanding of the structure beneath the EarthÆs surface, and its relationship with earthquakes, the research from the Earth Structure subproject has resulted in algorithms for the fusion of seismic data and geophysical models. The subproject has produced a novel model fusion approach to create more accurate models of Earth structures from velocity models, an angular density approach for processing seismic data that uses innovative techniques to quantify spatial resolution of the resulting geophysical model, and an optimization method that provides a robust approximated model in terms of satisfying geophysical constraints, accuracy, and efficiency. The Environmental Science subproject has developed new CI to improve understanding of the exchange dynamics and biophysical controls of land-atmosphere carbon, water, and energy exchange in several extreme environments. The data from the project is being contributed to national and international networks and prototype software are being tested by colleagues within the field, which has generated positive feedback.

""Energizing the Future of STEM@Bucks""

Grant Period:   91//15-8/31/17

Funds from our NSF CC*DNI Grant, Energizing the Future of STEM@Bucks, Award ID# 1541343 have allowed Bucks County Community College (BUCKS) to develop a high-throughput science research network.  This cyber infrastructure upgrade has been in conjunction with the construction of our new Science Center and renovation of the current STEM facilities at our Newtown (main) campus.  Through this grant, we have (1) designed and built a Science DMZ in the Science Center to prioritize data transfers between systems located at BUCKS (2) developed and installed an Outdoor High Performance Wi-Fi network as an extension of the Science DMZ and (3) accessed systems on Internet2 to support faculty and student research.  Our institutional partners, University of Pennsylvania and KINBER aided in the design and provided technical services to ensure the BUCKS network meets current and future needs and is sustainable by the College.

 The intellectual merit of this effort has been manifested in the increased number of faculty-student research projects using the upgraded cyber infrastructure to collect and share data using the dedicated Science DMZ and Internet2 connection, as well as the installation of an Outdoor High Performance Wi-Fi network.  As a result, our STEM curriculum and student learning is now grounded more broadly in research as a means of reinforcing active learning.  Examples during the grant period include (but are not limited to):  Quadrotor aerial data collection, Monarch Habitat Restoration Project (engaging math, statistics, computer science, biology, environmental science and other disciplines from STEM), and an upcoming student research study of primary productivity in a local freshwater lake ecosystem.  These projects all involve utilizing the College?s upgraded network, including sharing data with other universities.  STEM students have presented their research projects at the College?s Student Research Conference (December and April), a forum to disseminate findings and an outlet to pursue their intellectual passions.  The success of this cyber infrastructure upgrade also shows us that a science-based research and education network is key in recruiting and retaining STEM faculty who are interested in conducting research that will require such networking infrastructure.  We can now provide faculty and students with opportunities to connect with other institutions to share and be exposed to research, as well as to conduct local research with this infrastructure which was not possible before this upgrade. Finally, BUCKS? STEM Department hosted an ""Eclipse Party"" for the community on 8/21/17.  Drawing over 1500 people with 500 users on our Outdoor Wi-Fi network and live streaming from NASA in Science Center classrooms, this extraordinary event was experienced collectively with the community at large.

In addition to the specific uses previously mentioned, the broader impacts will be significant. By providing a dedicated network with Internet2 access, faculty members and students are now able to gain access to researchers at other institutions for collaboration as well as connections to instrumentation and high-performance systems that enable faculty to use educational and research applications heretofore impossible and thus never considered. Doing so has been and will continue to provide a more robust STEM environment for our students, giving them learning opportunities previously unavailable.  As a result, this will enable them to reach their academic goals and potentially transfer to a baccalaureate institution of higher education, as well as be more likely to gain a career that maximizes their potential as an individual and a citizen.  Over 50,000 jobs are currently available for STEM graduates (selected industries) in our five county region which is 10% above the national average, and will expand another 12% in the next five years    In Bucks County, the projections show an increase of 15% in STEM related jobs; other occupation report projections show that increases will be strong in the growth of jobs requiring highly skilled individuals,  particularly in the occupation groups of Life Scientists, Mathematicians, Information Security Analysts, and Applied Engineering Technicians among others (www.economicmodeling.com).  Thus, with advanced manufacturing, nursing and other science-related activity in our region, this network is directly and indirectly benefiting not only our community college and its students, but also the people, educational &amp; health institutions, and businesses in the surrounding region.  Additionally, BUCKS currently serves as a co-location facility for KINBER and a regional college, and has the capacity to offer our upgraded infrastructure for the benefit of the region.

26,"Cybersecurity is threatened by the zero-day exploits (software vulnerabilities that have not been previously disclosed and are therefore potential vectors for attack). The threat is serious for exploits in the hands of major cyber powers that are potentially hostile nations. Publication of a zero-day exploits can enhance the resilience of domestic cyber-infrastructure (if an adversary has discovered the same exploit), and it could give other countries the opportunity to patch their systems proactively, increasing confidence that they will not be penetrated. Communicating zero-day exploits, however, has the obvious drawback that the exploit loses value as a weapon, because countries could patch their own systems to resist it. Thus, the cost of publication is the loss of such exploits for use in deterrence and/or future offensive cyber operations. U.S. policy has recently begun to address the question of which zero-day exploits known to the government should be published, both to enhance national security and to instill confidence by others. The project analyzes various costs and benefits of publishing exploits or patches, and studies how the costs might be mitigated whether through policy or technical means. 

In a new collaboration, computer scientist, Stephanie Forrest, and political scientist, Robert Axelrod, are developing integrated approaches to the rapidly expanding problem of cyber conflict, combining historical analysis, technical research, strategic analysis, and computational modeling.  This project focuses on three areas where U.S.  policy could provide additional leadership in cyberspace: publication of zero-day exploits; labeling of neutral infrastructure, such as networks associated with hospitals or religious sites, and shared norms to protect neutral cyberspaces; and sustainment of Internet interoperability, which allows Internet users on different networks to communicate directly without interference. The  findings may benefit national security by giving policymakers a way of assessing the costs and benefits of publishing exploits or patches. This project injects a fresh and timely voice into debates about the cyberagenda, suggesting concrete measures for minimizing the likelihood and impacts of conflict among state actors.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,"1700 Lomas Blvd. NE, Suite 2200",Albuquerque,US,Albuquerque,NM01,University of New Mexico,NM,871310001,47.075,,08/20/2014,868853094,102583,08/31/2017,4900,Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace,102583,1444871,784121725,Stephanie  Forrest,,,US,Albuquerque,NM01,University of New Mexico,NM,871310001,Stephanie.Forrest@asu.edu,Stephanie,Forrest,,4807270492,skiesler@nsf.gov,Sara Kiesler,7032928760,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Cyber conflict is now a common and potentially dangerous occurrence. The target typically faces a strategic choice based on its technical ability to attribute the attack to a specific perpetrator and whether it has a viable punishment at its disposal. Providing simple models that highlight the important aspects of formulating a response to cyber attack can help policy makers and analysts, and possibly, it could lead to a more peaceful world. 
Attribution of cyber attacks is complicated for several reasons: (1) there is often uncertainty about whether the perpetrators are acting for themselves or as agents of another entity; (2) data are easily faked, so it is challenging to guarantee the provenence of digital information required for attribution; (3) to promote deterrence, countries have an incentive to overstate their cyber capabilities, both for attacking and for attribution; (4) it is difficult to find responses that are painful but not escalatory, proportionate, and legitimate. Thus, attribution of cyber attacks involves both technical and strategic considerations.



The research developed a game-theoretic model, called the Blame Game, that incorporates both the strategic and technical elements of cyberattribution.   Numerous historical examples were studied to determine how the model applies to cases of cyber or kinetic conflict involving the United States, Russia, China, Japan, North Korea, Estonia, Irael, Iran, and Syria.  

Mathematical analysis of the model showed the conditions under which it is rational to tolerate an attack and when it is better to assign blame publicly.   The analysis showed that, in many cases, it may be rational for nations to tolerate cyberattacks, even in the face of strong public criticism.  It also showed that highly unbalanced attribution capabilities between adversaries can increase the risk of conflict. 

The model is general enough that it could be applied to problems outside of nation state-level conflict.  Children bullied by peers or abused by adults may need to decide whether to blame a potentially invulnerable attacker in a position of power.  Similarly, individuals may be unable to blame large corporations for wrongs if excessive costs have rendered litigation impossible and corporations invulnerable.  Thus, the model applies to a wide range of conflicts and can provides guidance to policymakers.

27,"This award provides support for travel to the Livestock Genomics meeting and associated workshops at Hinxton, UK. The workshop will focus on developing a strategic plan for ""omics"" data sharing and innovative analysis using trans-Atlantic cyber infrastructure (CI) collaborations and also provide training of young investigators on the latest bioinformatics and CI tools. An additional novel aspect of this proposal is to bring together researchers from a number of non-model species communities, to discuss sustainable cyber infrastructure development. Technological breakthroughs have commoditized and democratized production of ""omics"" datasets (such as genomics, proteomics, metabolomics). Analyses of these large datasets are helping in enhancing our understanding of basic biological mechanisms, species evolution, and a full range of other related topics. US and EU researchers are playing the major role in developing these resources and it will be useful to explore mechanisms for improved data sharing. The meeting at Hinxton, UK will focus on the issues related to sharing and analysis of large datasets by fostering collaborations between major cyber infrastructure initiatives in biological sciences from US (iPlant) and EU,(EBI, ELIXIR and allbio). The working group meeting will develop guidelines and explore CI connectivity specifically for data sharing in animals. These activities can be considered synergistic as they are applicable to other US-EU biotechnology working groups dealing with plants, microbes, insects, and marine species. The US-EU ABWG members will help develop a strategic plan whereas the training component of CI and bioinformatics tools will help develop computational strengths among graduate students, post docs, and young investigators especially those from minorities and women. To extend the outcomes and discussion from the meeting, travel support recipients will present a plan for dissemination following the meeting. The invitees include both established and emerging leaders in animal genomics that are both scientifically and culturally diverse.

This workshop was organized by the Animal Biotechnology Working Group of the US-EU Biotechnology Task Force.  The Workshop was jointly funded by USDA-ARS,
USDA-NIFA, and NSF by providing travel support for the delegation from the US; similarly the EU funded its researchers to attend this meeting.

Cyberinfrastructure (CI) was the focus of this Workshop.  The first day of the iPlant Collaborative workshop included hands-on training for a group of approximately 35 scientists and provided an introduction and opportunity to try the iPlant CI and tools. Exposure to, and use of, these tools focused attention on what is available now, what is needed in the future and what the priorities should be.  The key outcome of this Workshop is the understanding by the animal research community the need of haedware, software,
people, data, data sharing, and various other resource needs.

A number of outcomes and follow up activities that emerged from this workshop were:
1) Action A. The ABWG (EU side) will respond to the European Commission request for consultation for preparing future EU activities for integrating and opening national research infrastructures by 22 October 2012.

2) Action/ recommendation 1. Promote proposals focused on co-ordination type projects: NSF RCN and SAVI proposals EU COST. Ideally fund US and EU localized people.

3) Action/ recommendation 2. EU-US agencies should make the integration of biology and computing (hardware, accessibility, service and research components, computational and computer sciences) a high priority
internally throughout their initiatives as well as through competitive programs
to deepen and broaden stakeholder impact as well as contribute to the worldÆs science knowledgebases.

4) Action/ recommendation 3. Reuse, retooling and allowing animal researches to leverage and coordinate existing investments (could be other initiatives like iPlant, Kbase, could be XSEDE, could be NAL) into a more comprehensive CI. This not just about access to machines; the data
and metadata need to be ""accessible"".

28,"""Nanodusty plasmas"" are ionized gases in which particles only a few to tens of nanometers in diameter nucleate and grow.  These plasmas exhibit all of the hallmarks of complexity in physical systems.  As particles nucleate and grow they become increasingly charged, profoundly affecting the plasma and setting in motion a set of nonlinear couplings between the nanoparticle cloud and the plasma which are now unpredictable.  They are of practical interest, because nanoparticles are a major source of contamination in semiconductor processing and because of the use of plasmas to synthesize nanoparticles for a wide variety of applications, ranging from photovoltaics to cancer treatment.  In this project a cyber infrastructure will be developed that will underpin the development of numerical models of nanodusty plasmas.  With this cyber infrastructure, heretofore unresolved phenomena in these highly complex systems will be investigated.
The project involves a collaboration that will advance several different fields of science and engineering, bringing together expertise in computational modeling of chemically reacting plasmas and plasma transport, particle nucleation and growth, aerosol dynamics and computational chemistry.  It draws on staff and resources of the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute and supercomputer facilities at Pacific Northwest and Argonne National Laboratories, and involves collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories on the development of computational techniques for parallelization of hybrid particle-fluid models.  The cyber platform to be developed will build upon the Hybrid Plasma Equipment Model (HPEM), developed by one of the PIs, by implementing a hierarchy of physics and chemistry modules to address the complexity of particle nucleation and growth and aerosol dynamics.  Leveraging the HPEM's existing industrial user base, the project has a strong component of technology transfer, including possible commercialization with an industrial partner.  The project also has an international dimension, collaborating with two research groups in France.

The project will develop numerical models of nanodusty plasmas as well as a cyber infrastructure to facilitate these models and make these new tools generally available.  The project will produce the first-ever numerical models that self-consistently account for all of these interacting phenomena:  particle nucleation, growth and charging in a multi-dimensional plasma; nanoparticle transport; plasma chemistry; electron and ion kinetics; and the collective mutual effects of nanoparticles on a plasma.  The development of such models is a challenging undertaking, made more so by the paucity of needed fundamental data on properties and reactivities of small clusters, and by the fact that real plasma systems are typically three-dimensional.  Tackling these problems is ambitious from the viewpoint of physics and chemistry, many aspects of which are poorly understood, and from the computational viewpoint, as vast ranges of length and time scales are involved, with strongly coupled interacting subsystems and nonlinear behavior.  The development of a cyber infrastructure that enables accurate simulations of real nanodusty plasmas will mark a major paradigm shift.

Graduate students and postdocs involved in the project will work in an interdisciplinary environment that bridges the cultures of engineering and science.  The project includes the development of a cyber infrastructure to be made available to researchers in academia and national labs, transfer of technology to industry through software licensing, and international collaborations.  Through the development of interactive Web-based graphical user interfaces, real-time 3-D visualization, and massively parallel computing, the project will transform the study of nanodusty plasmas, with benefits to researchers in advancing fundamental understanding, to the semiconductor industry in developing strategies to avoid nanoparticle contamination, and to the creation of engineered nanoparticles for applications such as photovoltaics and cancer treatment.

Goldfield,7032922173,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"High technology devices such as solar cells, sensors and microelectronics are made of semiconductor materials.  In many cases, these devices could potentially be improved if the semiconductor material was composed of nanoparticles.  These nanoparticles, only a few nm in size (1 nm = 1 billionth of a meter), should have well controlled properties, for example size, composition and crystallinity.  One method to fabricate the nanoparticles is using low temperature plasmas (LTPs) &ndash; chemically active ionized gases.  In this research project, the science and technology of fabricating silicon nanoparticles using LTPs were investigated using advanced computer models which were improved using parallel computing techniques.  In addition to improving our fundamental knowledge of the nucleation processes of nanoparticles in LTPs, the investigation developed scaling laws to optimize the fabrication of nanoparticles with the desired properties for high technology applications.  These scaling laws can now be applied to society benefiting applications ranging from information technology devices, solar power generation and medical probes.  The improved computational models developed in this project were also used in investigations of similar chemically active LTPs as used in microelectronics fabrication, electromagnetics control and treatment of tissue and liquids in the context of human healthcare.  These computer models have been transferred to collaborating universities and industries.  Several graduate students and a post-doctoral research fellow performed the research during the project, contributing to 4 PhD theses.  Graduates from this activity are now employed in high technology companies in the US and at US national laboratories.

29,"""Nanodusty plasmas"" are ionized gases in which particles only a few to tens of nanometers in diameter nucleate and grow.  These plasmas exhibit all of the hallmarks of complexity in physical systems.  As particles nucleate and grow they become increasingly charged, profoundly affecting the plasma and setting in motion a set of nonlinear couplings between the nanoparticle cloud and the plasma which are now unpredictable.  They are of practical interest, because nanoparticles are a major source of contamination in semiconductor processing and because of the use of plasmas to synthesize nanoparticles for a wide variety of applications, ranging from photovoltaics to cancer treatment.  In this project a cyber infrastructure will be developed that will underpin the development of numerical models of nanodusty plasmas.  With this cyber infrastructure, heretofore unresolved phenomena in these highly complex systems will be investigated.
The project involves a collaboration that will advance several different fields of science and engineering, bringing together expertise in computational modeling of chemically reacting plasmas and plasma transport, particle nucleation and growth, aerosol dynamics and computational chemistry.  It draws on staff and resources of the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute and supercomputer facilities at Pacific Northwest and Argonne National Laboratories, and involves collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories on the development of computational techniques for parallelization of hybrid particle-fluid models.  The cyber platform to be developed will build upon the Hybrid Plasma Equipment Model (HPEM), developed by one of the PIs, by implementing a hierarchy of physics and chemistry modules to address the complexity of particle nucleation and growth and aerosol dynamics.  Leveraging the HPEM's existing industrial user base, the project has a strong component of technology transfer, including possible commercialization with an industrial partner.  The project also has an international dimension, collaborating with two research groups in France.

The project will develop numerical models of nanodusty plasmas as well as a cyber infrastructure to facilitate these models and make these new tools generally available.  The project will produce the first-ever numerical models that self-consistently account for all of these interacting phenomena:  particle nucleation, growth and charging in a multi-dimensional plasma; nanoparticle transport; plasma chemistry; electron and ion kinetics; and the collective mutual effects of nanoparticles on a plasma.  The development of such models is a challenging undertaking, made more so by the paucity of needed fundamental data on properties and reactivities of small clusters, and by the fact that real plasma systems are typically three-dimensional.  Tackling these problems is ambitious from the viewpoint of physics and chemistry, many aspects of which are poorly understood, and from the computational viewpoint, as vast ranges of length and time scales are involved, with strongly coupled interacting subsystems and nonlinear behavior.  The development of a cyber infrastructure that enables accurate simulations of real nanodusty plasmas will mark a major paradigm shift.

Graduate students and postdocs involved in the project will work in an interdisciplinary environment that bridges the cultures of engineering and science.  The project includes the development of a cyber infrastructure to be made available to researchers in academia and national labs, transfer of technology to industry through software licensing, and international collaborations.  Through the development of interactive Web-based graphical user interfaces, real-time 3-D visualization, and massively parallel computing, the project will transform the study of nanodusty plasmas, with benefits to researchers in advancing fundamental understanding, to the semiconductor industry in developing strategies to avoid nanoparticle contamination, and to the creation of engineered nanoparticles for applications such as photovoltaics and cancer treatment.

Goldfield,7032922173,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"This project involved a multidisciplinary collaboration between Girshick and Truhlar at University of Minnesota, Kushner at University of Michigan, and the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute.  The project focused on the development of numerical models of the nucleation and growth of silicon nanoparticles in plasmas.  

Major activities included the integration of an advanced plasma aerosol model with an advanced plasma model, together with the use of high-level computational chemistry to predict the thermodynamics and kinetics of silicon hydride neutral and anion clusters involved in nucleation of silicon nanoparticles in plasmas; and development of advanced computation tools such as massive parallelization.

Numerical simulations were conducted for various geometries and conditions relevant to practical applications.  Simulations were conducted for a radio-frequency argon-silane plasma flowing through a narrow tube, with the geometry and conditions closely corresponding to experimental studies by Kortshagen at University of Minnesota on silicon nanoparticle synthesis for solar cell and other optoelectronic applications.  Simulations were also conducted for a pulsed RF argon-silane plasma with a parallel-plate configuration, with the objective of studying conditions that could produce controlled fluxes of energetic silicon nanoparticles to a substrate for epitaxial film growth at low temperatue.  Additionally nanoparticle charging in plasmas was studied by means of Monte Carlo charging simulations that considered several effects that are typically neglected in the literature but that can be important in nanodusty plasmas.

In our advanced computational chemistry studies, led by Truhlar, we showed that multistructural entropic effects on the thermochemistry of silane plasma constituents (which were previously neglected in the plasma chemistry field) are large (up to three orders of magnitude) and must be considered for realistic modeling of nucleation kinetics, and we presented methods for calculating these effects on both the thermodynamics and the kinetics. We also showed how multistructural variational transition state theory with multidimensional tunneling can be used to sort out steps the mechanisms of silyl anion&ndash;silane and silylene anion&ndash;silane polymerization reactions. We provided guidance for choosing density functionals for studying anion&ndash;neutral reactions in the silane-based reactive plasma.

We presented multistructural density functional calculations of enthalpies, entropies, heat capacities, and free energies for key silicon hydride clusters and radicals in nanodusty plasmas, including silanes, silyl radicals, silyl anions, silenes, silylenes, and silylene anions. We proposed three-step mechanisms for the initial steps of the SiH4 + Si2H4&ndash; and SiH4 + Si2H5&ndash; polymerization reactions, and pressure-dependent rate constants were calculated for isomerization reactions.

This project involved collaboration with three groups in France, including groups at the University of Orleans, University of Paris-13, and Ecole Polytechnique, in Palaiseau.  Several visits of PhD students of Girshick, of duration approximately one month each, were made to these laboratories, and Girshick made several visits to these during which he discussed the collaborations and presented seminars on research under the project.  Additionally one PhD student from Ecole Polytechnique spent two months at Girshick's lab in Minnesota.

Additionally, work under this project led in its fourth year to a collaboration between Girshick and researchers at Lam Research Corp., in Tualatin, OR and Frement, CA, which recently resulted in a joint paper submitted for journal publication. One of Girshick's PhD students was involved in this collaboration, and after finishing his PhD, in summer 2016, he joined Lam and has since continued as part of the collaboration, which is ongoing.

30,"Enhanced Structural Health Monitoring of Civil Infrastructure Systems by Observing and Controlling Loads using a Cyber-Physical System Framework 

The economic prosperity of the nation is dependent on vast networks of civil infrastructure systems.  Unfortunately, large fractions of these infrastructure systems are rapidly approaching the end of their intended design lives.  The national network of highway bridges is especially vulnerable to age-based deterioration as revealed by recent catastrophic bridge collapses in the United States. Two major bottlenecks currently exist that severely limit the effectiveness of existing bridge health management methods.  First, the causal relationship between repeated truck loading and long-term structural deterioration is not well understood.  Second, current management methods are reliant on visual inspections which only provide qualitative information regarding bridge health and introduce subjectivity in post-inspection decision making.  This project aims to resolve these major bottlenecks by advancing a cyber-physical system (CPS) designed to monitor the health of highway bridges, control the loads imposed on bridges by heavy trucks, and provide visual inspectors with quantitative information for data-driven bridge health assessments. The CPS framework created will have enormous impact on the national economy by enhancing public safety while dramatically improving the cost-effectiveness of infrastructure management methods.  The project will also create publically available graduate-level course curricula focused on CPS technology and engages inner-city middle-school students from underrepresented groups to prepare them to pursue careers in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.    
  
The overarching goal of the research project is to create a scalable and robust CPS framework for the observation and control of mobile agents that asynchronously and transiently interact with a stationary physical system. While this class of problem is found throughout many engineering disciplines, the project focuses on the health management of highway bridges.  The mobile agents relevant to bridge health are the trucks that load and introduce long-term damage in the bridge and inspectors who visually inspect the bridge. The task of devising a robust CPS framework will be challenged by the highly transient nature of the agents involved.  Specifically, the compressed time of interaction between the truck and bridge results in tight time constraints on observation, quantification and control of the truck's loading. The project will rely on ad-hoc wireless communications to seamlessly integrate sensors embedded in the mobile agents (trucks and inspectors) with wireless sensors installed on the bridge and with servers dedicated to cloud-based analytics located on the Internet.  The project will design the CPS framework to quantify in real-time truck loads based on sensor data streaming into the CPS framework.  A distributed computing architecture will be created for the CPS framework to automate the decomposition of computational tasks in order to dramatically improve the speed and efficiency of the framework's data processing capabilities.  Finally, the CPS framework will establish ad-hoc feedback control of the mobile agents in order to control mobile agent-stationary system interactions. In particular, feedback control of an instrumented truck allows the CPS framework to control the loads imposed on the bridge for improved health assessments.  The CPS framework will be further extended to control visual inspection processes by providing inspectors with recommend inspection actions based on rigorous analysis of collected sensor data.  The intellectual significance of the CPS framework is that it observes and controls truck loads on highway bridges for the first time while creating an entirely new data-driven paradigm for more accurate health assessment of infrastructure systems.",NSF,4900,"LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR UNIVERSITY, THE",3160 Porter Drive,Palo Alto,US,Palo Alto,CA18,Stanford University,CA,943041212,47.041,,08/11/2014,009214214,279326,12/31/2018,4900,CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (CPS),279326,1446330,009214214,Kincho H Law,,,US,Stanford,CA18,Stanford University,CA,943054020,law@stanford.edu,Kincho,Law,H,6507253154,rbaheti@nsf.gov,Radhakisan S.

31,"UCF has established a Cyber Infrastructure Engineer (CI Engineer) position to serve as a bridge between UCF's Computer Services & Telecommunications organization and the campus research computing community, as well as a catalyst and link to the broader community of CI Engineers.  This new CI Engineer position leverages the research network that is being constructed at UCF. This position expands UCF's capability to perform basic research by focusing on cyber infrastructure dedicated to meeting current and future research needs.  Responsibilities for this position include the expansion of UCF's research network and Science DMZ in close operation with campus IT staff, extension and execution of UCF's long-term Cyber-Infrastructure plan, and participation in the wider community of growing Cyber-Infrastructure professionals at other institutions, both regionally (through Florida LambdaRail) and nationally (through Internet2).  Additionally, this effort helps meet the accelerating data transfer needs of campus research by facilitating and participating in research relating to the use of software defined networking and performance monitoring of high-performance research networks.

UCF's full-time cyber infrastructure engineer position is expected to expand and improve access for faculty, graduate student researchers, and undergraduates to high performance computing resources, both on and off campus.

During the project, UCF was able to:

Hire a CI Engineer to help manage the UCF research network and interface directly with researchers regarding research needs;
Help craft and document research network policies and proceedures;
Expand the research network to a set of research labs at the Institute for Simulation &amp; Technology;
Setup a software definited networking (SDN) vlan to support other funded research involving using software defined networks for dynamic network reconfiguration;
Replace and reconfigure data transfer nodes (DTNs) within the research network;
Standardize the configuration of DTNs for other units on campus.


The most critical objective of this project was to for both UCF CS&amp;T (our IT division) and UCF research staff to each evaluate whether it was productive to have an engineer designed to bridge the gap, particularly when it comes to managing our research network and enabling research that operates within the UCF Science DMZ.  Coupled with this objective was the need to solidify the precise mechanisms of sustainability and growth for such staff in the future.

All parties found the CI Engineer positino and role vital and productive for enabling research at UCF.  The CI Engineer was able to help enable several specific research projects (e.g., the afore mentioned DoD project), and was successful at taking over research network management responsibilities and helping expand research network resources at UCF.  The CIO, director of UCF's Adanced Research Computing Center, and were engaged in determining what the long-term organization and managment of such positions should be at UCF.  All three stakeholders are committeed to maintaining the research network and the CI Engineer position moving forward.

32,"The Geosciences EarthCube program recognizes the importance of aligning cyber-infrastructure activities with the needs of end user research communities. To that end we propose to convene 50-70 members of the coral reef community in two workshops, one held at the University of Hawaii (HIMB) and the other at the University of California Santa Barbara National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS). The specific objectives of the workshop are to: 

1. Define current and future (5-15 years) scientific challenges in the field

2. Summarize data and cyber-infrastructure constraints that prevent these challenges being realized

3. Collate current community data and modeling resources and their locations

4. Identify and recommend data infrastructure that could facilitate rapidly addressing the scientific challenges in the field

The coral reef research community is multidisciplinary and the data on reefs is diverse and complex, crossing biological scales from genes to ecosystems, temporal scales from nanoseconds to millennia, and spatial scales from nanometers to kilometers. The challenge is to integrate across these data sources to identify patterns and relationships that rapidly improve our understanding of coral reefs systems. This effort has been hindered to date by the lack of tools to accomplish this and ineffective means of sharing data or collaborating. This project will support workshops that engage the coral reef community to 1) develop a common vision of the grand science challenges in the field 2) highlight how data cyber-infrastructure needs will integrate the complex datasets and potentially facilitate rapid progress in key areas of coral reefs ecosystem science and 3) emphasize the value of collaboration and data sharing as a first step to changing and improving the way coral reef scientists support each other and advance the field.

As ecosystem engineers, corals provide the nutritional, economic, and structural basis of
an ecosystem worth billions of dollars annually. This workshop proposal convenes the coral reef community and will address how cyber-infrastructure can inform coral reef systems science.

4. Identify and recommend data infrastructure that could help address these scientific challenges.

A total of 53 participants, representing a broad geographic range of the U.S. academic coral reef research community, attended one or both workshops. Participants identified the following science drivers and grand challenges.
Key Science Drivers/Questions in Coral Reef Science that will be the focus of interdisciplinary efforts during the next 5-15 years:

? What processes are relevant to understanding biological responses of coral reefs to biotic and abiotic drivers across temporal and spatial scales?
? What are the mechanisms of coral reef adaptation and acclimatization to climate change?
? How does symbiosis influence the biology and ecology of coral reef organisms?
? How does abundance and diversity of coral reef organisms influence community resilience at local, regional, and global scales?
? How will invasive species, disease, and parasites disrupt coral reef ecosystem structure and function?

These Grand Challenges in Coral Reef Science emerged as consistent challenges faced within and across disciplines.
? Of highest priority was data utilization and accessibility for automated processing, standardization and measurement; data cohesion across spatial and temporal scales as well as disciplines; and application and access to this data, from -omics to ecosystem modeling.
? Rapid developments in bioinformatics and -omics sciences provide new tools to address taxonomic, genetic, ecological, and evolutionary questions, but there is a great need to develop methodologies to efficiently utilize these tools within coral reef science. 
? There is a need for training opportunities to better communicate science to peers in other fields, to better inform policy, and to educate students and the public.

Participants also identified Technical Issues and Challenges in four classes of community needs: 
(1) Databases and Portals, (2) Data Processing, Modeling and Visualization, (3) Education and Training, and (4) Internationalization.

34,"A Cyber-infrastructure and Communication-Based Model to Foster Innovation that Broadens Participation in STEM Fields through Institutional Integration brings together NSF/EHR awards from the ADVANCE, AGEP, CCLI, GK-12, LSAMP, REU, and S-STEM programs, as well as other work, around the I3 integrative theme(s) of broadening participation and the integration of research and education. 

A Cyber-infrastructure and Communication-Based Model to Foster Innovation that Broadens Participation in STEM Fields through Institutional Integration will transcend departmental silos and hierarchical administrative structures to transform the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) into an institution in which faculty are committed to sharing resources, collaboration is supported through recognition and rewards, and effective practices emanating from NSF-funded awards at UTEP focused on broadening participation are extended across the university. The discussions among diverse faculty members and administrators facilitated by the model are expected to stimulate innovation in preparation of students for undergraduate and graduate education in STEM areas and result in proactive strategies that provide effective avenues for sustainability.  The unique mechanisms for obtaining this institutional collaborative culture are the development of the Cyber-Infrastructure (CI) and communication structures (Provost-led STEM Council and Special Interest Groups) that can drive innovation and extend and sustain the impact of efficacious broadening participation initiatives.  In the context of this proposal, CI refers to the technical infrastructure, organizational practices, and social interactions that support data and resource sharing, as well as efforts that cross boundaries within or outside the organization. 

The anchor for this I3 project is the NSF CREST-funded Cyber-ShARE Center, which has expertise in CI and cross-disciplinary collaborations. The Cyber-ShARE Center (using Cyber-Infrastructure to Share resources to Advance Research and Education) brings the experiences and base to serve as the foundation for this effort, which will integrate its work and initially that of projects that have demonstrated effectiveness in broadening participation at all levels of the academic continuum.

The CI will be developed to support the project in the following ways: 1) semantically annotated websites; 2) accessible databases that can be used to inform faculty, staff, and administrators on matters relevant to research projects and data relevant to broadening participation; 3) Web portal that supports networking, collaborations, and shared activities centered on Special Interest Groups (SIGs) on broadening participation; and 4) intra-campus communications facilitated by the Provost-Led STEM (ProSTEM) Council.  Initially, NSF-funded projects contribute data to the CI and other UTEP faculty members make use of this information in developing their own future endeavors.  Over time, information from efforts funded by sources other than NSF provide information to the CI as collaboration among faculty and administrators becomes the new norm in this culture of collaboration.  This institutional transformation involves defining practices, procedures, and policies on campus that support linkages among projects, cross-fertilization of practices, and identification of new research directions.  By engaging faculty across disciplines, projects benefit from discussions that analyze common threads from multiple perspectives. The CI will improve the efficacy of the University's programmatic and evaluation frameworks for monitoring activities and measuring student progress. 

This I3 endeavor allows UTEP to take a more proactive approach to creating a culture of collaboration by establishing the CI and communication structures to enable the study and understanding of professional organizational relationships. The integration of STEM interests at UTEP provides value-added in a minimum of three organizational CI domains.   It is expected that: 1) the number and extent of reciprocal relationships among STEM interest groups will be much larger than the number and extent of non-reciprocal relationships (degree of hierarchy); 2) the lateral, peer-to-peer networks will see heavy interaction and activity, indicating dispersed global activity rather than activity with a few focal points in the local community (degree of centralization); and 3) there will be fewer hierarchical levels for access to problem solutions, and information for solving problems, than a traditional STEM educational and research enterprise structure (hierarchical levels in the emergent portal).",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT EL PASO,ADMIN BLDG RM 209,El Paso,US,El Paso,TX16,University of Texas at El Paso,TX,799680001,47.076,"['Benjamin C Flores', 'Ann Q Gates', 'Patricia  Witherspoon']",09/16/2010,132051285,999970,08/31/2017,4900,CENTERS FOR RSCH EXCELL IN S&T,999970,0963648,042000273,Howard  Daudistel,ADMIN BLDG RM 209,El Paso,US,El Paso,TX16,University of Texas at El Paso,TX,799680001,hdaudistel@utep.edu,Howard,Daudistel,,9157475680,kbergin@nsf.gov,Kathleen B.

Through the grant and other leveraged funding, UTEP has developed the cyberinfrastructure, facilities, human infrastructure, and administrative support that has stimulated interdisciplinary research and education, increased research productivity, and accelerate efforts at the university to promote high impact practices centered on student success.

A significant outcome of the I3 project was the launch of the Expertise Connector (EC) online tool (http://expertise.utep.edu) that allows people to discover expertise, research centers, and interests on campus.  EC publishes individual profiles, research center profiles, university research stories, and communities of practice (CoPs).  CoPs allow a group of researchers with various levels of expertise to organize around a particular topic, share information about their related efforts, and the resources that they have. Through face-to-face meetings, members of the Global Reach CoP, for example, share experiences on establishing partnerships with foreign institutions and act on reform of institutional practices that are barriers to student global experiences. The CoP portal allows people to discover others with similar interests.

Another NSF-project in collaboration with the I3 project provided the seed funding to collaborate with Virginia Tech to develop the Accelerating, Connecting, and Evaluating Student Success (ACCESS) Tool, a student-success information management system. The tool supports:  registration of student success initiatives and activities on campus; discovery of student-success initiatives and activities; sharing of evaluation instruments and results; and impact analysis of an activity or collection of disparate activities on student success.  The ACCESS Tool was launched in fall 2017.

Through the I3 project, UTEP has created a culture shift through strategic programming aimed at spurring dialogue and building interdisciplinary research and education connections. Over the last five years, internal mechanisms have funded teams and individuals to start, formalize, or expand interdisciplinary projects. Examples include the UTEP Annual Interdisciplinary Research (IDR) Symposium, Engagement Encounters, and special events. The mainstay has been the Interdisciplinary Research Enhancement (IDRE) program.  Since 2012, this program has granted thirty-two awards to teams and individuals through a competitive process in seven rounds of funding.  A total of $1,722,906 in external funding was secured by teams funded through the IDRE program in the first two years of the program.  Over the period of the I3 grant, there was a 31% increase in the number of interdisciplinary grants and an increase of 41.6% in the total awards portfolio.  On the other hand, the total award amounts of interdisciplinary grants ($112 M in 2016) increased by 167%.  

In 2016 with UT System funding secured by co-I Gates, the university established the Collaboration Hub, a work space to advance interdisciplinary collaborative projects.  In addition, the university broke ground in 2017 for the new Interdisciplinary Research Building, the first building to be solely dedicated to interdisciplinary research on the UTEP campus.    

Through I3 and related projects, UTEP has implemented approaches to interdisciplinary research and strategies for promoting student success that have led to outcomes in the growth of interdisciplinary collaborations among faculty with impact on student professional development and opportunities (e.g., competitions, recognitions, new courses).  An example of success is the increased number of successful applications by students to major fellowship competitions, such as the NSF GRFP.

UTEP continues to see impacts of its efforts to promote success in broadening participation that was started by the I3 project.  The campus has seen growth in enrollment and degrees awarded at the baccalaureate and doctoral levels in the College of Engineering and the College of Science.  While these increases cannot be attributed to I3 alone, the project?s evaluation documented the evidence of a shift in perspectives of faculty and staff since the beginning of the project on awareness, understanding, and use of strategies that directly impact students (e.g., mentoring, research, and workshop opportunities). UTEP?s I3 project was recognized for its accomplishments by the NSF I3 evaluation team led by Frechtling, Merlino, and Stephenson.

Many I3 efforts are being sustained through the Office of Research and Sponsored Projects, the Graduate School, and UTEP?s Edge initiative that was formally launched across campus in 2017 to promote and support student success efforts and activities using an asset-based approach. The university has also institutionalized three professional staff positions that support the efforts started by the I3 project.

35,"This project, ""CC*IIE Campus Design: Network Infrastructure for Improved Science Discovery and Education"", provides a robust, responsive cyber-infrastructure which enables Earlham College science faculty and undergraduate students to engage more effectively and successfully in scientific discovery and education. Earlham is upgrading the cyber-infrastructure backbone connections of its entire Science Complex from 1Gbps to 10Gbps, adding a dedicated network for science research traffic, and correspondingly upgrading its Internet connection to I-Light, the regional optical network provider for higher education institutions in Indiana, providing high-speed access to Internet2. These cyber-infrastructure improvements remove the limitations that have stifled the effective use of data and also significantly improve the transfer of large datasets and the computational research being conducted by STEM faculty using both on-campus and off-campus resources. Research initially benefiting from this project includes collection of microbial DNA from local farm fields and soils covered by glaciers in Iceland, and computational topology calculations to identify potential anti-cancer drugs and classify protein structures. 

Earlham College has a long tradition of undergraduate participation in research, both collaboratively with faculty and independently, and all science departments engage students in hands-on research within specific courses in their curricula. This project expands Earlham's ability to advance undergraduate science education specifically in the more effective use of computational resources both on and off campus. It exposes a greater number of undergraduate students to scientific research and discovery through hands-on research projects with faculty and through access to scientific resources and applications available through the research and education networks.",NSF,4900,EARLHAM COLLEGE,801 National Road West,Richmond,US,Richmond,IN06,Earlham College,IN,473744095,47.070,"['Charles F Peck', 'Lori A Watson', 'Heather  Lerner', 'Michael  Lerner']",08/19/2014,041129669,347228,09/30/2016,4900,Campus Cyberinfrastrc (CC-NIE),347228,1440689,041129669,Thomas  Steffes,,Richmond,US,Richmond,IN06,Earlham College,IN,473744095,tsteffes@marywood.edu,Thomas,Steffes,,5709614504,kthompso@nsf.gov,Kevin L.

The project focused on upgrading the complete path of the prior 1G network infrastructure from the Science complex wiring closets over the campus fiber network through the Information Technology Services Data Center out to I-Light, the regional optical network provided for higher educational institutions in Indiana.  The upgrade to the 10G infrastructure was completed in September of 2015 allowing the STEM faculty and students nearly a year to utilize the new infrastructure prior to the grant ending in September 2016.

The Cyber Infrastructure improvements enabled by this project have significantly improved the transfer of large datasets and the computational research being conducted by faculty in STEM disciplines using both on-campus and off-campus resources.  This project has positioned Earlham College to expose a greater number of Earlham undergraduate students, regardless of academic major, to the exciting world of scientific discovery and education through hands on research projects with faculty, and access to scientific resources and applications available through the research and education networks.

Earlham places high value on faculty-student collaborative research. Students are therefore being exposed to cutting edge technology in the classroom to help them learn and also getting hands-on experiences working with computer simulations, DNA sequences, and advanced visualizations &ndash; skills that will help them successfully compete in the graduate environment.  The improved network infrastructure has insured that these hands-on experiences can take place without being stifled, as was the case prior to the grant.

36,"The objective of the project is to develop a comprehensive, integrated data management system for the NSF-funded Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) program, called CZOData. The overall goal for CZOData is to support, empower, and broaden the impact of CZO science and maximize the return on investment of the CZO program by transforming capabilities to easily share, integrate, analyze and preserve the wide range of multi-disciplinary data generated within and across CZOs. 

The CZOData design is based on the experience of the collaborative project team in building the current CZOData prototype and on other foundational cyber-infrastructure systems.  The principal investigators at the University of Boulder and the Stroud Water Research Center are Earth surface scientists who provided high-level oversight of the CZOData prototype and provide a direct link to the scientific community collecting and using CZO data.  Team members at San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC) and Utah State University (USU) are primary developers of the Hydrological Information System (HIS) developed by the Consortium for the Advancement of Hydrological Sciences, Inc. (CUAHSI).  Team members at Columbia University developed and lead the Integrated Earth Data Applications (IEDA), Geoinformatics for Geochemistry (GfG), EarthChem and the System for Earth Sample Registration (SESAR) projects.  Team members at the Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington developed and maintain the Northwest Association for Ocean Observing Systems (NANOOS) Visualization System (NVS).  

This project combines state-of-the-art computer science and cyber-infrastructure technologies and international metadata standards with a strong effort to engage the science community in the process of developing and testing the CZOData system.  This collaborative, community-based approach to developing scientific cyber-infrastructure has been actively encouraged by the NSF-supported EarthCube initiative and thus complements those goals (http://www.nsf.gov/geo/earthcube/). The approach with CZOData is based on integrating site-based data with system capabilities' such as consistent data publication, cataloguing, discovery and access infrastructure. These new capabilities will strongly leverage other CI efforts described above. The resulting system will support new CZO research that was not possible before while easing the data management burden on CZO scientists.

The vision is that the proposed CZOData will serve as a model for the greater Earth surface science community. The CZOData project is a collaborative, community-guided cyber-infrastructure project for integrating multi-disciplinary data and providing interoperability with other systems. Thus, CZOData will inform the development of other large geoinformatics initiatives, such a the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), Long-Term Environmental Research (LTER) observatories, DataOne, OpenTopography, the Implementing Organization of the International Geosample Number (IGSN e.v.), and the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS). Also, by incorporating system research and development with graduate education, we will move towards cultivating a new generation of researchers skilled in both different facets of environmental research and in advanced information management and computing.",NSF,4900,STROUD WATER RESEARCH CENTER INC,970 Spencer Road,Avondale,US,Avondale,PA16,Stroud Water Research Center,PA,193119514,47.050,,03/07/2013,047918474,1469954,03/31/2016,4900,CZO: CRITICAL ZONE OBSER SOLIC,1532536,1332257,,Anthony K Aufdenkampe,,,US,Avondale,PA16,Stroud Water Research Center,PA,193119514,aaufdenkampe@limno.com,Anthony,Aufdenkampe,K,6512194076,pfilmer@nsf.gov,Paul E Filmer,7032927858,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The ""Integrated Data Management System for Critical Zone Observatories"" (CZOData) Project had the overall goal to develop a comprehensive, integrated data management system for the Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) program with capabilities to share, integrate, analyze and preserve the wide range of multi-disciplinary data generated within and across CZOs.
Data sharing is a foundation for integration and synthesis of our understanding of critical zone processes that occur both within a CZO and across CZOs. Effective sharing of data in a way that best facilitates data discover, integration, analysis and synthesis, however, can be a challenging if not overwhelming task for critical zone scientists. Furthermore, all CZO investigators and collaborators who receive material or logistical support from a CZO agree to sharing data within 1-3 years according to the CZO Data Sharing Policy.
To increase the effectiveness and streamline the task of sharing data, the CZOData team has developed a number of tools and a set of CZO Data Sharing Guidelines and Instructions for CZO investigators, CZO data managers and the broad critical zone science community. For NSF-funded CZOs, these Guidelines &amp; Instructions are grouped into seven expectations and two options for data sharing. These Guidelines and Instructions have been provided via the Submit CZO Data section of the national CriticalZone.org website (i.e. http://criticalzone.org/national/data/submit-czo-data/).
A number of opportunities arose in the 20 months between proposal submission and final funding, in particular opportunities to align our development with the Observations Data Model 2.0 (ODM2) project (NSF #1224638), with the NSF EarthCube initiative, and with second generation cyber-infrastructure for both the CUAHSI Water Data Center and the Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance (IEDA) data repository, which in 2014 began rebuilding key components of their new cyber-infrastructures around ODM2 because ODM2 greatly facilitates data interoperability and management and interoperability. For example, critical zone soil data can now be searched alongside the enormous data holdings of the new EarthChemDB.
The CZO Data Search Portal was setup at http://search.criticalzone.org to support data discovery, faceted search, data download, and provenance tracking. It enables search and discovery of all 787 CZO datasets from within the Community Inventory of EarthCube Resources for Geoscience Interoperability (CINGERI) Data Portal at http://cinergi.sdsc.edu/discover/. This allows discovery of CZO data alongside 260,000 other earth science datasets from a variety of sources.

The Viz.CriticalZone.org website is a web application that enables map-based discovery, access and visualization of point-observation data. It is a prototype that demonstrates the kinds of integrated searches and visualizations that are possible when data are properly integrated and available via machine-to-machine web services.

37,"This proposal is to collect perishable data on the physical response of the transportation infrastructure in New York City following Hurricane Sandy.   It makes use of a new human-in-the-loop smartphone-based crowd-sourcing sensing technology, called TrafficTurk. TrafficTurk is a smartphone application which enables intelligent, human?centric sensing of traffic flows during extreme events.

The aftermath of Hurricane Sandy represents a rare opportunity to observe transient behavior of a transportation network in response to a significant loss of physical infrastructure (due to flooding and gas shortages) and cyber infrastructure (due to loss of power for traffic control devices). The data gathered by this project, which will be shared with researchers across the country, will enable study of how traffic dynamics evolve after a major disruption to the cyber and physical components of a transportation infrastructure system.

It used a new smartphone based traffic sensor called TrafficTurk to collect detailed traffic information at selected intersections in New York City. It also collected coarse GPS data from New York City taxis to understand citywide traffic conditions. Combined, the two data sources provided a way to measure the resilience of the transportation network after Hurricane Sandy caused a significant loss of critical physical infrastructure due to flooding and cyber infrastructure due to an electricity outage in lower Manhattan.

 

The collected data was analyzed to understand the congestion before, during, and after Hurricane Sandy. A method was developed to quantify the magnitude of the disruption compared to typical traffic conditions. Key findings include i) the traffic conditions throughout most of the city returned to typical congestion levels about 6 days after the storm, and ii) The evacuation prior to the storm caused relatively minor disruption compared to the extreme disruption immediately following the storm. The data collection and analysis approach developed in this work is effective for measuring city-scale traffic dynamics after a natural disaster. While there may be no perfect strategy for moving people efficiently on damaged infrastructure, managing the traffic during the recovery may provide opportunities to reduce congestion levels following disruptive events.

38,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).

This award provides funds for State University of New York, College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY-ESF) to modernize The Center for Integrated Research and Teaching in Aquatic Science (CIRTAS) facility and Thousand Islands Biological (TIBS) field station. Funds will be provided to renovate existing wet labs at CIRTAS and a supporting wet lab at TIBS, and cyber-infrastructure to better link these facilities. CIRTAS is a shared-use facility housed in ESF's Illick Hall.  It spans several departments, and was formed in 2006 to foster multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary collaborations, improve a shared resource facility for research and training, and strengthen linkages between aquatic research on the main campus and at the affiliated Thousand Islands Biological (TIBS) field station.  TIBS is a primary research and student training site. The current experimental wet labs at the CIRTAS facility and TIBS are inadequate for current research and research training programs. This infrastructure project will greatly enhance research capabilities by (1) allowing research requiring sterile and clean techniques; (2) preventing cross-contamination and improving decontamination of facilities and waste-water; (3) improving temperature control for experimental rooms; and (4) upgrading cyber-infrastructure to facilitate collaborations between research teams and classes working at CIRTAS and TIBS by installing a high-speed data link at TIBS and a dedicated line and firewall to allow CIRTAS to host a server for data sharing.  

The proposed renovations are important for successful investigations of ecological and evolutionary processes linking diseases, non-native species, and toxins; they also allow the study of a wider taxonomic range of organisms and the use of modern tracers and genetic tools.  Improved data and teleconferencing connections between CIRTAS and TIBS will allow investigators to link field observations with controlled experimental studies.  CIRTAS and TIBS will be used to cross train graduate students in Chemistry, Environmental Biology, and Aquatic and Fisheries Science. The facilities currently support training programs for undergraduate students from groups traditionally under-represented in science (including the Research Experiences for Undergraduates and Undergraduate Mentoring in Environmental Biology programs). The staff work closely with state agencies and managers to include relevant results from research at CIRTAS and TIBS in management plans. Personnel are directly involved in public outreach, including stakeholder and teacher workshops, public presentations, and SUNY's ""ESF in the High School"" program. With the additional capacity at CIRTAS for streaming data from TIBS field sensors, the PIs will increase the facilities' web presence to include field and lab exercises for teachers, as well as searchable and real-time data for scientists and other stakeholders.",NSF,4900,"RESEARCH FOUNDATION FOR THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK, THE",PO Box 9,Albany,US,Albany,NY20,SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry,NY,122010009,47.074,"['John M Farrell', 'Kimberly L Schulz', 'Donald J Leopold', 'Jesse L Brunner', 'Christopher  Whipps']",09/10/2010,152606125,1470000,09/30/2013,4900,INSTRUMENTAT & INSTRUMENT DEVP,1470000,0963222,020657151,Neil H Ringler,PO Box 9,Albany,US,Albany,NY20,SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry,NY,122010009,neilringler@esf.edu,Neil,Ringler,H,3154706606,eblood@nsf.gov,Elizabeth R.

Interdisciplinary collaborations across the college have increased over the past decade, with the recognition that environmental problem solving benefits from this approach. The Center for Integrated Research and Teaching in Aquatic Science (CIRTAS) spans several departments and was formed to foster multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary collaborations, improve a shared resource facility for research and training, and strengthen linkages between aquatic research on the main campus and at our affiliated Thousand Islands Biological (TIBS) field station, a primary research and student training site.

 

With the addition of over six new aquatics faculty in the past decade, our team is poised to pursue a research agenda investigating the increasingly important roles of (1) diseases, (2) invasive species, and (3) natural/anthropogenic contaminants and toxins in aquatic organisms and food webs. Our expanded expertise allows us to study these pressing issues from the genetic to the ecosystem level. The experimental wet labs at the CIRTAS facility and TIBS were built primarily for housing fish, and are inadequate for our research and training programs.

 

This proposal funded extensive renovations of existing wet labs, supporting labs, and cyber-infrastructure essential for research on our three focal areas. This infrastructure project (1) allows research requiring sterile and clean techniques; (2) reconstructed wet labs to prevent cross-contamination and facilitate decontamination of facilities and waste-water; (3) improved temperature control for experimental rooms; and (4) upgraded cyber-infrastructure to facilitate collaborations between research teams and classes working at CIRTAS and TIBS by installing a high-speed data link at TIBS and a dedicated line and firewall to allow CIRTAS to host a server for data sharing. These proposed renovations are critical for successful investigation of ecological and evolutionary processes linking diseases, non-native species, and toxins; they also allow study of a wider taxonomic range of organisms and use of modern tracers and genetic tools; improved data and teleconferencing connections between CIRTAS and TIBS, allowing us to link field observations with controlled experimental studies.

 

The renovated TIBS facility is being used for many new funded project including projects involving viral pathogens of fish, exotic species, and include training of more than five undergraduate and graduate students to date.  Outreach activities included Great Lakes ecology field experiences for K-12 teachers and participation in development of learning modules related to water quality, food webs, and fisheries.  Children visited the facility for an ""Ichthyologist for a Day"" event.  The CIRTAS facility will be commissioned and open to scientific research in spring 2014 after completion of work on State University of New York construction projects in the facility.

 

The renovated facilities will remain shared resources and vastly improve our capacity for research and training. This project will enhances the research and teaching programs of several early career scientists. In addition, CIRTAS and TIBS will be used to train graduate students in at least two departments, as well as for independent graduate and undergraduate student projects. The facilities will also be utilized in upper division courses in at least three majors (Chemistry, Environmental Biology, and Aquatic and Fisheries Science). The PIs and Senior Personnel are involved in a number of training programs for undergraduate students from groups traditionally under-represented in science (including REU and UMEB) and will continue to involve these and other students in research and training using the renovated facilities.

39,"Gravitational waves and black holes are among the most dramatic predictions of Einstein's General theory of Relativity. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) is an ambitious NSF-funded project designed to directly detect gravitational waves and to use these waves to explore the universe. LIGO forms part of a world-wide network of gravitational-wave observatories poised to probe black holes, neutron stars, supernovae and the early universe using gravitational waves as a new astronomical tool. The construction of Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) was completed in early 2015 with the first observing run (O1) from 12 September 2015 to 19 January 2016. With the first observation of gravitational waves from a binary black hole merger by LIGO on 14 September 2015, we entered the era of gravitational-wave astronomy. The scientific goals of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) rely on a substantial computational infrastructure, which spans astrophysical data analysis, detector and analysis middleware, software sustainability, and computational hardware support. Cyber-infrastructure is as essential to gravitational-wave astronomy as the detectors themselves. This award to sustain and enhance aLIGO's cyber-infrastructure will enable the transformational new science that future gravitational-wave observations will bring. 

The LIGO Data Grid (LDG) is a distributed computational facility that hosts the middleware and support personnel needed to turn a collection of computer clusters into a powerful data analysis engine for gravitational wave science. This award provides funding for the skilled personnel who will continue to support and maintain the LDG and deliver the substantial improvements in services, scalability and reliability needed to sustain the scientific return from aLIGO. The primary goals of this project are: to allow the LSC to complete the analysis of early aLIGO observations, to deliver the software infrastructure and services to support gravitational-wave astronomy with aLIGO and its international partners, to provide the cyber-infrastructure needed to bring gravitational-wave astronomy together with the broader astronomical community, and to prototype tools for open access to LIGO data for the scientific community and the public. This research program will train students and postdocs to be experts in next-generation cyber-infrastructure, push the boundaries of LIGO's geographically distributed, locally-available computational data grid, and sustain the operation of this cyber-infrastructure to support LIGO's science mission.

Recognizing the importance of cyber security as a national priority, the SFS grant boosted the recognition of information assurance (IA) in undergraduate education, funded highly qualified candidatesÆ pursuit of IA careers, and successfully motivated 100% of our undergraduates to seek government employment. The Illinois Cyber Security Scholars Program (ICSSP) created with this award represented 12% of the total national
SFS undergraduate pipeline placement. The grant made it possible for the government to recruit top undergraduates from one of the highest-ranked engineering schools in the nation. Through our program, a large group of promising young professionals have acquired the skills and knowledge to address the security challenges facing our government in protecting the nationÆs critical infrastructure.

The program capitalized on the excellent Computer Engineering and Computer Science degree programs at the University of Illinois to create an outstanding undergraduate scholar program in information assurance and cyber security. Our Scholarship for Service program exceeds the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Training Standards and builds upon the unique Illinois computer security specialization. The SFS program facilitated the placement of all undergraduate students in summer internships at government agencies, including National Laboratories. This opportunity opened up a unique career path that is enabling our graduates to use their technical expertise in the service of government. The scholars benefited from the breadth of security interests at the Information Trust Institute (ITI) at Illinois, and their internships allowed a two-way interaction between a top university research center and various government agencies. Working with mentors in both settings enriched each scholarÆs experience and made the internship program rewarding. Our SFS program, which includes both practice and theory, exposed each scholar to a research experience involving the security of critical infrastructure, including enterprise computing and/or cyber infrastructure for gas, oil, and the power grid. We have also been successful in recruiting and admitting students from under-representative groups and 2-year colleges. Furthermore, the broader impacts of this project have included outreach to 2-year college transfer
students interested in continuing their education in the field of cyber security.
It also offered scholarships that enabled students from financially
disadvantaged backgrounds to consider IA. Finally, the scholarship
provided a way for students to follow a career path that fulfills a
national priority, while simultaneously enriching the security
research of ITI. Our university is proud of our participation in SFS,
our cohort of scholars, and their achievements.

41,"This proposal, planning a workshop to examine questions regarding the security of the cyber infrastructure, aims at gathering the main infrastructure security stakeholders with interdisciplinary expertise on data access, information security, computer network security, data and database security, privacy, and data confidentiality to provide insights and directions toward future strategies for protecting the infrastructure. With the goal of strengthening the security of the infrastructure at all levels, the workshop seeks to determine what questions have to be answered for short and long-term strategies to be successful. Looking at both technical and policy issues and the interaction between the two, the work addresses fundamental questions of infrastructure protection. 

Computer security has three main thrusts: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). Security of Infrastructure involves the dynamic interaction of many components and at different levels: Authentication, Authorization, Access control, Auditing, and Assurance (AAAAA). Many questions illustrating the need for security in the infrastructure remain open. Hence, highlights include: 
*    How security in the infrastructure should be defined and measured 
*    How security policies should be defined, whose security policies should apply to various infrastructure components, and how policies should be reconciled when necessary 
*    How trust should be assigned to messages that control routing throughout the network, etc. 
Additionally, the workshop may also look into: 
*    The role that academic infrastructure can play in providing a secure infrastructure, 
*    Partnerships between agencies and managers of infrastructure systems that may facilitate the creation of a secure world-wide infrastructure, and 
*    Partnerships required ensuring that the technological and computer and information science research challenges can be met. 

Broader Impact: Since the infrastructure of the Internet, albeit fragile, underlies the fabric of most people's lives, economy of many organizations, companies, and nations, the workshop expects to present a set of strategies for strengthening security of infrastructure and a set of questions to guide their implementation. The workshop is expected to contribute in attaining sufficient assurance to lead to a desired level of confidence in the infrastructure and the tools and technologies that support it.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS",OR/Sponsored Programs,Davis,US,Davis,CA03,University of California-Davis,CA,956186134,47.070,,08/31/2006,047120084,,08/31/2009,4900,RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS,70001,0646965,071549000,Matt  Bishop,OR/Sponsored Programs,Davis,US,Davis,CA03,University of California-Davis,CA,956186134,mabishop@ucdavis.edu,Matt,Bishop,,5307528060,@nsf.gov,,,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,,09/15/2006,Workshop: Security of the Cyber Infrastructure,Grant
42,"This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Directorate of Geosciences and Office of Cyberinfrastructure as part of their committment to EarthCube, a major new NSF cyberinfrastructure activity to create a bold, integrated, geoscience data and knowledge management system for the 21st Century, and by three Programs in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (Science of Science and Innovation Policy; Science, Technology, and Society; and Science of Organizations). This is transformative, interdisciplinary, research that enables more effective design and implementation of community-driven cyberinsrastructure that will create an interoperable system of data systems and data types that serve a broad and disparate community of geoscience users with different backgrounds, needs, and scientific cultures.  The research will also pioneer new social and behavioral science theory, methods, and analytics that address new and emerging ways that stakeholders are aligned around big, complex, infrastructure projects.  The research is transformative in nature because it is a first-of-its kind project in which a major NSF community-driven infrastructure project of this magnitude has incorporated, as an integral part of its project structure, social science and an analysis of the community/stakeholder building process.  It also breaks new ground in the developing of quantitative approaches to measure the evolution of collective community and individual perceptions over time. This type of understanding is critical when building trust and partnerships between science and technology communities that rarely, if ever, interact.  The project involves the intimate interaction of social scientists, geoscientists, and cyberinfrastructure and computer science experts, with the results of the stakeholder studies being used to help improve the cyberinfrastructure design-and-build process, as well as guide the formation of the organizational and governance structures that will be needed to effectively manage community engagement and implementation of the final system. This research employs novel visualization tools and will develop innovative quantitative means for assessing stakeholder agreement and its evolution over time. The analysis of data and results will assist in identifing the most effective targets for infrastructure investment and understanding and improving community engagement in the design process, thus ensuring that whatever is created adequately serves end-user needs.

The transdisciplinary work spans three directorates at the NSF &ndash; Geo, CISE, and SBE &ndash; providing an evidence-based path for aligning diverse fields and disciplines in the geosciences to advance and better utilize the cyberinfrastructure for the sharing, discovery, and reuse of data (which includes physical samples, sensor readings, models, survey responses, and other forms of data).  We have conducted three rounds of data collection:  2012 survey of geo scientists and cyber infrastructure exerts through the EarthCube website and NSF data centers (n=865); 2013-2014 survey of participants in 24 NSF end user workshops (n=681); and 2015 survey of EarthCube participants and members of professional associations (n-449).  Targeted data collection was provided for the i-Samples initiative on the sharing and reuse of physical samples. In addition, we observed dozens of community events and provided targeted facilitation support for the development of community governance.

The intellectual merit of our work is reflected in scholarly publications and conference presentations by various combinations of team members.  This includes:  a 2013 letter in Science on ""Open Data: Crediting a Culture of Cooperation;"" a 2014 report in Eos Transactions on ""Community-Developed Geoscience Cyberinfrastructure;"" a 2015 article on ""The Art of Managing Complex Collaborations"" in the Sloan Management Review, a 2015 report in Eos Transactions on ""Committing to Publishing Data in the Earth and Space Sciences,"" a 2015 article in Data Science Journal entitled, ""Build It, But Will They Come? A Geoscience Cyberinfrastructure Baseline Analysis,"" a 2016 article in Environmental Modeling &amp; Software, on ""A web-based, interactive visualization tool for social environmental survey data;"" a 2016 article on ""Framing the human dimensions of mountain systems: Integrating social science paradigms for a global network of mountain observatories"" in Mountain Research and Development; and additional working papers in various stages of review.  Twenty-one scholarly presentations have been made to:  Academy of Management, American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Geophysical Union, Carnegie Institution for Science,  Industry Studies Association, International Conference of System Science, International Conference of Information Systems, Labor and Employment Relations Association, OSTP/NITRD, and multiple university seminars (including Arizona State, Case Western Reserve, Cornell, UCLA, UIUC, the UofM and others).  Together this work and a forthcoming book manuscript is advancing ""the science of science institutions"" -- highlighting barriers to collaboration and the ways that multi-stakeholder consortia can serve as catalysts bridging these barriers.

The broader impacts begin with the presentation of the 2012 data at the second EarthCube Charrette.  This surfaced the risk of cyberinfrastructure experts building out a road map without sufficient end-user input &ndash; an early risk of a failure mode of ""build it, but they don?t come.""  Visualizations with these data are included with this report.  Based, in part, on the evidence in the data, the NSF sponsored over two-dozen end-user workshops to ensure that the ""voice of the customer"" guided EarthCube developments.  At each workshop, we presented the participants with their community's data and compared it to responses from other workshops.  The impact was that many geoscientists came to see that their interests and concerns were broadly shared and that it did not make sense to proceed within separate fields and disciplines (which was often the first instinct).  With the benefit of being able to better see the interests of the stakeholders, we joined with the developmental evaluation team to help facilitate an overall charter for EarthCube governance and subsidiary charters for the Council of Data Facilities and other groups.  This governance is ongoing &ndash; an important broader impact of this grant.  Data from the third round of data collection in the visualization indicates that EarthCube participants have a similar profile for data use as non-participants, which is promising for the EarthCube architecture now in development. 

The first two rounds of EarthCube data are now public:  DOI: 10.1594/IEDA/100535 (Title: EarthCube Stakeholder Survey Data; Lead: Cutcher-Gershenfeld, Joel; Date Avalable: 2015-04-15; URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.1594/IEDA/100535) and the third round of data collection will be made available at the same source.  Also, a patent application was filed and a technology transfer agreement has been negotiated with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  Based on a recent Supreme Court decision on software patents, the patent application has been withdrawn.

The tools, methods and theory developed in this project are informing continued research and technical assistance in the geosciences, in other aspects of cyberinfrastructure, and on additional grand challenges facing society (such as advances in digital fabrication, community behavioral health, community strategic energy choices, and others).  Our broad aim is for societal institutions to be better aligned with advances in science and technology.

43,"This two-year demonstration project brings together University of Montana researchers, K-12 teachers of the Montana Geographic Alliance, and a Montana small business to develop and test a framework for supporting authentic, user-centered, project-based, collaborative learning in middle school classrooms. The overarching theme of the activity is cultural and environmental change in North America over the past several centuries, using initial European contact as a temporal baseline for student-driven projects. These explorations covered virtually all coastal and interior portions of the U.S. and represent the first written histories of landscapes, natural history, climatic conditions, and Native American culture. Although not all left behind written accounts that survive today, paleoecological, paleoclimate, and archeological records, together with Native American oral histories, can be used to develop a rich picture of past conditions.

Using these data, students may compare and contrast information from independent proxies and various cultural perspectives to develop deep and robust understandings of natural and human induced changes on the landscape over historic time, and their implications for modern society.
A goal of the project is to introduce students to a specific suite of transferrable 21st century cyber-enabled workforce skills as early as possible in their academic careers. Students will learn to use cyber-based tools to conduct scholarly research, collaborate effectively with peers, and communicate professionally with their intended audience.

Intellectual merit: This project addresses a significant need in cyberinfrastructure education for our 21st century workforce by providing an expandable and sustainable way to introduce students to cyber-based skills that typically are not employed until the college level, despite the fact that a number of studies illustrate that younger students are very capable of acquiring them. The idea is  that an earlier introduction to the appropriate, ethical and professional use of cyber-based research and communication tools will help students develop habits of mind that will increase their success in future endeavors. Learning to work effectively in groups, including conducting peer review in a mutually respectful manner, is also an important 21st century workforce skill that requires training and practice. Learning to successfully employ a variety of techniques including content organization, writing, layout, and graphic design in web-based presentations, as well as using virtual globes to analyze and display geospatial and geo-temporal data, should be both challenging and empowering for students. The project should reveal to students the power of cyber-based tools and resources for constructing new knowledge, and help them view themselves as creators, rather than simply consumers, of information.

Broader impacts: Through its connection to the national Geographic Alliance Network, the project will pave the way for a national and even international effort in geographic education.
This effort would be realized by individual teachers in place-based, user-centered projects of local or cultural significance, covering a broad array of content domains. The open architecture of the learning activity and its exclusive dependence on free, online tools and resources will make it accessible by virtually any teacher.

Each class developed and carried out a research project around the overarching theme of cultural and environmental change in North America over the past several centuries. Through these collaborative projects, 264 students were introduced to the use of cyber-based tools, including the Internet, Google Earth, and wikis, to conduct scholarly research, collaborate with peers, and communicate professionally with their intended audience. Students engaged in peer review of other studentsÆ research, revised their work based on feedback, and posted their final presentations to a public website.

This project addressed a significant need in cyber-infrastructure education for our 21st century workforce by providing an expandable and sustainable way to introduce middle school students to cyber-based skills that are typically not introduced until the college level. An earlier introduction to the appropriate, ethical, and professional use of cyber-based research and communication tools should help students develop habits of mind that are likely to increase their success in future endeavors. Through conducting their research projects, students learned about the research process, including asking questions, developing hypotheses, finding and analyzing data, and drawing conclusions. Students successfully developed wiki web pages to present their research, as well as Google Earth artifacts to help analyze and display their data in time and space. In addition, students learned to work effectively in groups, including conducting peer review in a mutually respectful manner. Teachers reported that students found their projects to be challenging, motivating, and empowering. It was a first research experience for most students, which helped them view themselves as creators, rather than simply consumers, of information.

Grade 7 and 8 students performed better overall than did grade 6 students, suggesting that more scaffolding for younger students is required for this approach. In addition, studentsÆ attitudes toward cyber-learning and assessment of their abilities in this area increased the most in classes in which teachers also reported increases in their own skills. These findings suggest that providing engaging learning opportunities for teachers, as well as students, is a successful strategy for improving student learning.

This project has had broader impacts by providing a framework, resources, and example projects for other teachers to follow in implementing project-based, collaborative, class projects across a broad array of content domains. The open architecture of the learning activity and its exclusive dependence on free, online tools and resources makes it accessible by virtually any teacher. The five case studies developed through this project, and the published research results, will encourage new teachers to engage their students in these types of learning activities and to inform them of best practices for various situations.

44,"This CI-TEAM Implementation Project is developing an interdisciplinary research environment for preparing a cyber-enabled workforce in the geosciences, computer science, science and technology studies, anthropology, and physics. The project engages students in interdisciplinary teams to jointly develop, use, and disseminate cyber-infrastructure (CI) tools and techniques using virtual reality (VR) and scientific visualization for research and education across three interdisciplinary themes. The project builds on knowledge and experience that the team has gained over six years of interdisciplinary collaboration at the Keck Center for Active Visualization in the Earth Sciences (KeckCAVES). KeckCAVES provides both a fertile environment for interdisciplinary research and uniquely interactive, immersive virtual reality environments that allow users to visualize and analyze large and complex datasets. 

Intellectual Merit: The proposed project enables both students and more advanced researchers to contribute to the frontiers of knowledge in geosciences, computer science, anthropology, humanities, and physical sciences through the use of VR. It extends the technological and scientific frontiers in three new, innovative, yet intersecting directions: 
- Remote collaboration via tele-immersion: Teams are developing innovative methods of tele-immersion technology to enable remote interaction between teams of people at different locations with datasets, to facilitate research and teaching collaboration. In the process of this development, students are gaining knowledge and insight into the behavior of VR and immersive visualization. 
- Rapid Scientific Response (RSR) to natural disasters: Teams are developing CI capacity for rapidly collecting, visualizing, and interpreting data collected after major geologic events. This capacity will contribute to our knowledge of the geologic processes driving earthquakes, volcanoes, landslides and other catastrophic events. 
- 3d Compare: Teams are developing the capacity to manipulate and quantitatively compare digitally represented objects using interactive CI methods for use in diverse applications including 3D digital scans of buildings, cultural heritage sites, and archeological, geological, and paleontological samples. 

Broader Impacts: This CI-TEAM project contributes to the development of a diverse, cyber-enabled workforce by engaging undergraduates and graduate students in the use of virtual-reality-based technology for discovery-based scientific research. The team is engaging students and postdocs across disciplines to co-develop CI tools for their own research and that of their peers, and to develop a cohort of cyber-enabled scientists and software developers with experience working on interdisciplinary teams. Participants in this project will have the opportunity to participate in collaborations with US and international partner institutions. 

They are developing with students and postdocs, innovative, high-quality learning technologies and instructional materials that are broadly adoptable by multiple disciplines and institutions. They will disseminate these technologies and methods by providing software under the GNU General Public License; disseminating software tools and documentation, and publishing educational modules, documentation, and research and educational outcomes to facilitate the use of the tools. They will provide visualization experiences to established, effective STEM outreach programs that effectively target K-12 students.

45,"Genomics, bioinformatics, and allied technologies are having wide-sweeping and dramatic impact on observation and experimentation in ocean science. ""Omics"" technologies and approaches are being rapidly adopted and employed by the ocean science research community. ""Omics"" are being broadly and effectively used in areas that include mapping the distributions of taxa and biogeography, time series analyses and biogeochemistry, regional process studies, assessing environmental change and anthropogenic impacts, and ecosystem modeling. Rapidly evolving technologies combined with exponentially decreasing costs have ""democratized"" DNA sequencing and are enabling the generation of massive ocean ""omic"" datasets by individual researchers, and collaborative efforts by the ocean science community as a whole. These massive ""omic"" datasets and their associated metadata require new cyberinfrastructures (CI) that can coordinate and facilitate data and metadata access, analyses, and modeling. The NSF EarthCube initiative recently solicited proposals for domain workshops ""designed to listen to the needs of the end-user groups that make up the geosciences and to understand better how data-enabled science can help them achieve their scientific goals."" This workshop will bring together ocean scientists and computer scientists to inform and engage them about EarthCube activities with the following objectives:
1. Inform and engage 40-45 ocean scientists with CI experience and/or needs, and explore potential Earth cube opportunities to help solve common CI challenges and needs for ocean ""omic"" data mining and analyses.
2. Inform and engage 10-15 bioinformatic and CI scientists about ocean ""omics"" needs and applications and opportunities in EarthCube activities to help address them.
The overall goal of the workshop would be to develop a set of unifying CI requirements of ocean ""omic"" scientists, that could integrate their data and efforts, and connect and engage both domain and cyber scientists to pursue cyber solutions for ocean ""omics"" analyses.
Intellectual Merit :
The workshop will engage of a broad ""omic"" data user group in the ocean science community that stands to benefit from understanding new cyber-infrastructure possibilities, envisioning present and future solutions to their current needs and engaging in the EarthCube process. The EarthCube cyberscience community will benefit from understanding the challenges and needs of a broad, rapidly evolving, multidisciplinary group of ocean science omic and environmental data users.
Broader Impacts :
Cyber-infrastructure developed for ocean ""omic"" scientists have potential for broad public impact. Examples include improved infrastructures to develop more accurate climate models that incorporate biological processes, improve our understanding of the effects of environmental change, expand our knowledge of life in extreme habitats, and better assess ecosystem structure, function and dynamics.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,University Park,Los Angeles,US,Los Angeles,CA37,University of Southern California,CA,900890001,47.050,"['Edward F DeLong', 'E.

46,"Advances in sensor and communication technologies and increased cyber-connectivity are enabling access to a vast amount of varied datasets. This access is interactive in that one can control what is being collected, how often it is sampled and the granularity at which it is being collected. Such cyber-enabled infrastructures are poised to revolutionize the way the physical world is monitored and field experiments are performed -- with automated, remote, real-time data collection and feedback replacing traditional manual, and time-consuming methods. Although web accessible information is being used in our daily decision making and has enabled exciting new research possibilities, it is very under-utilized in learning and classroom environments. It is not enough for the next generation workforce to be simply trained to view or utilize online data, rather they must be able to synthesize new solutions to emerging challenges by leveraging diverse cyber-infrastructure enabled data sources. The premise of this work is that training such a cyber-infrastructure literate citizen must start at the K-12 level. 

The focus of this project is to increase the exposure of K-12 teachers and student populations to sensor network and simulation based cyber-infrastructure tools. Research has shown that experiments and hands-on activities are an important part of the curriculum as they re-enforce textbook knowledge and lead to better retention. Currently, these activities often are restricted to in-class experiments subject to the available space (the classroom), instruments and resources, and are of limited duration (the span of a single class). Point data is used (e.g., holding temperature to a fixed value for the duration of the experiment) rather than time-varying input (which better models real-world systems). Further, for new, emerging areas of science and technology, students often have to rely on reading in textbooks. For example, a new Kansas Standards for Agricultural Education requires students to learn about sustainable agriculture practices, use of GPS/GIS, and the impact of fertilizers/pesticides on yield. However, due to lack of resources, students mainly rely on reading about sustainable agriculture from textbooks. 

The intellectual merits of the proposed project include developing sensor infrastructure for field experiments, simulation software, and curriculum and training material for K-12 education. These efforts include the following: (a) Developing software and training modules for sensor network based data collection technologies: The aim is that teachers will eventually be able to replace ""in-class observing"" with ""real-time data"" for experiments in any of their science and technology classes, and include interactive aspects involving reactions to real-time input, (b) Developing a ""smart farm"" simulation package in which students will manage the day-to-day operations of a virtual farm, and link it to diverse data sources including real-time data, (c) Promoting inquiry based education by developing lesson plans based on field experiments and simulation software, integrating them into curriculum and training teachers/students based on these lesson plans. 

The broader impacts of the project include reaching out to a diverse pool of students to broaden participation. The project builds upon past successful projects in real-time embedded sensor systems design funded by NSF RET (Research Experience for Teachers) and NSF CRCD (Combined Research-Curriculum Development) programs, and the NSF GK-12 STEM Fellows program. These have resulted in strong relationships with both rural and urban Kansas schools. This project leverages these connections to train a diverse population set. The project is reaching out to rural under-served school districts in Kansas and those with significant Hispanic population. The focus on agricultural applications via Smart Farm simulations enables the project to reach student populations that have historically been underserved. By making the software web-accessible, the project is working to minimize the ""Technology Gap"" between those students who have broadband access and state-of-the-art computing hardware in their homes, and those who have outdated or no equipment. The team is continuing to work with existing programs at Kansas State University such as GROW and EXCITE which bring middle and high school girls to campus, and with the Kan-Ed program whose purpose is to provide state-wide collaboration and information exchange opportunities among educational institutions in Kansas.",NSF,4900,KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY,2 FAIRCHILD HALL,Manhattan,US,Manhattan,KS01,Kansas State University,KS,665061100,47.070,"['Jacqueline D Spears', 'Naiqian  Zhang', 'Nathan  Bean']",08/03/2011,929773554,249999,07/31/2015,4900,CI-TEAM,249999,1135564,041146432,Mitchell L Neilsen,,Manhattan,US,Manhattan,KS01,Kansas State University,KS,665061103,neilsen@ksu.edu,Mitchell,Neilsen,L,7855327918,sprasad@nsf.gov,Sushil Prasad,7032925059,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The focus of this project was to increase the exposure of K-12 teachers and student populations to sensor network and simulation based cyber-infrastructure tools.  Specifically, we developed software and training modules for sensor data collection technologies, developed a æsmart farmÆ simulation package, and conducted teacher trainings with these materials.

In-Service Teacher Development

Ten K-12 teachers were brought to our campus in the Summer of 2014 for a one-week intensive training session on agriculturally-based sensor technologies and the SmartFarm simulation software, with an emphasis on utilizing them within their classrooms in an inquiry-based instructional approach.  These teachers then took these skills and applied them during the 2014-2015 school year, reaching more than 200 K-12 students.

Sensor Technology Modules

Training modules and curriculum materials were developed for sensor technologies used in agriculture, including the use of cameras (both conventional and infrared) to assess photosynthetic biomass using Normalized Differentiated Vegetation Index (NVDI), using sensors to control irrigation systems, using cameras to compare plant phenotypes, and using subdermal sensors to track livestock movement and assess health status.

SmartFarm Software

The centerpiece of the project was an agricultural simulation game &ndash; SmartFarm &ndash; which allows students to create and manage their own farms with a mixture of real-world and simulated data.  For example, in setting up the boundaries of their farms, the students can specify the boundaries with a Google Maps interface, or use a GPS-equipped mobile device to walk the boundaries of real-world fields.  Weather can be simulated using a probability model or can be created from historical data.  The software was released under the MIT Open Source License and is available at: http://github.com/ZombiePaladin/SmartFarm.

""Hackable Glass Box"" Simulations

The SmartFarm software itself went through many iterations as we tackled the challenge of incorporating 20- and 30-year old simulation software into a modern web-based game, which eventually consisted of rebuilding much of the simulation code in modern languages.  Along the way we came to realize some of the most important learning opportunities were being buried in the simulation code, which students had no direct way to interact with.  It was becoming, in engineering terms, a ""Black Box"", a component that takes input and output from a user without the user understanding its function.  This represented a significant loss of learning opportunities, and one we strove to overturn.

From this desire we developed the concept of a ""hackable glass box"" simulation, one in which not only are the underlying simulation algorithms exposed to the user (the glass box), but they are tweakable (hackable).  Each simulation model &ndash; the weather, nutrient movement in the soil, water movement through soil, plants, and atmosphere, and the plants growth, are implemented in SmartFarm using the Blockly block-based programming environment developed by Google.  Students can tweak existing models, exploring what happens when new strains of wheat can survive and thrive on 20% less water, or potential impacts climate change might have on crops.  Moreover, students can create their own models from scratch &ndash; one of our curriculum projects involved doing just that &ndash; raising test crops and statistically deriving a growth model from observations.  This idea of a hackable glass box simulation has impact far beyond this one project &ndash; it can be applied in any situation where modeling can be part of the learning process.

Proposal Title: 
Collaborative Research: Cyber-Infrastructure-Based Engineering Repositories for Undergraduates (CIBER-U)

Project Abstract:
This CI-Team will demonstrate how digital design repositories can be used to enhance instruction and learning in engineering undergraduate curricula through the development of CIBER-U: Cyber-Infrastructure-Based Engineering Repositories for Undergraduates.  In particular, the National Design Repository of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) data for consumer and industrial products will be extended to enhance instruction and learning in freshmen-, sophomore-, junior-, and senior-level engineering design courses, including related issues with respect to accessing, storing, searching, and reusing CAD models and data.  The project will be implemented in seven undergraduate engineering design courses at the partner institutions, which include the Pennsylvania State University, the University of Missouri-Rolla, the University at Buffalo, and Drexel University.  The impact on the educational experience, learning, and practical knowledge of the undergraduate students who will interact with the National Design Repository through the resulting CIBER-U will also be assessed as part of the project.  

The results of this research will lead to a novel, multi-university educational experience that is mutually beneficial.  Specifically, the National Design Repository will be frequently populated, updated, and put to use while simultaneously helping advance systematic and coordinated methods to access, store, search, and reuse CAD models and data.  The research pairs two design repository developers with several active users and their students to realize a high-impact application of advanced cyber-infrastructure for allied engineering education.  The diversity and strength of the undergraduate engineering programs represented in the proposal will prepare a new generation of engineers to develop, exploit, and promote the use of digital design repositories to support product design.  These students will be exposed to tools and technologies that are representative of those that will shape the growth of the cyber-infrastructure and are currently preferred by companies in technology-intensive industries such as automotive and aerospace.  In two years, 1700+ undergraduate students will participate in CIBER-U, helping to prepare them to enter the workforce with a more effective understanding of working in a distributed, technology-mediated environment.  The team will also engage 200+ high school students in CIBER-U through ongoing summer high school outreach activities.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM,300 W 12th Street,Rolla,US,Rolla,MO08,Missouri University of Science and Technology,MO,654096506,47.070,,09/12/2005,804883767,,12/31/2008,4900,CI-TEAM,72647,0537389,006326904,Robert B Stone,300 W 12th Street,Rolla,US,Rolla,MO08,Missouri University of Science and Technology,MO,654096506,rob.stone@oregonstate.edu,Robert,Stone,B,5417373638,@nsf.gov,,,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,,01/01/2006,CI-Team:    Collaborative Research:    Cyber-Infrastructure-Based Engineering Repositories for Undergraduates (CIBER-U),Grant

51,"Workflows, especially data-driven workflows and workflow ensembles are becoming a centerpiece of modern computational science. However, scientists lack the tools that integrate the operation of workflow-driven science applications on top of dynamic infrastructures that link campus, institutional and national resources into connected arrangements targeted at solving a specific problem. These tools must (a) orchestrate the infrastructure in response to application demands, (b) manage application lifetime on top of the infrastructure by monitoring various workflow steps and modifying slices in response to application demands, and (c) integrate data movement with the workflows to optimize performance.
 
Project ADAMANT (Adaptive Data-Aware Multi-domain Application Network Topologies) brings together researchers from RENCI/UNC Chapel Hill, Duke University and USC/ISI and two successful software tools to solve these problems: Pegasus workflow management system and ORCA resource control framework, developed for NSF GENI. The integration of Pegasus and ORCA enables powerful application- and data-driven virtual topology embedding into multiple institutional and national substrates (providers of cyber-resources, like computation, storage and networks). ADAMANT leverages ExoGENI - an NSF-funded GENI testbed, as well as national providers of on-demand bandwidth services (NLR, I2, ESnet) and existing OSG computational resources to create elastic, isolated environments to execute complex distributed tasks. This approach improves the performance of these applications and, by explicitly including data movement planning into the application workflow, enables new unique capabilities for distributed data-driven ""Big Science"" applications.",NSF,4900,DUKE UNIVERSITY,"2200 W.

The distributed cyber-infrastructure included a collection of institutional clouds, which included computational and storage resources linked with on-demand network connections that can all be provisioned together using ORCA control software, developed at Duke and RENCI and deployed in ExoGENI testbed (http://www.exogeni.net). The workflows were managed by the Pegasus workflow management system (http://pegasus.isi.edu/) designed at ISI. The project team developed software elements to tie these two systems together with a performance feedback mechanism called ShadowQ and also provide an easy-to-use portal for scientists to submit and monitor their computational workflows. 

The main goal of the project was to prove that such a coupling between workflows and infrastructure was indeed possible, i.e. it was possible for a workflow to provision the necessary infrastructure for itself and manage it through the workflow execution process. The benefits of this approach include improved usability by domain scientists compared to existing institutional and grid resources as well better predictability and performance and security isolation, which speed up the discovery process and encourage more scientists to use existing resources. 

The project focused on two science domains - astronomy and high-throughput gene sequencing. The two domains were chosen because they rely heavily on workflow management systems and have widely differing computational requirements. The ADAMANT team demonstrated support for workflows from these domains at various venues including the SuperComputing (SC) conference. 

The astronomy application used was the Montage image mosaic engine from the NASAÆs Infrared Processing and Analysis Center. Montage contains a suite of tools to analyze, reproject, rectify, and co-add images taken by telescopes, such as the Spitzer.  The steps in the workflow include reprojecting the input images, background correction, and adding the resulting pixels into the final output image. Telescopes takes a large number of images at high resolution, and the workflow can take these images, usually hundreds or thousands at the same time, and provide background corrected overview images to the astronomers. Processed images such as these are also commonly used by scientist outside the astronomy community, and the general public. The ADAMANT infrastructure benefits these workflows as the large amount of input data is usually hosted at some remote data service. By making the infrastructure and the workflow management system more aware of each other and each othersÆ requirements, smarter decisions can be made about how to best access this remote data, including creating virtual dedicated network paths from the data source to the workflow execution environment. 

The RENCI team has developed an informatics infrastructure to process and analyze full and exomic genomic sequencing data generated at UNC using a combination of cluster-based computing hardware and software. While successful in processing thousands of genomic samples, the work has exposed multiple challenges with the state-of-the-art in large-scale workflow processing that result from the complexity of the systems and software involved, the lack of cloud-based models for scaling in response to demand, and the challenges inherent in processing large-scale data sets that are distributed across institution. We believe these challenges will increase as data sets continue to grow in size, as the need to share data sets increases, and as security and privacy concerns around sharing of data continue to increase.

52,"Manufacturing is typically a capital and skill intensive industry. However, with advances in manufacturing technologies and cyber infrastructure, the barrier to entry into manufacturing has been significantly reduced. Today, it is possible for a company to establish a manufacturing facility with machine tools and 3D printers, conduct business through Internet, and supply parts to customers across the country and around the world. By extension, it is possible to form a vision of a pervasive, cyber-enabled manufacturing environment which links providers and customers of manufacturing technologies, services, and products. The participants are geographically dispersed, but are connected by the cyber infrastructure. To explore and enable this concept, the objective of the project is to increase the understanding of the mechanisms and technologies needed for creating an innovative cyber-enabled manufacturing system. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will create and test a platform for trading manufacturing activities online. The developed cyber-enabled system will allow entities of different sizes to participate, collaborate, and compete. The results of the work can promote grassroots manufacturing and potentially lead to a widespread manufacturing industry thriving in rural small towns and inner cities across America.

This EAGER project will study two critical enablers for building a pervasive cyber-enabled manufacturing system - a system that can be perceived as the eBay of manufacturing. The tasks involve analysis and synthesis of manufacturing and cyberspace knowledge. The research team will investigate, design, prototype, and test a scalable online platform to match supply and demand of manufacturing products and services. As the suppliers of manufacturing activities have different capabilities, capacities, and costs and the customers have different technical requirements and budget constraints, efficient and effective online dynamic matching algorithms, based on a combinatorial auction approach, will be designed to facilitate online job transactions. The second focus of the project is to design, develop, and evaluate robust plug-and-play machine controller and manufacturing process instructions. To connect users through plug-and-play, a web-based depository will be created for transmitting (drop-off and pick-up) part design and manufacturing information. The model-based approach will be applied to understand and improve the robustness of plug-and-play 3D printing and machining. Simulation of online transactions will be conducted to test the reliability and scalability of the prototype system.",NSF,4900,TEXAS A&M ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,TEES State Headquarters Bldg.,College Station,US,College Station,TX17,Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station,TX,778454645,47.041,"['V.

53,"Large-scale collaborative science is of increasing importance, but relatively little empirical evidence is available to guide the creation and operation of these multi-stakeholder efforts.  Previous social science research on stakeholder alignment in industrial relations and organizational studies is only now beginning to be applied to scientific consortia.  Early results indicate that social science tools and methods can play a key role in enabling coordinated, cross-organizational alignment. New techniques for identifying stakeholders, assessing interests, and visualizing alignment are beginning to emerge, but require additional refinement. This is a time-bound, demonstration case for applying stakeholder alignment methods initially advanced under the NSF study of 'Stakeholder Alignment in Socio-Technical Systems' (NSF-VOSS 0956472).  This case will demonstrate new ways for stakeholders in complex systems to better visualize and analyze core interests (common and conflicting) in order to more quickly and more comprehensively achieve the alignment needed for understanding and action.  It is anticipated that this application of the methods will highlight needed areas for further instrumentation, validation, and enhancement.

The NSF EarthCube initiative represents a novel approach to rapid development of community-guided cyber infrastructure to integrate data and information for knowledge management across the Geosciences.  Optimizing these activities will require a deep understanding of stakeholder interests, including points of alignment (or misalignment).  This project will identify EarthCube stakeholders and their interests and develop, administer, and analyze the results of an initial stakeholder alignment survey to assess the state of the EarthCube cyber infrastructure, geoscience, and computer science communities prior to the planned June community meeting.  Timely feedback on this survey will be central to the success of the overall EarthCube effort, and enable longitudinal analysis of changes as the EarthCube process moves from separate communities, through the initial organization of emergent interdisciplinary teams and eventual community integration.  Stakeholder alignment is hypothesized to play an important role in community coalescence and team development and to affect the likelihood of successfully defining system requirements and building prototypes.  This project provides an opportunity to test the applicability of innovative stakeholder alignment techniques to emerging geo-sciences, cyber infrastructure and computer science partnerships focused on developing common frameworks for sharing research data.

Improved stakeholder alignment will substantially enhance the success and impact of EarthCube.  The resulting cyber infrastructure will create value and mitigate risk in domains touched by the geosciences.  Further, based on this demonstration case, applications to a wide range of NSF investments may be appropriate.  These tools and methods for stakeholder alignment represent potentially high impact enablers across our societal institutions that are of ever greater importance in an era of accelerating change.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS,SUITE A,CHAMPAIGN,US,Champaign,IL13,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,IL,618207473,47.070,"['Michael  Haberman', 'Joseph Mark  Nolan']",02/23/2012,041544081,129030,02/28/2014,4900,VIRTUAL ORGANIZATIONS,129030,1229928,041544081,Joel E Cutcher-Gershenfeld,504 E.

This was motivated by the need to share data, tools, and models across fields and disciplines to advance normal science and to address ""grand challenge"" issues such as global climate change and severe weather prediction.  A community of approximately 200 stakeholders had been engaged in shaping the initiative in promising ways.  In order to maximize future success, however, a deeper understanding of stakeholder interests, including points of alignment (or misalignment) was needed.  Moreover, this understanding had severe urgency since baseline data on stakeholder alignment is needed at this launch point, and in advance of a meeting of stakeholders in June, 2012 (the data was needed to help plan the event and share with stakeholders at the event).  This proposal was submitted as a RAPID proposal since the data to be collected were ephemeral and had severe urgency.  Overall, the goal was to use stakeholder data to ensure that the NSF investments in cyberinfrastructure were aligned with the diverse needs, requirements and social system capabilities across the geosciences.

Under the grant, we developed and administered a stakeholder alignment survey for geoscientists and computer/cyber scientists to assess technical and social aspects of the sharing of data, tools and models to enable normal science and ""grand challenge"" research in the geosciences.  The results were fed back in ways to accelerate progress toward a successful cyberinfrastructure (and to avoid a ""build it, but insufficient people come"" failure mode).

 A set of 20 stakeholder roles were identified, including major geoscience fields and disciplines, as well as other associated categories (such as data mangers and K-12 educators)&bull; A survey instrument spanning key interests associated with the cyberinfrastructure was developed with input from a panel of experts &bull; Data were collected from 686 respondents, including 564 from data centers and 120 from the EarthCube website, with the following distribution based on EarthCube involvement:None/Low Involvement (n=588)  First I have heard of EarthCube 47%  Aware of EarthCube, but no engagement 28%  Visited the EarthCube website 11%High Involvement (n=97)  Participated in EarthCube discussions   6%  Actively involved in EarthCube communities   7%  Leadership role in EarthCube communities   2%.  Three keynote addresses were delivered, each approximately 20 minutes in length, with small group and full group dialogue on each of the three days of the 2012 June EarthCube Charrette.  Key findings included a large gap between the importance of access to data, tools, and models within fields/disciplines (mean of .86 on a scale from 0-1) and across fields/disciplines (mean of .71) as compared to the reported ease of access within fields/disciplines (mean of .42) and across fields/disciplines (mean of .32). Detailed findings along various dimensions were incorporated into EarthCube planning and decision making

Based in part on the data from the stakeholder survey, the NSF slowed down the technology roadmapping and decided to launch a series of ""domain workshops"" aimed at better eliciting the ""voice of the customer"" across diverse fields and diciplines.  Under the auspices of a subsequent INSPIRE grant (1249607), additional stakeholder data collection has preceded each domain workshop and been presented as an input into workshop dialogue (for over a dozen workshops to date)&bull; An Early Career workshop was among the first domain workshops that featured assistant professors, postdocs, and graduate students from across 42 relevant NSF program areas&bull; Scholarly research with the data is continuing at an intensive pace&...",,,03/01/2012,RAPID: Stakeholder Alignment for EarthCube,Grant

This proposal intends to design algorithms and protocols for a Semantic Routed Network for sensor data based cyber infrastructure. This project will design technologies (protocols and algorithms) that support high-level resource (data/service) discovery in sensor networks and data archives. The novel aspects of this proposal include mechanism for easy and automatic discovery of sensors for variety of tasks. This will enable easy manipulation of sensor data, services and data archives in an intelligent cyber infrastructure. Many useful and interesting sensor based applications and cyber physical systems would be possible if such an intelligent cyber infrastructure is available.

Broader Impact

A vision of this project is to increase the potential user community for atmospheric and earth science sensor data by removing the need of device level understanding about how to identify useful sensors and use them. When successful, the increased access to these sensors and data resources will enhance scientific productivity and improve decision making regarding public utilities and services. Observing any phenomena or collecting any information with sensors will be as easy as searching the internet, querying a database, or as economical as putting up a web application on the internet.

It may simply consist of smart materials that can adapt to temperature changes or stress status, or a structure that includes smart sensors to help the structure to perform adaptations. SI technologies have resulted from the integration and deployment of innovative technologies developed from several NSF initiatives on sensing technology, information technology, high performance materials, cyber infrastructure, and computational science and engineering. Applications of SI technologies to transportation infrastructure are emerging and require vision development and multidisciplinary collaborations of researchers in the areas of smart technologies, sensor development and deployment, computational simulation, and transportation infrastructure design, construction, operation and maintenance. The objectives of this workshop are to 1) brain storm on and present vision and perspectives for smart and resilient transportation infrastructure; 2) identify promising technologies and tools for smart transportation infrastructure; 3) identify barriers and research needs for developing smart transportation infrastructure; and 4) discuss potential national and international collaborations for a partnership among academic institutions, industries and governmental agencies.   It is anticipated that the outcome of the workshop would include the development of a systematical outline for directions of future research, development, deployment and education; and provision of a forum for researchers in different disciplines to team up for synergistic programs.

B.   Research and Education Needs Statements

The workshop develops the needs statemenst for research and education in the following three categories.

Multifunctional Material

According to the discussion at the workshop, the long term performance and durability need to be enhanced. The researchers should pay attention to how to restore an application if one of its functions has failed. Some critical research priorities have been emphasized:

a)  Flexible electronic components;

b)  Methodologies of sending signal from embedded sensors;

c)  Designing of the schemes to capture only ""critical performance metrics"";

d)  Data storage and exchange standardization;

e)  Indicating degradation and durability using chemical sensors;

f)   Matching low power generation with sensors to consume lower power;

g)  How to utilize new materials in market and approve the practice of those materials for 5-7 years by sensing technology;

h)  Methodologies to define performance requirements for the material.

The universities, decision makers, industry and society should setup joint courses, delivery mechanisms and continuing education. They also should use field demonstrations to deliver the messages and find the methodologies for effective use of such demonstrations.

56,"The Cyber-ShARE (""Cyberinfrastructure for Sharing resources to Advance Research and Education"") Center of Excellence at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) was established in 2007 with a mission to advance education and research through cyberinfrastructures that support information exchange and integration, as well as collaborative interdisciplinary research. The Center conducts research and prepares a workforce that can tackle some of the most challenging problems confronting society. The interdisciplinary research at the Center has resulted in tools and approaches that support scholarly interdisciplinary collaboration by facilitating the ability to share knowledge, concepts, approaches, and perspectives. As national leaders in the study of collaborative science and engineering, the Center has developed and applied models of team-based, cooperative learning, interdisciplinary teamwork, and knowledge integration. Areas of advancement in cyberinfrastructure (CI) have been in data management, data analysis, and virtual organizations in support of collaboration. In particular, CI research has focused on scientists' ability to document data collection and product development in ways that enable sharing and reuse of scientific results by enhancing results with provenance and other critical information.

The Center's crosscutting expertise is in collaboration and collaborative environments, semantic-based approaches to knowledge synthesis and representation (ontologies and provenance), and propagation of uncertainty in integrated analyses.  The subprojects through which this expertise will transcend are as follows:

(1) Knowledge Representation, Negotiation and Integration: Linking Human and Machine Knowledge Models through Semantics

(2) Advancing Understanding of Ecosystem Processes Using Cyberinfrastructure

(3) Integrated Analysis for Development of 3-D Models of Earth Structure

Cyber-ShARE's research in analysis of climate change impacts on the environment and the modeling of Earth's structure has advanced through the Center's interdisciplinary approaches supported by CI. Our environmental science group is advancing understanding of carbon flux in extreme desert and arctic environments through innovative multi-scale data collection and analysis, along with novel methods for minimizing error propagation and ensuring data quality.  Our geophysics research group is developing more accurate models of the Rio Grande Rift System through computational approaches to data integration and model fusion. The Center has developed novel tools that allow researchers to more effectively analyze the large amounts of data being collected through environmental and seismic sensor networks in these projects and around our nation.  Sensor data are critical for understanding short and long term global change, enabling better understanding of the effects of climate change on water and energy, and the effects of earth structure on earthquake risk. 

In the next phase of funding, the Cyber-ShARE Center will continue to conduct innovative, synergistic STEM research supported by CI in the areas of environmental science and geosciences.  Among a large number of research questions to be investigated as part of the three subprojects are the following:  

How can we create a machine understandable representation of individual mental models and integrated conceptual frameworks for interdisciplinary research, facilitated by advanced cyber-infrastructure?

What factors control land-atmosphere exchange of carbon, water and energy in desert and arctic terrestrial ecosystems and over what spatial and time scales?

How can Semantic Web technologies be used to enhance open access environmental data sharing, discovery, retrieval, integration, analysis, and visualization?

What is the evolution of the Rio Grande Rift and how does this relate to other active rifts, for example, the East Africa Rift System?

Can scientists understand, believe and accept new insights in the tectonic evolution of the southwest (and other regions) that were produced through the development of CI and CI-based applications that can seamlessly integrate and optimally fuse existing information sources?

The Center is critical to broadening training and education of interdisciplinary, CI-knowledgeable citizens, including STEM students who receive advanced degrees and represent the 21st century demographics.  Compared to the national averages for graduate students in geology and environmental and computer science (NSF 2008), Cyber-ShARE students are 82.7% Hispanic while the national average is 4.7%, and 36.5% female while the national average is 30.8%. The Center aims to reach even higher levels of involvement of citizens from underrepresented groups during Phase II. The Center will extend the network of Cyber-ShARE collaborations to include other major CI projects, international collaborators, and industry partners.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT EL PASO,ADMIN BLDG RM 209,El Paso,US,El Paso,TX16,University of Texas at El Paso,TX,799680001,47.076,"['Aaron  Velasco', 'Deana  Pennington', 'Craig E Tweedie', 'Natalia  Villanueva Rosales']",08/23/2012,132051285,4999439,08/31/2019,4900,CENTERS FOR RSCH EXCELL IN S&T,5099436,1242122,042000273,Ann Q Gates,,,US,El Paso,TX16,University of Texas at El Paso,TX,799680001,agates@utep.edu,Ann,Gates,Q,9157477689,vsantiag@nsf.gov,Victor A.

57,"This award supports the dissertation research project of Alix Johnson, PhD candidate at the University of California Santa Cruz.  Ms. Johnson's research investigates how the increase in private and public investment in global information infrastructure in Iceland affects social-cultural, economic, and governance systems, as well as national identity.  Information technology and trade is often proposed as a solution to the economic challenges of many rural Artic communities.  This research has the potential to inform other Arctic communities about the societal impacts of information technology as an approach to economic self-sufficiency in the north. 
 
This research project examines a range of ongoing efforts by private and public entities to make Iceland an ""information haven"" - an attractive location for storing data from around the world. By building data centers, founding start-ups, and passing ""information-friendly"" legislation, Icelanders hope to carve out a national niche and attract global data to Icelandic infrastructure. The project will explore how the development of this new infrastructure is changing local Icelandic livelihoods and senses of national identity.  Juxtaposing the globalization of information with nationalism and sovereignty, identity and place-making is a new look at these processes in the Arctic, processes that Arctic communities will see more of in the coming decades.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SANTA CRUZ",1156 High Street,Santa Cruz,US,Santa Cruz,CA20,University of California-Santa Cruz,CA,950641077,47.050,['Alix  Johnson'],01/28/2015,125084723,30240,01/31/2017,4900,ARCTIC SOCIAL SCIENCES,30240,1418268,071549000,Lisa  Rofel,,,US,Santa Cruz,CA20,University of California-Santa Cruz,CA,950641077,lrofel@cats.ucsc.edu,Lisa,Rofel,,4084593615,akerttul@nsf.gov,Anna Kerttula de Echave,7032927432,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The aim of this project was to map the impacts of information infrastructures (for example, data centers, internet exchanges, and fiber-optic cables).  Though such networks are often described as immediate and immaterial, this research proposed that data transfer and storage actually have significant social, political, and ecological effects.  Such impacts were investigated through fourteen months of ethnographic research (interviews and participant observation) in Reykjav&iacute;k and Reykjanes, Iceland.  A current hot spot for data center siting, doing research in Iceland offered an opportunity to study infrastructural development in motion, and investigate how it was promoted and perceived.

The research found, first, that today?s information infrastructures are often tied to those that came before.  For example, in Iceland, data centers are being developed in the footprint of a former U.S. military base.  These infrastructural inheritances influence the shape that present networks can take: that is, some our most techno-utopian futures are entangled with the architecture of past hopes and dreams.  Second, the research found that Iceland occupies a special position as an intermediary in networks between the U.S. and Europe (a role it also reprises from its time as a military base).  This position has been profitable for data center developers, but often excludes Icelanders themselves, most of whom do not benefit from being on the way.  In fact, the research found that Iceland is often exploited in its middle position: as a cultural imaginary, as an industry outpost, and as a hinge between ""green"" industry and anthropogenic global warming.  As such, this project questions the concept of ""connectivity,"" often imagined (at least since the European Enlightenment) as an inherent good.  Instead, the project illustrates some ambiguous effects of technological connection.  In doing so, it invites industry actors as well as individuals to reflect on our own habits of data consumption, showing how they play a pivotal role in the making and changing of place.  

Findings from this project are compiled in the dissertation: ""Compromising Connections: Icelandic Information Infrastructure and the Making of Marginality.""  This research has also been presented at international conferences, published online, and will be submitted as journal articles for peer review.

58,"The diversity of data and data types in the geosciences and their dispersal among various academic institutions and federal agencies, all of which have their own data formats and associated search and discovery criteria have prevented maximum effective utilization of this tremendous wealth of information.  To ameliorate this situation, a new NSF initiative, called EarthCube, which is jointly funded by the Directorate of Geosciences and the Office of Cyberinfrastructure, was initiated in 2011 to create an interoperable and integrated data and knowledge management for the geo- and environmental sciences.  An integral part of the process is geoscience and cyberinfrastructure community engagement, at all levels, to ensure that EarthCube's final design and implementation serves all end user needs.  Crucial to the success of EarthCube is its ability to serve the future needs of geoscientists and its ability to scale to new developments in computer science and technology.  To enable input from early career geo-and cyber scientists, a workshop, focused on the expected career trajectory of early career scientists likely to be end users and infrastructure developers, has been funded to examine their needs and to project into the future how these early career professionals envision how EarthCube will impact their science and career trajectories.  The workshop is being held at the Carnegie Institution of Washington.  It is being hosted by a diverse team of convenors and is focused on collecting input from this crucial early career demographic.  The two-day workshop will involve participants from 41 different disciplines within the geo and cyber sciences from around the US.

The participants were mostly assistant professors, but post docs, doctoral students, and a few others engaged in a highly interactive process of mapping their own career aspirations and considering how a robust cyber infrastructure might enable them to tackle high impact research questions and deliver education in new ways.   All of the individuals invited to the workshop were selected based on their being seen as emerging leaders in their respective domains, which included the following domains at the NSF:  AGS, BIO, CISE, EAR, HER, ENG, HER, OCE, OCI, OPP, and SBE.

Motivating the workshop was the new NSF initiative entitled ""EarthCube,"" which is a ten-year initiative designed to create a knowledge management system and infrastructure that integrates all geosciences data in an open, transparent and inclusive manner.  The overarching motivation was to understand how the research and educational trajectories of next generation leaders in the geosciences, computer sciences, and other relevant fields would map onto the future direction and potential for EarthCube.  In particular, four goals for the workshop were identified:

Map EarthCube onto Career Trajectories
Contribute to EarthCube Vision
Inform EarthCube Governance

Novel hybrid materials result when nanoparticles are dispersed in a matrix.  How the nanoparticles are arranged in the matrix critically affects the properties and the performance of the resulting hybrid materials.  Most current work in this field is in a ""discovery"" mode: one starts with a given nanoparticle building block (NBB), and then uses theory/simulation to model the processing steps to create the NBB assemblies and compute their properties.  While this discovery mode is useful for understanding experimental results a-posteriori, the real interest is in a-priori designing NBB that can assemble into functional structures with pre-determined properties.  The structures may develop under ""equilibrium"" or may be frozen in structures that can be tuned through the use of appropriate processing, e.g., through the application of strong flow fields such as in an extruder.  Currently, this ""reverse"" or design goal is only achieved in a trial-and-error manner. 

Intellectual Merit

This project has two overarching themes: First, a cyber-infrastructure will be developed to realize the goal of a-priori NBB design. A crucial difficulty in this context is that such a design process requires expertise in both materials science and scientific computing/software engineering, e.g., to properly model the NBBs, integrate various pieces of software, and parallelize critical components to run on specialized computer architectures, such as graphical processing units (GPUs).  Such broad-based capabilities are out of reach of most current practitioners.  To circumvent this difficulty, the second interrelated goal of this work is to develop model-integrated computing (MIC) based tools, so that the computational design of materials can be decoupled from the design and implementation of simulation-based experiments.  The project is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor because it attempts to abstract the deep human expertise currently required for the development of such simulation-based experiments. 

Broader Impact

The research effort will enrich and complement innovative educational and outreach activities.  In particular, an annual Computational ""cyber camp"" will be conducted, in which all students (undergraduates and graduates), post-docs and faculty funded by this grant, and external collaborators will participate.  Partnerships with HBCU institutions will allow for recruiting minority REU students, who can spend time at the cyber camp, with the ultimate goal of recruitment and retention.",NSF,4900,"VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY, THE",Sponsored Programs Administratio,Nashville,US,Nashville,TN05,Vanderbilt University,TN,372350002,47.041,['Akos  Ledeczi'],09/22/2010,965717143,1230000,09/30/2016,4900,CDI TYPE II,1230000,1028374,004413456,Peter T Cummings,Sponsored Programs Administratio,Nashville,US,Nashville,TN05,Vanderbilt University,TN,372350002,peter.cummings@vanderbilt.edu,Peter,Cummings,T,6153228129,tmountzi@nsf.gov,Triantafillos Mountziaris,7032924641,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"In this project, we developed a software infrastructure to enable us to calculate reliably the properties of nanoparticle assemblies. The project involved a unique synergistic collaboration between chemical engineering researchers, with world-class expertise in molecular simulation and computational nanoscience, and computer scientists, with world-class expertise in software engineering, particularly the paradigm of model integrated computing. The nanoparticles studied consist of a core nanoparticle - which could be a metal nanoparticle or an inorganic nanoparticle (such as silica, SiO2) - to which is attached (or tethered) organic molecules such as hydrocarbon chains. The nature of the core nanoparticle, and the length, number, and placement of the tethered chains on the core nanoparticle, and the solvent in which they are dispersed, all influence how the tethered nanoparticles assemble into functional structures. Our goal was to be able to predict routinely and quickly the properties of assemblies of these tethered nanoparticles, so that we could then perform molecular-level design (by varying all of the nanoparticle and solvent properties) to optimize the performance of the assemblies for specific applications. During the course of this project, we achieved the first step in this process - i.e., developing a computational framework for the efficient, routine calculation of tethered nanoparticle assemblies - laying the groundwork for future studies that optimize the tethered nanoparticle/solvent systems. Screening of nanoparticles as a function of grafting density and length have also been performed using molecular simulation and theoretical modeling, to establish general trends in the aggregation versus dispersion behavior, in both vacuum and common solvents.  5 papers were published as a part of this work and the software framework used as part of several simulation workshops.  Several graduate students (two M.S., one PhD) were supported by this grant.  

 
The spatial organization of nanoparticles in matrices is of great interest since it critically affects the properties of the resulting hybrid materials. Most current work in this field is in a ""discovery"" mode: one starts with a given nanoparticle building block (NBB), and then uses theory/simulation to predict the properties of the NBB assemblies. While this discovery (or ""forward"") mode is useful for understanding experimental results a posteriori, the real interest is in a priori designing NBB that can assemble into functional structures with desired properties. Currently, this ""reverse"" or design goal is currently only achieved in an Edisonian manner. The intellectual merit of the research in this project is the development of a transformative cyber-infrastructure that, in the future, will allow us to realize the goal of designing NBB that result in nanoparticle assemblies with specific properties. 

 
The broader impact of the research in this project is the development of a methodology for molecular design that can be translated to other fields of molecular design. In addition, three graduate students (two female, one male) were trained in the field of computational materials sciences. In particular, the PhD student trained in this project, Jessica Haley, is an African-American female who has become a strong advocate for minority and female participation in STEM fields. She is currently employed as a Senior Chemical Engineer at ExxonMobil in Houston, TX.

Proposal Number:	EPS-1006891
Institution:	Louisiana Board of Regents
Project Director:	Michael M. Khonsari

This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). 

The Louisiana Optical Network Initiative (LONI) provides a modern, robust cyberinfrastructure environment that enhances research, fosters and facilitates cross-disciplinary collaborations, and integrates research and education across Louisiana. Currently, LONI provides network connectivity to virtually every public institution of higher education in Louisiana, as well as four research universities in the state of Mississippi. This proposal requests funding to extend LONI's high-bandwidth optical network into Xavier University of Louisiana located in New Orleans. Xavier is a private, historically-black university, which is nationally recognized for its science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) curriculum. This major initiative is expected to close the cyberinfrastructure gap at Xavier and facilitate active research relationships between Xavier faculty and students and the State's leading computational and experimental scientists as well as partnerships with major institutions nationally. Through this program, Xavier would become the first Louisiana institution whose research activities are anchored in a primarily undergraduate curriculum that is linked into LONI at a bandwidth that takes full advantages of the optical network's capabilities.

Intellectual Merit
By providing a high-bandwidth network gateway to collaborators and mentors across the State and the nation, this proposal to extend and link LONI into the Xavier University campus promises to enhance fundamental research and education in many different ways. Focusing on collaborative research projects that are already underway at Xavier in the broad arena of materials science, the enhanced cyber-infrastructure environment plans to support: (1) studies of molecular magnetism to aid in the design of higher-performance magnets to enhance the capabilities of, for example, high-density information recording media; (2) research on novel materials for energy conversion and
spintronics applications; (3) molecular dynamics simulations of the interaction energies between surfactant molecules and the crystal planes of nanoparticles; (4) numerical modeling efforts aimed at reducing the time required to engineer nanofluidic devices used to identify molecular signatures and thereby aid a variety of applications in biological discovery; (5) research aimed at eliminating pinholes during the fabrication of thin-film batteries; and (6) the investigation of polymorphism in pharmaceutically active organic crystals. 
This Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) Cyber-Connectivity (C2) project proposes to build on the State's investments in cutting-edge cyberinfrastructure by closing the cyberinfrastructure gap at Xavier University of Louisiana, providing broadband connectivity equivalent to that of major research institutions in the State. These investments would accelerate learning and discovery at a nationally recognized HBCU, allowing Xavier's faculty and staff to be fully integrated into statewide interdisciplinary research collaborations. Through curricular enhancements, undergraduate research, and high performance computing training, Xavier's students will be better prepared for graduate school and life-long careers in computational and materials science fields.

Broader Impacts
This project would impact research and education, diversity, and workforce development in the State in the following ways:
RII C2-enabled Research and Education: Through Xavier's connection to LONI, underrepresented undergraduate students would receive enhanced research and educational opportunities, which will better prepare them for success in graduate school. LA RII C2 leverages Xavier's 3+2 engineering program as well as its new materials science research and education program by adding computational content to courses currently under development. The Computer Science department would develop new courses in data mining, robotics, and an interdisciplinary course in bioinformatics. Ten undergraduate students would participate in academic year and summer research projects in computer sciences and computational materials fields, with the opportunity to be mentored by faculty members at Xavier and other institutions participating in the EPSCoR RII Track 1 program. In addition, faculty and students would receive training in high performance computing from both LONI staff members and through attending workshops at national supercomputing centers.

Diversity: During the past decade, Xavier has ranked first nationally in the number of African American students earning undergraduate degrees in biology, chemistry, and physics, and in the physical sciences overall. Xavier currently ranks eighth in the nation in the number of its STEM majors who go on to earn their doctorates in science and engineering fields. Access to LONI would increase the research capacity at Xavier and would increase the number of underrepresented minority students engaged in high performance computing in the State. It would integrate Xavier's faculty and students more fully into the collaborative research and educational projects currently offered by the Louisiana EPSCoR program.

Workforce Development: Louisiana needs to more fully utilize its African American population (32% of its inhabitants) in its advanced technology workforce. Xavier is uniquely positioned to aid in this effort to produce leaders to meet the current and future demands for science and engineering professionals. Through the research opportunities, curriculum enhancements, and high performance computing training Xavier's undergraduate students would be better trained for graduate school and lifelong careers in STEM fields.",NSF,4900,LOUISIANA BOARD OF REGENTS,1201 N.

Funding from the NSF Research Infrastructure Improvement Intra-campus and Inter-campus Cyber Connectivity (RII C2) program has allowed Xavier University of Louisiana, a private historically-black university nationally recognized for its STEM curriculum, to connect to LONI, a modern, robust cyberinfrastructure environment that enhances research, fosters and facilitates cross-disciplinary collaborations, and integrates research and education across Louisiana. Through this funding, Xavier has developed HPC expertise for both faculty and students through a cadre of research and educational programs.  
 
Cyberinfrastructure Improvements
The LONI connection doubled bandwidth at the University from 250 mbps to 500 mbps.  Internet access is currently divided into two circuits, one faculty and staff and one for the residence halls. The faculty and staff network was increased from 150 mpbs to 200 mbps and the student network was increased from 100 mbps to 300 mbps.  Additionally, faculty are able to conduct research via LONI at a speed of 10 gbps, providing them with grid computing capabilities, increased data storage and transfer, and modeling/simulation and visualization capabilities.
 
Intellectual Merit
XavierÆs faculty and students have forged active research relationships with computational researchers throughout the State in bioinformatics, physics, mathematics, and materials science research. This has been accomplished through externally funded collaborative research projects, workshops featuring regional computational experts, and pilot research projects.  The Pilot Funding for Collaborative Computational Research program funded three faculty members, including Dr. Jessica Graber (Physics), Dr. Lamar Meda (Chemistry), and Dr. Jian Zhang (Chemistry), who each received $34,000 to utilize LONIÆs high performance computing resources and collaborate with another Louisiana institution. Lamar Meda collaborated with researchers from Louisiana Tech University to study the results of designed materials with improved properties and the structure of materials using computational/experimental outputs. Jian Zhang collaborated with researchers from Southern University to study gas sensing properties of tin oxide nanoparticles using methanol and ethanol. Jessica Graber collaborated with researchers from Tulane University to study the nature of rogue waves. Now that Xavier is fully connected to LONI, the new cyberinfrastructure environment will allow XavierÆs researchers to continue building active research relationships with the StateÆs leading computational and experimental scientists as well as partnerships with major institutions nationally. 
 
Broader Impacts
Through RII C2 funding, XavierÆs underrepresented undergraduate students are receiving enhanced research and educational opportunities that will better prepare them for success in graduate school. Three new Computer Science courses have been developed and existing courses are being modified and enhanced by computational content. Over the lifetime of the grant, this project has supported 42 undergraduate student research projects in the fields of Computer Science, Chemistry, and Physics. In addition, over 50 of XavierÆs faculty and students have attended on-campus seminars on computational topics and multiple faculty and students have attended national and regional HPC computing training sessions. A total of 8 of these students have graduated to date.  Four of these students have matriculated into graduate school and four have joined the STEM workforce.  NSF studies have shown that involving freshman and sophomore students in research increases the likelihood of them becoming STEM majors, while involving students in research at the junior/senior levels increases the likelihood of their continuing their education at the graduate level. We expect that the remaining students engaged in this project will choose to go on to graduate school, thereby creating a pipeline of well-quali...",,"['W. Zhang, A. Edwards, W.

This non-research award provides four years of U.S. support for membership in the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF), a multilateral organization headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden.  INCF is a coordinated, international scientific effort to create a portal for navigation and integration of distributed resources within different domains of neurosciences. Thirteen nations so far (Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States) and the European Commission are members.  The new services provided by INCF will contribute to improved access and integration of data and transfer of knowledge between levels of organization, and a more rapid development of realistic models of brain functions.  INCF's Neuroinformation Community Portal will provide an interoperable network of neuroscience databases and related software tools.  In addition, INCF will offer tested and validated work flows, with defined inputs and outputs, and tutorials and instructions for making use of such work flows for data analysis. The initial four years will concentrate on large-scale modeling of the nervous system, mouse and rat brain digital atlasing, integration of fMRI data resource, and neuroanotomical nomenclature and taxonomy.   

Broader Impacts:  Brain and nervous system studies for the long-term benefit of society require integration of heterogeneous and complex data collected at multiple levels of investigation.  That capability is provided by INCF, a critical global network to advance knowledge and understanding of basic brain functions, devastating diseases of the nervous system, and neural processing as applied to information sciences and development of artificial systems.  The INCF is a novel, internationally-funded infrastructure taking advantage of multiple levels of expertise in neuroinformatics - across boundaries, scientific domains, private and public sectors, methodologies and approaches.",NSF,4900,KAROLINSKA INST,Nobels Vaeg 5,Stockholm,SW,,,Karolinska Institutet,,171 77,47.079,"['Sten  Grillner', 'Jeanette  Hellgren Kotaleski']",09/18/2007,350582235,,09/30/2011,4900,ICSU,1400000,0733492,350582235,Sten  Grillner,Nobels Vaeg 5,Stockholm,SW,,,Karolinska Institutet,,171 77,Sten.Grillner@ki.se,Sten,Grillner,,0852486593,@nsf.gov,,,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"""The International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility: Cyber-infrastructure for Global Neuroinformatics""

The project ""The International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility: Cyber-infrastructure for Global Neuroinformatics"" is an international initiative to facilitate neuroinformatics data sharing and to solve challenges in standardization and interoperability. The INCF was founded in 2005 and has currently 16 member countries (Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Switzerland, Sweden, Republic of Korea, UK and US).

During the NSF granting period 2007-2011, the INCF has made a marked progress in its core mission to coordinate collaborative neuroinformatics infrastructure and promote the sharing of data and computing resources to the international research community.

The INCF works through its four scientific programs, which represent long-term strategic undertakings to address issues of high importance to the neuroscience community:

&gt; Digital Brain Atlasing (DBA) &ndash; coordinates and improves the impact of brain atlasing projects. One main outcome is the ""Waxholm Space"", a coordinate-based reference space for the mapping and registration of neuroanatomical data in the mouse brain.

&gt; Multiscale Modeling (MSM) &ndash; improves interoperability and reproducibility of neural simulations. Main deliverables are NineML, a simulator independent description language for network models, and the Multi-Simulating Coordinator, MUSIC, a standard interface for run-time exchange of data among parallel applications in a cluster environment.

&gt; Ontologies for Neural Structures (PONS) &ndash; establishes consistent names for all neural structures. The program has together with the Neuroinformatics Framework, NIF, developed the joint project NeuroLex.org, a freely editable semantic wiki for community-based curation of the terms used in Neuroscience.

&gt; Standards for Datasharing (DASH) &ndash; facilitates the recording, sharing and reporting of metadata. The program is the youngest of the INCF programs, and is initially focused on developing a one-click share tool and a common API for sharing neuroimaging data.

The INCF has also initiated a teaching and training committee, to develop best practices in neuroinformatics training and to facilitate international cooperation around courses and training materials.

In order to realize the goals of the INCF, an international infrastructure for neuroscience data sharing and integration is being developed. This initiative will provide a platform for international neuroscience data publishing and access. The INCF member countries support this initiative and provide the driving use cases.

The results and ongoing efforts of the INCF is communicated through the INCF web portal incf.org, where the different INCF reports are available, and through the annual INCF Neuroinformatics Congress (which was held in Boston, US, in 2011). INCF also has a website dedicated to neuroscience software tools, software.incf.org.

Title: Workshop on Cyber Infrastructure in Chemical and Biological Systems: Impact and Directions

PROJECT SUMMARY

The objectives of the workshop are to (1) identify and exemplify major application impacts, directions and the potential for Cyber Infrastructure (CI) as it pertains to Chemical and Biological Systems, (2) identify and recommend research areas that aim toward the fulfillment of this potential, and (3) identify associated areas of needed emphasis with CI infrastructure, education and training, interdisciplinary development, and support and approaches to collaboration.

INTELLECTUAL MERIT

The workshop will encompass chemical and biological processes, systems biology, pharmaceuticals and metabolic engineering and involve energy, environmental, nano- and bioscience perspectives in the process context.  The thematic area will be generally defined by industries, applications, processes and systems primarily characterized by chemical and biological transformations and material, energy and information flows.

The workshop will bring together research and industrial communities in chemical and biological systems involved in smart plant technologies, supply chain management, product and production design and optimization, process management and control, simulation and modeling and data analysis with the CI infrastructure planning and operational community.  It will draw upon top talent from a diverse set of disciplinary areas as well as academic, laboratory, operations, and industrial viewpoints while maintaining the theme of ""chemical and biological systems.""  The workshop anticipates research and practice leaders in simulation, multi-scale modeling, optimization, design, dynamics and control, sensing and interfaces, wide area data aggregation, large scale/wide area data management, analysis and visualization and network science.

BROAD IMPACT

The workshop will foster collaboration across several key dimensions of the CI and chemical and biological systems combination.  These dimensions include technique and technical integration, academic and industry, infrastructure and application, current and future directions for CI, and current and future economic potential for CI. The workshop will look across a broad diversity of computation and networked-based technologies to make recommendations to NSF on future research directions and it will exemplify for the process and systems communities, the value of and their role in investing in CI and CI-enabled research.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES","11000 Kinross Avenue, Suite 211",LOS ANGELES,US,Los Angeles,CA33,University of California-Los Angeles,CA,900952000,47.041,,09/05/2006,092530369,76450,04/30/2007,4900,PROCESS & REACTION ENGINEERING,61450,0645024,071549000,James F Davis,"11000 Kinross Avenue, Suite 211",LOS ANGELES,US,Los Angeles,CA33,University of California-Los Angeles,CA,900952000,jdavis@oit.ucla.edu,James,Davis,F,3102060011,mburka@nsf.gov,Maria Burka,7032927030,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,,09/15/2006,"Workshop on Cyber Infrastructure in Chemical and Biological Systems: Impact and Directions to be held September 25-26, 2006",Grant
63,"Cybersecurity is threatened by the zero-day exploits (software vulnerabilities that have not been previously disclosed and are therefore potential vectors for attack). The threat is serious for exploits in the hands of major cyber powers that are potentially hostile nations. Publication of a zero-day exploits can enhance the resilience of domestic cyber-infrastructure (if an adversary has discovered the same exploit), and it could give other countries the opportunity to patch their systems proactively, increasing confidence that they will not be penetrated. Communicating zero-day exploits, however, has the obvious drawback that the exploit loses value as a weapon, because countries could patch their own systems to resist it. Thus, the cost of publication is the loss of such exploits for use in deterrence and/or future offensive cyber operations. U.S. policy has recently begun to address the question of which zero-day exploits known to the government should be published, both to enhance national security and to instill confidence by others. The project analyzes various costs and benefits of publishing exploits or patches, and studies how the costs might be mitigated whether through policy or technical means. 

In a new collaboration, computer scientist, Stephanie Forrest, and political scientist, Robert Axelrod, are developing integrated approaches to the rapidly expanding problem of cyber conflict, combining historical analysis, technical research, strategic analysis, and computational modeling.  This project focuses on three areas where U.S.  policy could provide additional leadership in cyberspace: publication of zero-day exploits; labeling of neutral infrastructure, such as networks associated with hospitals or religious sites, and shared norms to protect neutral cyberspaces; and sustainment of Internet interoperability, which allows Internet users on different networks to communicate directly without interference. The  findings may benefit national security by giving policymakers a way of assessing the costs and benefits of publishing exploits or patches. This project injects a fresh and timely voice into debates about the cyberagenda, suggesting concrete measures for minimizing the likelihood and impacts of conflict among state actors.",NSF,4900,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3003 South State St. Room 1062,Ann Arbor,US,Ann Arbor,MI12,University of Michigan Ann Arbor,MI,481091274,47.075,,08/20/2014,073133571,98546,08/31/2017,4900,Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace,98546,1444500,073133571,Robert  Axelrod,,Ann Arbor,US,Ann Arbor,MI12,University of Michigan Ann Arbor,MI,481091274,axe@umich.edu,Robert,Axelrod,,7347630099,skiesler@nsf.gov,Sara Kiesler,7032928760,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The major goal is to reduce the risk of cyber conflict, including among both state and non-state actors. We are incorporating social, economic, organizational, and political considerations, which are often pursued in isolation from technical reality.

We focused on the problem of attribution of cyberattacks, where the target typically faces a strategic choice based on both its ability to attribute the attack to a specific perpetrator and whether it has an appropriate punishment. We developed a game theory model, called The Blame Game, that captures the interplay between the technical ability to trace back an attack to its orgin and broader strategic concerns. In our model, the best strategic choice for the victim depends on the vulnerability of the attacker, the knowledgabilty of the victim, as well as the payoffs for different outcomes, and Bayesian priors of each player about the other player. The resulting Blame Game allows analysis of four policy relevant questions: the conditions under which cooperation (i.e. no attacks) is stable, when attacks are tolerated, the consequences of asymmetric capabilities for technical attribution, and when a third part or an accident can undermine cooperation. In addition to developing the game, and conducting the analysis, we investigated relevant historical examples to illustrate the theory in the context of not only cyber conflict, but also kinetic conflict, and crisis management. The historical examples involve the United States, Russia, China, Japan, North Korea, Estonia, Israel, Iran, and Syria.

We identified four aspects of cyber attribution that complicate the attribution problem. (1) Technology isn't politics, (2) Attribution can be spoofed, (3) Incentive to exaggerate and (4) Lack of appropriate response.

Key outcomes or Other achievements: Published paper in PNAS describing the Blame Game and its analysis.

64,"Patients visiting health care providers have to repeat their medical history several times and have to wait for extended periods of time before they get service even if their records are stored in electronic medical records (EMR). In the case of elderly or disabled patients, or trauma patients; unless they have their medication written, it is hard to know about all their prescriptions and preexisting conditions. For patients facing trauma the medical care providers do not know the existing conditions, allergies of the patient or other underline critical conditions e.g. diabetes, cancer etc. In current EMR, it is difficult to grasp all the crucial issues in a short time (3-5 minutes. While most states require electronic communication of this data to their state repositories, the communication between the pre-hospital environment remains a significant challenge. There are currently no other standard solutions in the market that provide effective integration of existing data within the hospital environment and different institutions.

This team has developed the proof of concept of the Cyber Infrastructure Medical Visual Interface (CI-MVI) technology that would directly reduce the response time during clinical visit, and save lives of trauma patients.  The Cyber Infrastructure Medical Visual Interface (CI-MVI) is a tool that enables health care providers with rapidly comprehensible, easy to read/access (via touch screen), crucial health parameters so that treatment plans could be designed in a timely manner. Repetitive processes, especially with regards to information collection have been identified and tasked to the cyber infrastructure, while providing an interactive graphical visual interface (GUI) to the health care providers. Ultimately the goal is to form an extensive cloud database that is accessible from any smart phone, I-Pad or computers. The CI-MVI will be further augmented with the capability of communicating with various health monitoring systems including Electronic Medical Records (EMR) to give the instantaneous state of health including locations outside of the USA since information is stored and accessed on a cloud based computing system.",NSF,4900,TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY SYSTEM,349 Administration Bldg,Lubbock,US,Lubbock,TX19,Texas Tech University,TX,794091035,47.041,,04/14/2015,041367053,50000,09/30/2016,4900,I-Corps,50000,1536208,041367053,Luciano  Castillo,,,US,Lubbock,TX19,Texas Tech University,TX,794091035,LCastillo@purdue.edu,Luciano,Castillo,,7654944000,skonsek@nsf.gov,Steven Konsek,7032927021,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Project Summary

During 2015 cohort our team conducted over 100 interviews and after a detailed conversation with many customers we learned that we still need further investigation of our customer market. Thus, our decision at that time was a no-go, however; after the program we continued talking with more customers. Our team learned that patients with pre-existing conditions and elderlies will benefit from our technology. This was completely opposite to our initial hypothesis that Medical Doctors will be our primary customer segment for our product. The main reason why this did not quite work the way we expected is because administrators at hospitals are more concerned about compliance with electronic medical records and not necessarily providing a new technology for doctors and patients. Consequently, rather than developing further our product we decided that creating a product driven by patients needs was more valuable to market. 

Outcomes:
Our team conducted total 100 interviews (92 face to face, 4 Skype, 4 phone) to test the initial hypothesis of developing an interactive visual interface for Doctors and Nurses that will reduce the data input time for each patient and enable focus on quality care. The interviews were conducted across a broad range of customer segments. Doctors, nurses, hospital management, EMR developers, adult patients, parents of pediatric patients etc. were interviewed. Figure 1 shows a map of locations where the interviews were conducted. In addition to mainland US a few stations in Europe were also visited for interviews. This was possible since a pre-organized conference was on schedule in during the time of customer discovery.



Reduce time to update health records: The time taken to update EMR was found to be the central issue causing burnout in doctors. Both experienced and old doctors and young doctors found it intrusive to practice and reduced time given to the patient. Most of the time was consumed in documenting the issues. Some hospitals hired 'scribes' to input the information in the EMR. The tool developed was found to be somewhat useful.

Assure compliance, reduce malpractice insurance: It was found that the hospitals would prefer a document trail to avoid lawsuit issues in future. However, this came at great cost of doctor's time. One of the conveniences of the EMR is that the billing process could be automated. However, given the number of codes for medical problems the EMR acts as an electronic archival tool,  does not improve visit efficiency significantly. The innovation is not related to the issue however a closer look revealed an ecosystem.In the course of the interviews with EMR professionals and hospital management it was revealed that the hospital management is motivated to maintain an EMR as envisioned by the government and receive a compliance bonus or funding. The EMR characteristics are not necessarily useful for patients or doctors who are the end users of the system. Further, the hospitals will not receive payments from government programs such as medicare etc. if the EMR does not match the requirement of the government. 


In this scenario the hospital IT struggles to achieve the incremental guidelines (meaningful use stage (MU)) of EMR requirements. The user experience is not a priority. However, this dynamic revealed that the CIMVI is not of much use to hospitals as EMR replacement, since, well established EMR's although inconvenient are designed to meet certain requirement.  The utility of visual interface is of incremental, non urgent value to hospital management. Due these issues the CIMVI team decided to pivot to other niche areas.

65,"A cyber-learning tool was developed to enable the integration of campus sustainability projects into a wide variety of classes as relevant, experiential learning sites. The broad goal of this endeavor is to engage undergraduate students in order to help them develop the STEM related skills needed in the 21st Century. The goal of this project is to develop, pilot and assess a framework that can be employed as a step towards future use at other universities. The framework includes the cyber-learning infrastructure for campus sustainability (CLICS), as well as examples of how these data can be used in project-based learning experiences, and an agenda for training instructors to design experiential learning modules using such a tool in their own classes. Assessment and evaluation provides preliminary evidence that the approach engages students and helps them excel in 21st century STEM skills. The development and assessment of a framework for cyber-infrastructure tools and training to help bring the value of CLICS into the classroom represents the primary intellectual merit of this project. CLICS includes specifications for sensors, data acquisition and a schematic-based open-source graphical interface to enable easy user access and interpretation.  Eleven faculty members are trained to use CLICS in their classrooms, impacting over 300 students per year.  Many classes that do address sustainability issues have a relatively high percentage of female students.  Thus, this project disproportionately supports gender diversity in STEM classes.",NSF,4900,CLARKSON UNIVERSITY,8 Clarkson Avenue,Potsdam,US,Potsdam,NY21,Clarkson University,NY,136761401,47.076,"['Stefan J Grimberg', 'Jan E DeWaters', 'Daqing  Hou']",01/18/2013,041590993,200000,01/31/2016,4900,TUES-Type 1 Project,200000,1245622,041590993,Susan E Powers,8 Clarkson Ave,Potsdam,US,Potsdam,NY21,Clarkson University,NY,136761401,sep@clarkson.edu,Susan,Powers,E,3152686542,lzia@nsf.gov,Lee L. Zia,7032928670,040106 NSF Education & Human Resource,"CLICS (cyber-learning infrastructure for campus sustainability) is a cyber-learning tool developed to integrate data from campus sustainability projects into a form that can be used in a wide variety of classes for relevant, experiential learning opportunities. The broad goal of this endeavor is to engage undergraduate students in order for them to excel their competencies with 21st Century skills [1], including STEM content, sustainability literacy and critical thinking.

NSF TUES funding was used to develop CLICSÆ computational and educational framework, pilot the methods at Clarkson University and assess its impact on students. CLICS has been developed with data specific to ClarksonÆs integrated greenhouse and digester project.  This data-rich infrastructure provides a wealth of opportunities for understanding and evaluating engineered systems from diverse disciplines and perspectives. 

In the implementation of the CLICS interface and data into a variety of classroom experiences., our goal was to support instructors with the opportunity to use these real-world and relevant data to meet learning objectives in their particular class. The CLICS program provides:

training of instructors to understand the engineered systems and use of Mango;
project ideas;
development of basic report templates that can be used directly or adapted for studentsÆ data access needs; and,
tutorials and presentations for classes to help students understand the physical systems and data access procedures.


After the development and testing of the system over 4 semesters, CLICS was used in 17 classes reaching 830 students. Evaluation results indicated that over 70% of all students strongly agreed/agreed that the overall experience of using campus data was positive and recommended that CLICS should be used in other classes and all participating instructors indicated that they would continue to integrate place-based data into course assignments and would expand the use into different courses. 

Assessment of sustainability literacy and ctritical thinking attributes highlighted an intersting difference between students in engineering classes and students in math classes (who were also largely engineering majors).  The use of real-world data and data analysis in engineering classes resulted in higher scores on each of the three dimensions of sustainability literacy and the critical thinking rubric.  These differences could stem from the nature of the assignments in the different classes or the expectations that these types of real-world projects are an expected aspect of engineering classes, but not math classes.

Integrating project evaluation comments with the research team's observations, several key elements were identified are critical to the success of this type of project.  Given the constraints of our hardware and system infrastructure, a few of these issues could not be rectified:

Students responded well to the concept of using data from a system on campus.  The inclusion of a field trip to the site (which was feasible in smaller classes), help to provide students with an adequate understanding of the system they were studying.
Training is critical, but not sufficient for instructors.  Instructors must also actually engage in the project data acquisition and analysis they expected of their students to understand the system and work required to effectively teach their students 
Mango is not recommended into the future.  This open source software was selected to facilitate the expansion of this project to other universities.  However, even with the improvements made wt the graphical-based GUI and virtual data, the system was not sufficiently intuitive and easy to use in comparison to professional software and apps today's students expect.
Substantially more bandwidth to access the data server is required for education purposes compared with research purposes.

66,"The PIs are designing, deploying, and studying learning in the context of a visually-integrated cyber exploratorium for design -- an infrastructure for collaborative visual design activities. The project is being carried out in the context of an undergraduate innovative design course, and the investigative focus is on design of and learner capabilities when using interfaces and environments for expressing ideas in visual forms that capture explicit and tacit knowledge and that can be shared and the affordances for promoting learning of ideation and collaboration around such shared representations of knowledge. The technological innovation is a cyber-infrastructure hardware framework that includes touch tablets, walls, and a wiki combined with software for sketching and diagramming and the socio-technical system around it that enables the kinds of high-end collaborative ""play"" needed for innovative ideation. Research centers on promoting learning in design; promoting the cognition of ideation in a social learning environment; relationships between visual thinking, imagination, and externalization; and how such a technological framework transforms creation of design knowledge and learning. Foundations are in the constructivist theory of learning, the social constructivist view of social construction of knowledge, the design of natural user interfaces (NUIs), and the view that cognition is embodied in the artifacts and affordances of the environment. The PIs are taking an ecological approach to examining the environment to understand how its combination of factors influence design learning, specifically integrative visual thinking, collaboration, and innovation. 

Research has established the important role of exploratory ""play"" in the development of creativity and cognition and the central role of such exploration in ideation, especially in ideation of innovative solutions to problems and design challenges. This project leverages the possibilities inherent in natural user interfaces (NUIs) for promoting the kinds of collaborative exploration of ideas that is essential for collaborative learning, problem solving, and design. The hardware infrastructure being designed enables groups to articulate ideas visually, share them, and refine them together around a large collaborative multi-touch interface, to access those visualizations from afar and annotate them textually, and to share those ideas broadly with classmates, team-mates, and others. Such an infrastructure provides a foundation for supporting project-based and design-based learning activities in formal learning environments in ways that give all team members chances to contribute appropriately, record the contributions of team-mates for teachers and other mentors to examine, allow sharing and advice from peers, mentors, and experts, and eventually allow automatical assessment, help,and advice.

We introduced the concept of shared design ""notebooks"" in the form of tablet computers, and that of a shared ""wall"" in the form of a large display, that a team could use to discuss ideas with each other. 
 
Intellectual Merit
The V-ICED ecosystem provides computer support for collaborative ideation. We achieve this collaboration through a web-based framework where the work of each student is saved in a central repository, immediately accessible to their teammates. This work is also visually represented as a series of ""paths"", where each path &ndash; a collection of linked sketches &ndash; represents the development of an idea by one or more students. The web-based framework thus provides a means of collaboration as well as a visual representation of the development of  collaborative knowledge.
We demonstrated that our model of collaboration and its representation has tremendous value in terms of storing sketches as well as group awareness for the team. We also demonstrated that the use of the V-ICED framework improves collaborative dynamics, reflected by stronger conversational turns (reciprocity), speech overlaps (synchrony), and participation equity, leading to higher ideation fluency and collaboration quality within design teams.
 
For design researchers, this representation and storage of collaborative design sketching augments other forms of data typically collected in design research, such as video/audio recording of design sessions, and wearable sociometric sensors. We demonstrated that the representation of collaboration provided by the V-ICED framework data can enhance design researcher's understanding of the collaborative design process. To do this, we developed a visual analytics framework that integrates this representation of collaboration and combines it with other data such as audio, video, text transcript, and sociometric data, in order to aid the design analyst in understanding design team behavior.
 
Broader Impacts
Design is a ubiquitous activity in all product development, and every design process starts with an early and creative phase where ideas are generated, explored, elaborated, and multiplied. However, whereas prototyping, manufacturing, and even engineering are increasingly outsourced to foreign markets, innovative design remains one of the competitive edges of our nationÆs economy. In particular, there is a long-standing need to design scalable web-based collaborative sketching systems. The knowledge derived from the V-ICED project has impact for a particularly broad segment of disciplines beyond product design, including software engineering, business analytics and intelligence, and various scientific endeavors.

67,"The University of Wisconsin is awarded a grant to conduct planning for an institute to advance research in phenomics through the development of software and high-throughput computational methods for capturing and analyzing data on biological form and function. A major goal in biology research is to understand how an organism?s complement of genes (the genome) contributes to the appearance, growth, development, behavior, etc. of the organism (the phenotype). Much phenotype information can be captured in digital images of organisms undergoing growth and development at scales ranging from microscopic cells to whole plants in crop fields. The rapidly growing realization of how effectively image analysis can advance the study of genotype-to-phenotype relationships adds some urgency to the need for improved computational methods. Currently, research labs adopting this experimental approach are each creating their own custom cyber infrastructures for collecting and analyzing images to achieve the necessary degree of automation and throughput. This conceptualization project will bring biologists and computer scientists together to investigate the cyber infrastructure (CI) developments needed to facilitate image-based phenotype research. The ideas to explore can be cast into general questions. How can the computational aspects of phenotype research be made routine enough for a biology research group to use without continuous support of a computer science staff? Do different research contexts (e.g. primarily undergraduate or industrial campuses) require different solutions? What can be done to increase the number of research biologists naturally inclined and academically prepared to work at the computation/math/biology interface where phenotype research resides? Invited-participation workshops and open events at key conferences will be conducted to generate informed debate. A Steering Committee consisting of diversely experienced biologists and computer scientists headed by the PI and assisted by staff will orchestrate the activities and synthesize the findings into a public report that will include recommendations about how to create an effective and easy-to-use cyberinfrastructure that would advance this important area of biology research. Plant biology research will often be the example but any field that generates and analyzes large, high-dimensional datasets, of which stacks and layers of digital images are just one example, stands to benefit from this project. Another aspect that gives this project a broad impact is the emphasis on education and preparation of the next generation of biology researchers. Biology students in general must become better prepared for work at the biology/computation/math interface or even the very best CI will be utilized by only a narrow portion of the research community that stands to benefit from it.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SYSTEM,21 North Park Street,MADISON,US,Madison,WI02,University of Wisconsin-Madison,WI,537151218,47.070,"['Miron  Livny', 'Tessa L Durham Brooks']",08/29/2012,161202122,415601,08/31/2015,4900,Software Institutes,415601,1216869,041188822,Edgar P Spalding,,,US,Madison,WI02,University of Wisconsin-Madison,WI,537061381,spalding@wisc.edu,Edgar,Spalding,P,6082655294,dkatz@nsf.gov,Daniel Katz,7032922254,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Phenotype is a biological term that refers to the properties or characteristics of an organism. Phenotypes are the output of instructions encoded in DNA, the results of gene function. Plant phenotypes have been studied ever since humans began creating and selecting varieties of plants that best produced food and fiber materials. Reasons to study plant phenotypes now include achieving a better understanding of a particular geneÆs function, and improving a crop varietyÆs performance, i.e. to increase basic biological knowledge and improve agricultural products. In either case, basic or applied, researchers often measure how the phenotype varies between plants carrying different versions of the gene. The phenotype being measured may be seedling root growth rate or corn grain yield. A single study may require the phenotype be measured in thousands of genetically-distinct individuals to create statistically-significant relationships between variation in the genetic makeup, or genotype, and variation in the phenotype. In recent years, phenotype measuring methods have become more technologically sophisticated. Now electronic devices such as specialized digital cameras and software are being used to measure phenotypes in a high-throughput fashion. The goal of this project was to determine how a promising new way to study phenotypes that relies on cyber infrastructure could be improved. Cyber infrastructure refers to the combination of software, computing hardware, methods, and even personnel required to achieve complicated tasks. We engaged the community of plant phenotype researchers to learn about the cyber infrastructure being created to conduct technology-enabled, high-throughput plant phenotype research, especially to learn about the bottlenecks.

The picture attached to this report summarizes a paradigm to which we found most plant phenotyping projects could be fit. This generalization helps to understand what limits progress and therefore helps to frame solutions. We found evidence that some research groups were having difficulty at the data acquisition stage, with tasks such as capturing images containing information from sufficiently large numbers of plants. Some groups that had solved the data acquisition problem were having trouble analyzing the large number of raw files with computer algorithms to generate phenotype data, while other groups were held back from achieving the desired level of new understanding by difficulties in executing the appropriate statistical modeling that ultimately identifies the genetic elements controlling the phenotype. Our general conclusion is that efforts should be made to develop communities of practice* in each of the three areas highlighted in the figure &ndash; Acquisition, Analysis, and Modeling. As the cyberinfrastructure needed to make each of these stages of the generic phenotyping pipeline becomes stronger and capable of executing the most common tasks, the somewhat overlapping communities of practice should focus on creating the interoperability needed to make the separate tools function as a pipeline enterprise, an end-to-end cyberinfrastructure for creating new biological understanding out of raw files containing phenotype data of which images are currently the most common type. Success in these endeavors could substantially improve the efficiency of research aimed at understanding the function of plant genes.

*Communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly. From http://wenger-trayner.com/introduction-to-communities-of-practice/

68,"This EAGER award promotes a new paradigm in the development of an integrative and interoperable data and knowledge management system for the geosciences for a new NSF initiative called EarthCube. Led by a team of experts from academia and the private section, the funded work is focused on developing the key EarthCube cyberinfrastructure capability of brokering, which among other things enables sharing of very diverse data across disciplinary and technological boundaries.  It also allows data repositories to easily expose and make discoverable their data to potential users via multiple standards and services. The approach employed utilizes an inclusive, community-driven, collaborative approach to the problem and emphasizes the testing and evaluation of different brokering technologies using community-agreed upon standard datasets and applications, such as water sustainability, geohazards, biodiversity loss, and climate change. The work substantially and positively impacts our ability to carry out quantitative data-enabled research in the geo- and environmental sciences.  The project includes technical assessments of existing technologies, the development of a brokering roadmap that will mature ideas and technology over the next few years, and will engage a broad and diverse community of geoscientists, cyberinfrastructure developers, and computer scientists. Broader impacts of the work include maturation of a key capability that is required for the realization of EarthCube, a new NSF initiative in geoscience knowledge and data management, the engagement of a broad spectrum of individuals from the geoscience, cyberinfrastructure, and computer science communities, the inclusion of members of under-represented groups in the leadership team, and international collaboration with partners in France, Germany, and Canada.",NSF,4900,"REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO, THE","3100 Marine Street, Room 481",Boulder,US,Boulder,CO02,University of Colorado at Boulder,CO,803031058,47.050,"['Ruth E Duerr', 'Mark A Parsons', 'Jay  Pearlman', 'Francoise  Pearlman']",03/28/2012,007431505,218524,03/31/2013,4900,GEOINFORMATICS,218524,1239841,007431505,Siri Jodha S Khalsa,3100 Marine Street,Boulder,US,Boulder,CO02,University of Colorado at Boulder,CO,803031058,khalsa@colorado.edu,Siri Jodha,Khalsa,S,3034921445,bransom@nsf.gov,Barbara L.

The proliferation of data sources, modeling and simulation tools, processing environments and distributed computing platforms which have been developed to address these challenges has itself created challenges stemming from the vast data volumes, diverse data types, semantic differences between communities, and siloed access to information through discipline-specific cyber-infrastructure capabilities. This project begins to address these challenges by testing and evaluating ""brokering"" technologies that enable data repositories to easily expose their data via multiple standards and services. Such technologies, when deployed as a cyber-infrastructure service, allow repositories to meet the needs of diverse communities by providing data in ways that make sense to those communities without requiring significant changes in the repositoryÆs current practice. A key output of this project is the development of a longer-term strategy for building and deploying the capabilities that are needed to help realize NSFÆs EarthCube cyber-infrastructure vision.

 

The most significant results of this project were: the creation of a roadmap for broker implementation in EarthCube; the technical assessment of several brokering approaches; and the recognition by the EarthCube community of the importance of brokering in achieving the goals of EarthCube. This was evidenced by the increased use, through the course of the project, of brokering concepts and terminology in the dialog among the EarthCube Concept Awards and Community Groups, in the various forums such as the EarthCube ning website (http://earthcube.ning.com/group/brokering) , the EarthCube second Charrette, and in the Roadmaps that were produced by the funded EarthCube activities. The project advanced a community-based approach to implementation of the EarthCube cyberinfrastructure by including a broad spectrum of disciplines and stakeholders in its multi-disciplinary, international team.

Major Activities in this project included:

Developed a ""Brokering Manifesto"" describing the principles, premises and place of brokering in the EarthCube Cyberinfrastructure. 
Evaluated various brokering solutions in a series of experiments that the broad EarthCube community was invited to participate in. These ""Hack-a-thons"" provided hand's on experience with configuring and testing brokering middleware using information resources brought to the table by the EarthCube community
Gained operational experience with one brokering solution, the GI-Cat from CNR (http://www.essi-lab.eu) at various locations including modifications to improve  data and information discovery
Organized a meeting of Principal Investigators of all the EarthCube Concept Awards to address unfinished business of the second EarthCube Community Event (Charrette, June 2012), specifically, harmonization of timelines and developing recommendations for advancing EarthCube's agenda. Held a webinar to inform the broader EarthCube community on the outcomes of the meeting
Disseminated information on project activities through the EarthCube ning website (http://earthcube.ning.com/group/brokering) , a project newsletter, conference papers, webinars and direct communication with other EarthCube groups.
Maintained an outreach program to inform the broader geoscience community about EarthCube developments. This included presentations at international conferences, and one-day workshop on EarthCube at the kickoff meeting of the COOPEUS European Commission framework project, which focuses on European and US collaboration.

69,"This project aims to enable breakthroughs and innovations in education models, concepts and processes to enhance training through the integration of state-of-the-art computer simulations into STEM curricula. These computational tools will help to cultivate a new crop of innovators who will face global challenges in energy and the environment. Syracuse University Scientific Exploration through Simulation (SETS) project is an important first step in the development of cyber infrastructure that will enable the implementation of novel and unique mechanisms and help create and train a workforce well-equipped to use computer simulations as a means of scientific discovery. In this demonstration phase of the SETS project, the team is focusing on the development and implementation of a sustainable and scalable mechanism to allow for the infusion of state-of-the-art computational tools into K-12 STEM education at multiple schools in the Syracuse area.  This is focused upon in silico (computer) design and discovery of energy materials. 

The intellectual merit of the proposed project stems from mating advances in interface generation, cloud computing, and open source computational simulation with sound curricular principles to train a new generation of scientists and teachers to reinforce classroom learning, promote after school project-oriented explorations and engage students in hypothesis-driven research and discovery, and to, ultimately, tackle the formidable challenges in the renewable energy arena. To support the achievement of the overall goal, the following project objectives have been established: 
1. The training of highly qualified STEM teachers 
2. The design of use cases that will allow for multiple-levels of student engagement, ranging from in class demonstrations and homework exercise to longer-term hypothesis driven research 
3. The creation of necessary cyber infrastructure components, by developing consistent easy-to-use user interfaces, an online repository of completed simulations and distributed location service and cloud man-agement 

 4. The implementation of the developed in silico learning mechanism in K-12 STEM education through a limited number of pilot projects 

The proposed activities will allow for broader participation among diverse groups of students and teachers within the Syracuse area. In addition, transformative broader impacts are anticipated based on the synergies among the component features in the cyberinfrastructure tools to be developed in this project. First, the simulations are based on free open source software that can be customizable by other groups. Second, the user interface will be accessible to users with basic computer proficiency. From a curricular point of view, the interface-driven simulations unveil the concepts, relationships, processes, mechanisms, models, and applications which are otherwise hidden in the methodological/algorithmic complexities. Third, the potential for expansion of the cloud-enabled approach is limitless. A natural extension of the demonstration project is to make the use cases accessible to a large number of schools in the I-90 corridor of Upstate NY State. Nationwide implementation can also be achieved by other groups emulating the approach and software tools. Such efforts will continuously enrich the library of curricular materials, which can be disseminated via the National Science Digital Library or through ftp sites. Cloud-enabled simulations will also be beneficial to user communities such as R&D scientists in the many small technology startups focused on the development of functional nanomaterials, efficient photovoltaics and photocatalytic processes.",NSF,4900,SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY,OFFICE OF SPONSORED PROGRAMS,SYRACUSE,US,Syracuse,NY24,Syracuse University,NY,132441200,47.070,"['Steve J Chapin', 'Arindam  Chakraborty']",08/05/2011,002257350,249940,07/31/2014,4900,CI-TEAM,249940,1135486,002257350,Radhakrishna  Sureshkumar,,Syracuse,US,Syracuse,NY24,Syracuse University,NY,132441200,rsureshk@syr.edu,Radhakrishna,Sureshkumar,,3154433194,achtchel@nsf.gov,Almadena Y.

The role of such simulations in design and discovery in various fields of engineering and technology was emphasized through examples derived from contemporary research.

The major impact of the SETS project on Cyber Infrastructure is the development of curricular materials for visualization and analysis of molecular structures as well as molecular simulations. These range from relatively simple tools such as AVOGADRO that can be installed and run on laptops or notebooks to molecular dynamics simulation software such as GROMACS used routinely in design and discovery in R&amp;D, the execution of which requires parallel computing platforms. The curriculum also provides the technical knowhow about the use of operating systems, editing environment, data curation, post-processing and visualization. All of the materials are built on open source software, thereby avoiding the need for licensing agreements/fees and allowing for user-driven improvements and innovations. By making available a systematic curriculum that contains an array of open source software, the SETS project has significantly increased the access of communities of students and educators to state of the art computational chemistry tools.

The SETS project has contributed significantly to Chemistry Education as evidenced by the feedback received from the student and teacher participants. The teachers felt that the use of computer simulations into the student experience is an improvement over the tried-and-true traditional methods of teaching molecular geometry and dynamics.  Further molecular simulations were found to be extremely useful in reinforcing concepts while sparking interest in open-ended and student-driven inquiry leading to identification of research topics. This is evidenced by the fact that many of the project alumni chose to pursue research at Syracuse University or elsewhere. In some case, the SETS project experience was identified by students as a key determinant of their decision to pursue higher studies in a STEM discipline.

Stations are morphing from being facilities that provided infrastructure for field-based research to proactive entities that actively direct research towards emerging areas of knowledge, generate baseline data through biophysical monitoring, and compile, archive, and facilitate synthesis and reuse of data generated in their midst. This new profile increases the effectiveness of field stations as research centers, because they: (a) provide basic long-term monitoring of biophysical data (e.g., through meteorological stations), which allows both researchers to understand their observed patterns and station staff to document any changes in their biophysical conditions, (b) focus research efforts in critical areas of knowledge and reduce duplication of efforts, and (c) act as a data repository to ensure that long-term data that is collected by the individual efforts of researchers and research teams are not only secured, but available for further reuse.  This profile responds to two critical drivers: the urgent need to understand how our world is changing and the need to optimize research resources. This project provides the technological infrastructure that will allow three cutting-edge tropical field research stations to update and upgrade their biophysical monitoring equipment and to establish a Tropical node of DataONE. The upgraded biophysical monitoring equipment will allow the stations to more reliably track environmental variables, such as air and soil temperature and moisture, rainfall, solar intensity, and available water. The Tropical node of DataONE will allow the Organization for Tropical Studies to become the first tropical field station network to proactively retrieve and store data collected over 50 years so that it will be available to the whole scientific community for analyzing temporal and historical trends, measuring changes in the last half century, and projecting the fate of tropical forests.   

Despite the deluge of information that has accumulated among field stations, these data are not readily available (Borgman et al. 2007). Most historical ecological field data are scattered and inaccessible, unintelligible (no metadata) or dispersed across platforms and digital formats hindering their reuse and synthesis (Heidorn 2008). Such dark data are at risk of being lost forever when scientists retire or die. Also, most field stations institutionally monitor a suite of biogeophysical variables (such as meteorological data) as a reference for the research community that they serve, but often these long-term data series are inconsistently collected and maintained and hard to access. Changing norms in data sharing and an increased scientific need for historical data on natural systems impose the responsibility on field stations to recover and archive dark data from historical field studies and to standardize, update, and make available past and current biogeophysical monitoring data. This project enables the Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS) to establish an Institutional Data Repository for data generated at its three field stations in Costa Rica for almost 50 years. The data repository will be part of DataONE network and will archive and make available biogeophysical monitoring data collected institutionally (e.g., meteorological and hydrological data, GIS files, and digital biological collections) as well as data collected by independent researchers who have conducted field research at the stations. The project also will allow OTS to upgrade, standardize, and automate further its meteorological stations to collect climatic and hydrological data. Both components of this project will foster field research that leverages historic data as a reference for new observations and facilitate secondary e-research on historic and current trends of terrestrial tropical ecosystems. Such research will greatly expand the ability of scientists to assess impacts of global change on tropical systems and to improve the representation of key tropical terrestrial ecosystem processes in earth system models. This project will set a new standard for open access of data and expand research opportunities for the broader scientific community. Furthermore, the data will enhance the opportunities for new generations of young scientists who conduct research at the stations (as research assistants, through fellowships, or on site-based REU programs) or who participate in OTS field-courses centered at the stations (through OTS graduate and undergraduate programs) or who visit the stations independently through faculty-led educational experiences.

McCartney,7032928470,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"This is a new age for field research stations, both in terms of the changing environment in which they operate and the way in which scientists conduct research. New opportunities arise but they have associated challenges. Field stations are uniquely positioned to shed light on global change because they provide long-term, site-based accumulation of information through long-term monitoring and cumulative studies on a wide array of bio-physical systems at different spatial and temporal scales. However, research at field stations has been conducted by individual scientists or small teams and the data they have produced is scattered and inaccessible or dispersed across sites, platforms and digital formats making it difficult to find for reuse and synthesis.

 

Furthermore, field stations also actively collect biophysical data (e.g., meteorological variables) because they provide an important ecological reference to the research community they serve. However, sustaining a continued monitoring effort over a long period is challenging, especially when the necessary physical or organizational infrastructure are limited. Often the data collected institutionally are inconsistently collected, poorly curated and hard to access. Weather data from tropical research stations are notoriously discontinuous through time. The challenge of standardizing, controlling quality and making available such data has become progressively more urgent as the demand for biogeophysical indicators of a changing climate increase.

 

These two issues of data accessibility and quality are now easier to tackle as newer instruments and systems are developed. Automated solar powered systems are improving the quality and reliability of collecting and archiving biophysical data. Also, new cyber-tools are improving the capacity of field stations to compile, archive, and share data generated in those facilities by researchers. This opens the possibility for researchers to generate even more knowledge by reusing data accumulated over time.  These changes in data acquisition and sharing are fostering an evolution in the role of field stations as sites for research.

 

Tropical forests are a key biome of global and regional significance, because of their sensitivity to a changing climate and their potential feedbacks to the earth system. Unfortunately, they are inadequately represented in modeling efforts. The data generated at the Organization for Tropical Studies three field stations, in particular, represent a unique collection of reference points for this Neotropical region, and an invaluable asset built by thousands of researchers over 50 years.

 

This project improved the infrastructure for collection, recovery, archiving, and sharing long-term sets of biological, biophysical and climatological data from at a network of tropical research stations through two main actions: Upgrading the station&acute;s capacity to collect reliable and standardized meteorological data and creating a cyber platform to archive this data and data generated by researchers in the past and the future.

 

In 2016, La Selva, Las Cruces, and Palo Verde Research Stations were upgraded with state-of-art automated and manual sensors to monitor air temperature and moisture, rainfall, barometric pressure, solar radiation, wind velocity and direction, soil moisture, and dew point for leaves. All of these variables produce relevant information regarding the climate.  Furthermore, OTS also upgraded its hydrological sensor array (located in Palo Verde), which is being used to monitor water balance in the lower part of the watershed, where the Palo Verde wetland (an internationally renowned wetland) is located.

 

Furthermore, OTS created a data repository named ""Organization for Tropical Studies NeoTropical Data Center (OTS-NTDC)"". This repository is part of a global network called DataONE. DataONE is a global network with standardized data management protocols and back-up data archiving and sharing, that was created and funded by NSF. DataONE actively promotes preservation, access, use and reuse of scientific data. It is also designed to increase discoverability of data, thus allowing repositories to make their data and services more accessible to the international community.  Thus, the OTS node in the DataONE network will ensure the safety, stability, and discoverability of the data by scientists. At this point, the data repository has been seeded with data generated by OTS meteorological stations.  However, OTS is committed to archiving all data generated in ongoing and future research at its stations, and as much historic data as it can recover from former researchers.

In summary, this project is setting up a new standard for data management at tropical research stations. By creating a facility to archive and share data, it is changing how data are managed. It will also create the basis for a new generation of researchers that will use historic data to address question regarding global change. Furthermore, it is setting a new standard on biophysical monitoring for harsh, ecologically complex and diverse sites. This high quality data will contribute to better modeling and projections on climate change.

The project consists of three objectives: (i) Building 10Gbps software-defined network (SDN) with OpenFlow switches and controllers to provide multiple virtual network slices to each group; (ii) Transferring Big Data with automatically tuned operation through multiple optical paths over the SDN network achieving at most 20Gbps of aggregated disk-to-disk transfer rate; and (iii) Analyzing Big Data by developing data-intensive distributed computing frameworks with Hadoop and MPI technologies parallelizing large number of jobs over HPC clusters.
 
Those three components are integrated with a web portal service and a GENI-enabled network management system. To achieve high disk-to-disk transfer rate at 20Gbps, the project has an industrial partnership with Samsung Electronics that contributes 70TB Solid State Drive (SSD) storage and optimizes the I/O bandwidth.
 
The cyber-infrastructure accelerates the current Big Data research projects spanning a wide range of research areas including gene sequencing research at Biology and Vet School, computational chemistry, big data mining at Computer Science, coastal hazard simulation research at civil and environmental engineering.

 The developed outcomes of the BIC-LSU project have enabled the transformative changes of universities into the future campus-wide collaborative research environment integrating research groups, Big data, high-speed networks and high-performance computing (HPC) cyberinfrastructures.
The successful outcomes of the project include the SDN-based 40Gbps networks consisting of OpenFlow HP switches, Ryu-based OpenFlow controllers, high-speed data transfer applications; a web-portal system with single sign-on authentication; and a set of large-scale software tools which can be executed at HPC clusters for big data analysis.
 With the produced outcomes, researchers can transfer big datasets within the designated 40Gbps network easily and analyze the datasets over HPC clusters fast in parallel.
 The established frameworks in this project will accelerate the Big Science Discovery. In addition, the methodology in the project will have broad and indirect impacts across science and engineering research groups, and on emerging and nontraditional research areas, which will produce Big data and require cyberinfrastructures.

75,"This team at SUNY at Buffalo is developing POP!World, a cloud infrastructure-enabled comprehensive platform for experiential learning, education, training and research in population genetics and evolutionary biology. Population genetics is one of the foundations of the modern evolutionary synthesis. It enables discoveries in all areas of evolutionary study and provides tools for predicting the outcome of evolutionary events. The proposed integrated platform will support a wide range of tools from simple learning at the K-12 level up through college and on to applied research on genetic outcomes. This project will address the primary goal of the CI-TEAM solicitation ?Prepare current and future generations of scientists, engineers, and educators to design and develop as well as adopt and deploy cyber-based tools and environments for research and learning, both formal and informal?. 

The major goal of POP!World is to leverage the advances in cyber-infrastructure to improve accessibility of important biological concepts to students at all levels. It is designed to empower a broad spectrum of users with access to cyber-enabled scientific resources, tools and platforms, thus, preparing the next generation of scientists. In informal settings the features of this platform will be used to inspire K-12 students and kindle their interest in STEM areas. POP!World offers a highly engaging alternative to currently prevalent textual environments that fail to captivate net-generation audiences. It is also more mathematically focused than currently available graphical interfaces, allowing it to be used as a basic teaching tool and expanded to higher education levels and collaborative research platforms. Special features of the project include a professional education and research platform for high-fidelity simulations of microevolutionary processes (e.g.: selection, mutation, migration, genetic drift, and non random mating). The tool includes interactive simulation with visually appealing displays of outcomes; status panels displaying computed and derived information from the input and simulation process, student evaluation modules, and research components for setting up hypothetical experiments. 

The project is serving as a model to demonstrate the practical challenges and solutions in transforming the emerging cloud infrastructure to multi-disciplinary tool development. The tool will be universally accessible via the cloud machine images, and will run on the cloud using its computational capabilities thus not limiting the user machine. Although this project is initially using Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Google App Engine as cloud hosts, the tool can be easily adapted to other cloud environments. Cloud-enabling allows for easy set-up for training sessions and offers a truly scalable model for mass dissemination of POP!World. The project will be developed using open-source software and will itself be available as open-source under GNU public licensing. Cyber-savvy students will be not only the users of the POP!World but also be the creative force behind the design and implementation of the tool. We plan to develop major components of the POP!World as capstone projects for students majoring in Computer Science & Engineering and Bioinformatics. 

Intellectual Merit: The project is a synergistic inter-disciplinary collaboration among investigators from Computer Science & Engineering and Biological Sciences. The PI has background in grid-computing and data-intensive computing research and education and in tool building. She has successfully implemented an NSF-supported curriculum for data-intensive computing. She is guiding the design and implementation of POP!World. The co-PIs will are using their extensive experience in population genetics, evolutionary biology, and course design to guide the theoretical and practical science aspects of the project and demonstrate POP!World?s diverse use in introductory and advanced courses of the biology curriculum. The external consultant has a unique background as an award winning community college professor and a retired program manager of a Fortune 500 company. 

Broader Impact: The POP!World project showcases the impact of the emerging cloud-infrastructures on multi-disciplinary collaboration and research.  It illustrates an affordable and effectively adaptable delivery mechanism (i.e. the cloud) for scientific innovations to a wide demographic, and will make the technology highly accessible to a variety of organizations. This is expected to engage a diverse population of many types of participants (students K-12, educators, researchers, adult learners, etc.). POP!World can be used as learning tool for attracting, retaining and engaging the net-generation workforce at all levels and in multiple disciplines. It is expected to have a very broad impact on improving the preparedness of our Sciences & Engineering tech-savvy workforce by supporting exciting visual interactions, experimentation involving ""what if"" inquiries for learning and research.

Our two core goals were to improve mathematical literacy in evolutionary biology, and to provide a scalable and sustainable tool to educators of all levels, by means of cloud computing.

Why math and evolution? Biology (and evolution) is still seen as a science that relies only in a minor way on quantitative methods.  Alas, contemporary biology requires a rather advanced understanding of math.  Unfortunately, the majority of incoming undergraduates are ill-prepared for math, which invariably leads to a great deal of frustration.  Understanding the complexity behind evolution is especially challenging, and fraught with models, differential equations and derivations.  As evolution is rarely suited to a traditional bench lab environment, we believe that experiments may be best demonstrated through interactive computer simulation.  Students can more easily understand information and abstract concepts when they can see how they work.  Built in a video game style, our application plays to the strengths of todayÆs generation, making use of their familiarity with highly visual technologies.  Specifically, we let students model evolution in populations, introducing them along to way to the forces of microevolution, and their subsequent effects on macroevolutionary processes.  Alongside the self-paced game area, we display the actual mathematical steps, so students can intuitively connect practice and evolutionary theory.

Why the cloud?  Two problems in todayÆs educational landscape are consistency of and accessibility to resources.  Using the recently emerging infrastructure of cloud computing may remediate these issues.  Specifically, the cloud allows an easy way to share tools, and adjust content and capacity on the fly without investing in a completely new infrastructure, training new personnel, or licensing new software.  Effectively, anyone with access to the web, be that a high school classroom, a university computer lab, or a research facility, can use the same tool, at the same time, independent of physical location or platform.  This not only facilitates a more decentralized approach to learning (i.e. students can do labs on their own schedules), but also encourages the development of modular education packages, where the same core program can be used and adjusted to different levels.  We are doing just that and plan to scale this software between middle and high school audiences all the way up to a graduate student/research scientist level.

Where are we at?  Our team completed all goals, and developed a scalable and sustainable cloud-deployed learning environment that is publically accessible by any educator worldwide (http://popworld15.appspot.com/). All modules were developed under a public licensing agreement, and access and use will be completely free of charge. The module is being used since 2010 by 1500 + students at the undergraduate level at the University at Buffalo, as well as several other universities and some high schools (nationally). One other important aspect of our project is that use in the classroom at UB allowed us to measure learning outcomes, and assess if this learning tool actually works. Survey responses collected over 5 years indicate that students perceive the tool as helpful, and a significantly higher interest in the field of evolution is reported. Student evaluations suggest an increased performance in the population genetics modules. Results from this research have been published in the Journal of College Science Teaching, and were presented at several national conferences concerned with education and the use of technology.

Virtual Organizations Workshop

We propose to organize a series of two workshops on the design, construction, evaluation, and operation of virtual organizations. The first of these workshops will focus on identifying a cross-cutting research agenda in the area of virtual organizations. The second will focus on the pragmatic issues of building and operating functional virtual organizations within the context of the deployed NSF Cyber infrastructure.
Intellectual Merit.

The invitees of this workshop will consist of leading researchers from the diverse disciplines who have been studying aspects of virtual organizations and distributed collaborative work as well as leading researchers within the communities that represent both current and potential members of virtual communities. In bringing together these researchers who typically do not have a forum for interacting, these workshops will help identify key research challenges, criteria for evaluation and end user requirements for virtual organizations. These results will be captured in the form of a workshop report and disseminated to the National Science Foundation and the various constituent communities. In addition, these workshops will provide an opportunity to identify new opportunities for collaboration and cross cutting research activities in the important area of virtual organizations.

Broader Impacts.
The Office of Cyber-infrastructure has identified virtual organizations as a fundamental element of its infrastructure plan. While there have been a variety of collaborations organized around general concept of virtual organizations, to date, no comprehensive understanding of fundamental mechanisms, infrastructure requirements, operational principles or evaluation criteria has emerged. The proposed workshops will take a critical first step in creating this understanding. As a result, the workshop reports should have a significant impact on the research and development agendas of the disciplines represented in the workshop. Furthermore, we anticipate that both the collaborations initiated by the workshop and the resulting report can have a significant impact on shaping the way virtual organizations are supported in Cyber-infrastructure, as well as obviously the effectiveness of the various user communities of a national scale cyber-infrastructure. Finally, in addition to the direct participation of women and under-represented minorities in the workshops, a significant result of virtual organizations is to remove geographic and organizational barriers to participation. To that that end, the contributions that these workshops will make to the advance the understanding and practice of virtual organizations can only serve to level the playing field and subsequently opening new opportunities for participation for all citizens.

79,"Power systems have seen many changes over the last decade including the increased penetration of renewable generation, electric vehicles and new technologies for sensing, communication and control of a Smart Grid. The most significant impact of these changes are being felt at the consumer level. The ability for consumers and end devices to buy and sell energy and related services in a dynamic and interactive manner is expected to create a transactive energy market as highlighted in the Dec 2014 report of GridWise Alliance.  Modeling and preparing the physical system to respond to the somewhat unpredictable  behavior  of  active  consumers over  a  cyber-infrastructure  will  be  critical  for maintaining grid reliability.  Understanding the impact of such active consumers on the operational and business policies of the distribution utility requires advances in core system science that spans the areas of power engineering, economics, statistical signal processing, game theory, distributed control, multi-agent systems and cyber security. In conjunction with industrial partners, Westar Energy (the largest electric company in Kansas) and Kansas City Power and Light, the PIs plan to develop an architecture that requires little change to the existing investment in power distribution systems while allowing for the  dynamic,  adaptive  control  required  to  integrate  active  consumers  with  current  and  future combinations of high-variability distributed power sources, such as Photo-voltaic (PV) generators and storage batteries.  

In contrast to prior related efforts that primarily focus on demand response and distributed generation management with a single home/user centric approach, the proposed approach takes a holistic system perspective that includes cumulative modeling of multiple stochastic active consumers and the cyber infrastructure over which they may interact.  Specific research thrusts include: (1) a general, extensible, and secure cyber architecture based on holonic multi-agent principles that provides a pathway to the emerging area of transactive energy market in power distribution systems, but also provides foundation for  other  engineered  systems  with  active  consumers;  (2)  new  analytical  insights  into  generalized stochastic modeling of consumer response to real]time price of electricity and the impact of such active consumers on grid reliability and security, and (3) novel methodology for comprehensive distributed control and management of power distribution systems with active consumers and high penetration of distributed renewable resources.  Active consumers are an integral part of the Smart City vision where cyber systems are integrated into the transportation, energy, healthcare and biomedical, and critical infrastructure systems. Successful completion of this project will result in modeling, control, analysis and simulation architectures for all such active consumer driven CPS domains. The resulting gains in operating efficiency, economics, reliability and security will result in overall welfare for the society.",NSF,4900,KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY,2 FAIRCHILD HALL,Manhattan,US,Manhattan,KS01,Kansas State University,KS,665061100,47.070,"['Sanjoy  Das', 'Scott A DeLoach']",09/17/2015,929773554,700000,09/30/2019,4900,CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (CPS),700000,1544705,041146432,Bala  Natarajan,2 Fairchild Hall,Manhattan,US,Manhattan,KS01,Kansas State University,KS,665065204,bala@ksu.edu,Bala,Natarajan,,7855324597,rbaheti@nsf.gov,Radhakisan S.

80,"As the scale and complexity of computing and data infrastructures supporting science and engineering grow, power costs are becoming important concerns in terms of costs, reliability and overall sustainability. As a result, it is becoming increasingly important to understand power/performance behaviors and tradeoffs from an application perspective for emerging system configuration, i.e., those with multiple cores, deep memory hierarchies and accelerators. This project builds an instrumented experimental platform that supports such an understanding, and enables research and training activities in this area. Specifically, the proposed experimental platform is composed of nodes with a deep memory architecture that contains four different levels: DRAM, PCIe-based non-volatile memory, solid-state drive and spinning hard disk, in addition to accelerators. Power metering is deployed as part of the infrastructure.

The experimental platform enables the experimental exploration of the power/performance behaviors of large scale computing systems and datacenters as well as compute and data intensive application they support, and uniquely supports research toward understanding the management and optimization of these systems and applications. It also enables research in multiple areas, including: application-aware cross-layer management, power-performance tradeoffs for data-intensive scientific workflows and thermal implications of deep memory hierarchies in virtualized Cloud environments.
 
Data and compute intensive applications are becoming increasingly critical to a wide range of domains, and the ability to develop large-scale and sustainable platforms and software infrastructure to support these applications will have significant impact in driving research and innovations in these domains.

The major goal of this project was to develop an instrumented experimental platform that can enable such an understanding and can fundamentally enable research and training activities in this area. This experimental infrastructure enables the experimental exploration of the power/performance behaviors of large scale computing systems and datacenters as well as compute and data intensive application they support and supports research toward the understanding of the management and optimization of these systems and applications. Central to these efforts is understanding energy/performance tradeoffs for data-intensive scientific workflows and develop smarter application-aware cross-layer power management at different levels. 

There are many research accomplishments under these goals. A list of some of the outcomes of the project is provided below.

We designed and constructed CAPER (Computational and      dAta Platform for Energy efficiency Research), which is a      unique and flexible experimental platform composed of nodes with a deep      memory architecture with four different levels: DRAM, PCIe-based NVRAM,      solid-state drive (SSD) and spinning hard disk. CAPER combines high      performance Intel Xeon processors with a complete deep memory hierarchy,      latest generation coprocessors (i.e., Intel Xeon Phi), high-performance      network interconnects, and comprehensive system power instrumentation.
We implemented a comprehensive and scalable monitoring      platform using big data technologies such as HDFS and Apache Hadoop.
We studied the costs incurred by the different in-situ      analysis strategies in terms of execution time, scalability and power      consumption, which is a fundamental issue of a large-scale workflows.
We characterized the performance and energy behaviors      of each level of the memory hierarchy and evaluated the performance and      energy consumption of different data management strategies and data      exchange patterns, as well as the energy/performance tradeoffs associated      with data placement, data movement and data processing.
We studied performance and power/energy tradeoffs of      different data processing configurations and data movement strategies, and      how to balance these tradeoffs with the quality of solution.
We evaluated the costs incurred by the different      in-situ data analysis strategies for large-scale systems (e.g., combustion      simulations) in terms of execution time, scalability and power consumption.
We explored the local recovery for stencil-based      parallel applications, which represent a significant set of physical      simulations.
We explored how to manage power budgets dynamically      leveraging the properties of AMR (Adaptive Mesh Refinement) algorithms,      which is a new approach for power and workload management.
We supported other research activities that required      the use of CAPER power instrumentation and/or the use of deep memory      hierarchies such as the study of energy-efficient autonomic cyber-security      strategies, data analytics at large scale, imaging-based medical research,


In addition, this project provided training to postdocs and graduate students. The work resulted in a plethora of publications including referenced journal and conference papers, and numerous presentations. Keynotes and invited talks were given at many esteemed forums such as the ACM/IEEE International Conferences for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis, IEEE International Parallel &amp; Distributed Processing Symposium, IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing, in many countries throughout the world (e.g., Japan, Colombia, Italy, Germany, Spain).

Some of the research findings were also disseminated to the general public via the educational outreach programs such as the Aresty Research Center (Division of Undergraduate Academic Affairs at Rutgers University) and the New Jersey Governor?s School of Engineering and Technology.

An experimental instrument platform has been developed, which provides an instrument for conducting research in different areas related to the study of power/energy efficiency, deep memory hierarchies and data analysis. Further, this research has enabled the development of other NSF-funded research projects and has influenced the design of large-scale computing platforms such as Caliburn at Rutgers.

81,"Cybersecurity has become a matter of national and global importance because of the economy's dependence on the Internet, and on cyber-infrastructure. Workforce development through cyber education and training are key towards protecting the ever-growing cyberspace and cyberinfrastructure. However, US universities are not graduating nearly sufficient workforce in the IT areas, let alone cybersecurity. Academic programs in STEM and IT fields are uniquely positioned to address this need. Tailoring curricula in these areas to include cyber education can bridge the gap existing between the demand and supply of trained workforce. Existing certificate programs do not offer a data analytics perspective along with a software security and network security perspective for undergraduate curricula. In addition, the existing certificates are not seamlessly integrated with the existing curriculum towards a bachelor?s degree. This project is motivated to fill this gap.

The key objective of this project is to increase the capacity in the cybersecurity workforce by creating, delivering and assessing a new undergraduate certificate program in cybersecurity. This will include developing a model curriculum and material for undergraduate cyber education grounded on the pedagogical literature. In addition, this project will design and develop intervention strategies using peer mentoring between advanced cybersecurity courses and an entry level Information Systems course. This will provide a framework for learning and retention through peer mentoring, early intervention strategies, group engagement, critical thinking through capstone projects, and individualized learning of deeper issues in cybersecurity through one-on-one interactions with faculty. A certificate program will be designed to increase interest in cyber education as well as increase retention and completion of the program by undergraduate students. The project will also include qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the effectiveness of the certificate program. The certificate program will (a) Develop skills in technical, analytical, software security, and critical thinking, (b) Allow students to apply the knowledge gained to projects that simulate real-life problems, (c) Nurture and support innovative thinking in solving some of the key challenges facing the cyber world, (d) Expose students to various career opportunities in the cyber industry and connect them with relevant professional groups, and (e) Increase the cybersecurity workforce capacity to support this pervasive area with a growing importance in society.

82,"Citizen science engages members of the public in science. It advances the progress of science by involving more people and embracing new ideas. Recent projects use software and apps to do science more efficiently. However, existing citizen science software and databases are ad hoc, non-interoperable, non-standardized, and isolated, resulting in data and software siloes that hamper scientific advancement. This project will develop new software and integrate existing software, apps, and data for citizen science - allowing expanded discovery, appraisal, exploration, visualization, analysis, and reuse of software and data. Over the three phases, the software of two platforms, CitSci.org and CyberTracker, will be integrated and new software will be built to integrate and share additional software and data. The project will: (1) broaden the inclusivity, accessibility, and reach of citizen science; (2) elevate the value and rigor of citizen science data; (3) improve interoperability, usability, scalability and sustainability of citizen science software and data; and (4) mobilize data to allow cross-disciplinary research and meta-analyses. These outcomes benefit society by making citizen science projects such as those that monitor disease outbreaks, collect biodiversity data, monitor street potholes, track climate change, and any number of other possible topics more possible, efficient, and impactful through shared software. 

The project will develop a cyber-enabled Framework for Advancing Buildable and Reusable Infrastructures for Citizen Science (Cyber-FABRICS) to elevate the reach and complexity of citizen science while adding value by mobilizing well-documented data to advance scientific research, meta-analyses, and decision support. Over the three phases of the project, the software of two platforms, CitSci.org and CyberTracker, will be integrated by developing APIs and reusable software libraries for these and other platforms to use to integrate and share data and software. Using participatory design and agile methods over four years, the project will: (1) broaden the inclusivity, accessibility, and reach of citizen science; (2) elevate the value and rigor of citizen science software and data; (3) improve interoperability, usability, scalability and sustainability of citizen science software and data; and (4) mobilize data to allow cross-disciplinary research and meta-analyses. These outcomes benefit society by making citizen science projects and any number of other possible topics more possible, efficient, and impactful through shared software and data. Adoption of Cyber-FABRICS infrastructure, software, and services will allow anyone with an Internet or cellular connection, including those in remote, underserved, and international communities, to contribute to research and monitoring, either independently or as a team.

Title: 	MRI/Dev.: Advanced Visualization Instrumentation for the Collaborative Exploration of Big Data
Project Proposed:
This project, developing a Scalable Omni-Presence Environment (ScOPE), a next generation visualization system for collaborative exploration of large volumes of data, provides an environment for analyzing, processing, and visualizing Big Data resulting from many different areas of science and engineering. The instrument serves as an integrative, virtual metaphor for a combined microscope and telescope, enabling users to explore data from the nano to macro to mega scale. ScOPE provides researchers the ability to study simulated and acquired data at a level of precision previously unmatched. It is expected to become the platform for training a new generation of users to be fluent in data analytics in collaborative environments. Initially, three universities will have direct access to the ScOPE instrument and all its features: U. California-San Diego (UCSD), Jackson State U. (JSU), and U of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). Nonetheless, following the tradition of the project team (effectively done with earlier generations of visualization technologies (e.g., OptIPortal tile display walls now installed at more than 100 institutions worldwide), the critical components of the infrastructure will be broken such that they may be replicated for use at remote locations by other research or educational institutions. The developers anticipate that private-sector collaborators, such as Qualcomm and Intel, will help popularize use of specific components for the nation?s big-data analytics infrastructure. Notwithstanding, the broadest impact of the instrument should be evident in the discoveries and advances made by engineers and scientist that use ScOPE to enhance collaboration and analysis in the disciplines that have been singled out as ?Domain Drivers? for the project. These include projects led by researchers in ocean sciences (and ocean observatories); cyber-archaeology and cultural heritage diagnostics; real-time brain imaging; digital cinema and very-high quality digital media; integrative computational biology; underwater microscopy; molecular dynamics; structural biology and computational chemistry; and large-scale numerical simulation. In turn, these domain specialists will work alongside computer scientists who will address grand challenges in system architecture, data transport, security, representation, arching, processing multi-modal analytics, and human-computer interaction. ScOPE?s long-distance collaboration will be supported by telepresence at bandwidths ranging up to 40 Gigabits per second. Thus, the project creates a highly interactive collaboration space equipped with a natural human-computer interface and advanced 3D modeling and rendering at a sufficient scale to tackle complex experiments and analyze large amount of visual and numerical data pertaining to phenomena of wide dimensions and extreme time scales. Domain drivers have been identified to ensure that the resulting environment and tools are applicable to a broad array of scientific disciplines. These include earth system sciences, civil and structural engineering, mechanical and aerospace engineering, biomedical and electrical (and ocean observatories engineering, social sciences, and anthropology. This project takes a great leap forward into a new generation of collaborative environment that until recently was unthinkable. The display capabilities will no longer be passive; envisioned is a continuous spatial workspace imaging, including eye, skin response, and even mobile electroencephalography sensing, allowing ScOPE to respond to and infer user intent. The environment will be designed specifically to handle ?big data,? using a failure-tolerant and cloud-centric approach while also downsizing the supercomputer flash memory architecture. ?Big Data.? The instrument will enable scientific discoveries as well as research on how best to process, analyze, and visualize Scope will serve as a prototype for other similar instruments. The research enabled by ScOPE will have impacts in many areas of science.

The instrument will have direct impact on three universities, while the technology developed in building the instrument will inform the construction of similar instruments around the nation. To promote greater public appreciation of scientific research, the public will be invited to tour the visualization facilities, hopefully encouraging young people to enter career in science and engineering. The area of ScOPE accessible to the public will have significant impact on the public?s impression of academic research.

84,"Viruses, worms, and other self-propagating malware remain significant ongoing security threats to almost all sectors of the nation's cyber-infrastructure, including government, business, and home consumers.  The escalating rate of new malware appearances increasingly threatens to outpace the defense community's ability to maintain effective detection systems.  This is in part because many malware detection algorithms identify malicious software based on syntactic features.  Polymorphic malware continually evolves new syntaxes at it propagates, introducing hundreds or thousands of new syntaxes per day that implement the same malicious behavior.  Discovering practical, scalable techniques for reliably detecting new polymorphic malware variants is therefore one of the most significant challenges currently facing the computer security industry.

This project develops hybrid static-dynamic technologies that detect malware based on semantic rather than purely syntactic code features.  Thus, malware is identified based on the meaning of its malicious programming rather than the syntax with which it implements it.  Malicious payloads are identified by applying traditionally static code analyses to decrypted memory pages intercepted dynamically at runtime.  A major goal of the project is to develop technologies that are scalable and practical for standard computer hardware and operating systems.  This will allow wide-scale deployment of results, and help to protect the nation from distributed attacks that compromise large numbers of low-priority targets to attack higher-priority targets.  Results from the research will lead to powerful new strategies, concepts, and practical tools that give defenders a significant new advantage in the virus-antivirus arms race, and improving the national cyber-infrastructure's resilience against cyber-attacks.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT DALLAS,"800 W.

Greenspan,7032928910,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Malicious software (""malware"") attacks are an increasingly dangerous class of threats to modern computing systems, posing serious risks to our critical infrastructure, telecommunications, emergency preparedness, health care privacy, and military personnel.  One major reason malware attacks continue to succeed against even skillful defenders is the capability of modern malware to adapt and mutate in infinite varieties to bypass conventional defenses.  Such mutation is known as malware polymorphism.

This project has forged scientific methodologies, algorithms, and technologies that overcome conventional defenses? brittleness to polymorphism, to detect and/or thwart malware attacks in ways that are independent of its polymorphic capabilities.  Project discoveries include:

(1) the cultivation of a new science of automated program transformation, which allows defenses to look inside software and remove potentially dangerous program functionalities instead of waiting to see if malicious behavior manifests as the program executes;

(2) web security technologies that allow web page authors to embed defensive scripts into their pages, which protect visitors from malicious third-party content (e.g., malicious online advertisements) without the need for visitors to explicitly download or install any new software;

(3) scientific methodologies for mathematically proving that certain malware defenses reliably protect against all attacks in certain important attack classes---even future attack instances in the class that are presently unknown to defenders;

(4) active defense technologies that empower sophisticated defenders to ""fight back"" against malware attackers by reverse-infecting the adversary's command-and-control infrastructure;

(5) cyber-deceptive technologies that allow advanced defenders to misdirect adversaries into revealing critical new offensive technologies before those technologies become threats, allowing defenders to anticipate future attacks; and

(6) new malware defense technologies for cloud computing systems, which house increasing volumes of privacy-sensitive data, and are therefore prime targets of malware attacks.

Innovations and discoveries arising from this project were published in several of the highest-impact, most competitive and rigorous peer-reviewed scientific venues in the field, received multiple best paper awards, and are now being used in practice to enhance the security of military computing systems.  Educational outcomes include the development of new curricula and laboratory experiences for training future generations of IT experts in advanced detection and mitigation of malware attacks.

Proposal Number:	EPS - 1006833 
Institution:	South Carolina Research Authority
Project Director:	Bill Hogue 

This proposal will be awarded using funds made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5), and meets the requirements established in Section 2 of the White House Memorandum entitled, Ensuring Responsible Spending of Recovery Act Funds, dated March 20, 2009. 

The core philosophy guiding South Carolina?s (SC) RII C2-enabled Research and Education program is the engagement of a diverse group of institutions that bring complementary approaches to the research, education, and training of SC?s future STEM workforce. This diverse group ? comprising 3 HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) (South Carolina State University (SCSU), Claflin University and Benedict College), a 4-year institution (USC Beaufort (USCB)), and a rural research and education center (Edisto Research and Education Center (Edisto REC)) ? forms an alliance in support of institutional, NSF EPSCoR RII and state cyberinfrastructure strategic plans. The objectives of the SC RII C2-enabled Research and Education program are to: (1) increase bandwidth and establish distance learning classrooms to more efficiently share knowledge in the fields of tissue biofabrication and cell biology; and (2) broaden the engagement of research centers, community colleges and minority-serving institutions in RII Track-1 and Track-2-supported activities.

Intellectual Merit
The proposed RII C2 initiative plans to build upon South Carolina EPSCoR/IDeA?s model for infusing research into predominantly undergraduate institutions. The research and education program is organized around two major topics of interest to South Carolina, Tissue Biofabrication and Cell Biology, and Agricultural and Biological Engineering.
The proposed activities would enhance South Carolina?s cyberinfrastructure in support of two active EPSCoR RII programs (RII Track-1: Tissue Biofabrication and RII Track-2: Cyberinfrastructure) and further develop capacity for inter-institutional collaborations in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) research and education. The proposed activities are aligned with institutional, state and research infrastructure improvement strategic plans. The proposal builds on South Carolina?s investment of over $6M in South Carolina Light Rail, a high-speed, high-capacity fiber optic network linking the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), Clemson University, and the University of South Carolina (USC). The activities build on C-Light, Clemson?s fiber optic backbone that extends between Atlanta and Charlotte, providing a physical, direct connection to high-speed, high-capacity research networks such as Internet2 and National Lambda Rail. The proposal also builds on the Palmetto State Providers Network, a major building block for reaching some of South Carolina?s 2- and 4-year colleges and universities.
Broader Impacts
With the participation of Benedict College and Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College in the SC RII-C2 project, South Carolina will increase the number of minority-serving institutions engaged in its portfolio of RII programs. Benedict College is located in Columbia, SC and is South Carolina's largest private HBCU with an enrollment of approximately 2,800 students, divided evenly between females and males. Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College has a minority enrollment of 1,638 students, comprising 59.7% of their total enrollment. To achieve South Carolina's diversity of workforce strategy, the SC EPSCoR/IDeA program has implemented a number of activities that increase access to research resources at the state's minority serving institutions. Faculty will gain access to enhanced collaborative teaching and research opportunities with colleagues and students across the state, nation and world. Curricula at all participating institutions will be enriched and diversified by sharing expertise and resources across institutional lines.

Significant progress in the STEM fields in South Carolina will require increased collaboration among predominately undergraduate institutions, historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and comprehensive research universities. Improved infrastructure and shared resources are required to enable collaborative efforts.  To this end, the South Carolina Inter- and Intra- Campus Cyber Connectivity (C2) award installed enhanced classrooms in five South Carolina institutions, including three HBCUs, and increased bandwidth at three.  The University of South Carolina is sponsoring two HBCU institutions for access to Internet 2 and providing access through its network. Institutions with upgraded cyber-infrastructure have committed to sustaining that connectivity after the grant funding has been expended. Each institution has a technical staff to maintain installed equipment.

The new technology driven classroom installed at Benedict College will allow students to virtually attend math courses offered by faculty at North Carolina State University and participate in many more programs such as research seminars in STEM areas run by the University of South Carolina and Clemson University.  The improved bandwidth and connection to Internet2 will enhance college-wide capacity for faster communication and allow the chemistry program to use supercomputing for teaching and research.

Twenty of the twenty-three courses scheduled since Fall 2012 in the installed enhanced classroom at Claflin University are STEM courses.  The STEM courses include Immunology, Microbiology, and Differential Equations. The classroom is also used for research seminar presentations.

Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College invested in a distance learning center, which is connected to all sixteen colleges in the South Carolina Technical Education System, to bring virtual classroom and video conferencing capabilities to the campus.  The increased bandwidth provided by the grant supports current programs and services utilizing the center and will benefit a partnership with South Carolina State University.  An NSF grant
will utilize web servers at the Technical College, and the videoconferencing center will be used for guest speakers in physics courses.  Remote speakers will present from Clemson, MUSC, the University of South Carolina as well as other universities around the country.

The enhanced classroom, increased bandwidth, and connection to Internet2 at South Carolina State University (SCSU) will be used to offer courses in the new Master of Bioengineering Sciences (MBES) program which was recently established.  The MBES will support interdisciplinary STEM education and broaden participation in biotechnology and biomedicine to provide a pathway which will bridge SCSU students to PhD programs.  Courses such as Histology, Bioinformatics, Tissue Engineering, and Human Anatomy have been developed for the program and will be collaboratively distance-delivered with the University of South Carolina, Clemson University, and the Medical University of South Carolina.

This two-year $2.3M project will leverage ~$11M in funding and gratis contributions to broadly support the U.S. research, engineering, and educational community and its international collaborators. The project is named the Taj in honor of the significant contributions from the Tata Corporation in India.  By dramatically improving network infrastructure around the northern hemisphere, the Taj program promises far-reaching and sustainable benefits in global research and education (R&E) collaboration. The Taj will serve nearly every science discipline and offer a user-focused, performance-based network responsive to demands of a globally integrated, infrastructure aware community of scientists, engineers, teachers, and students. It will enable global open science collaboration in an era of constrained resources via carefully organized collaboration and co-funding with public and private sectors in Europe and Asia. The Taj program is new, yet it efficiently builds on the GLORIAD network infrastructure which connects U.S., China, and Russia, as well as Korea, Canada, Netherlands and the five Nordic countries.

The Taj will connect the exchange points in Hong Kong, Singapore, Mumbai, Alexandria (Egypt), and Europe, extending U.S. access to India, Egypt, & SE Asia, including likely connections to Vietnam and possibly North & East Africa.  It expands U.S.-China connection through the Pacific by a factor of 4, to 10 Gbps, offering greater capacity for U.S. collaborations with India and across SE Asia, and providing new equipment to enable better deployment of hybrid services for more advanced science applications.  The Taj will deploy a new high-capacity circuit connecting the U.S. with Greenland and the 5 Nordic countries, serving polar, climate change, cyberinfrastructure and other research, and expand U.S.-Russia capacity through a proposed Nordic infrastructure to St. Petersburg.  This network promises a new model of distributed, decentralized network measurement, security and management tools, and software for newly-connected India & SE Asia, and for existing communities in U.S., Asia, and Europe. This model enables easy sharing of global network management tasks and focuses on user-level performance.
 
Intellectual Merit: The Taj program advances global cyberinfrastructure services and metrics, broadens the global community working on measuring and mitigating customer-based infrastructure performance, and introduces a new model of distributed, decentralized management of cyberinfrastructure resources. The additional connectivity and bandwidth will allow greater access to cutting edge research in India and SE Asia, and will advance research in pragmatic network deployments and operations. The performance tools that will be deployed are extensible and novel in approach, and have the possibility to strongly impact R&E network deployments.

Broader Impacts: Taj's greatest impact lies in its contributions to Infrastructure for Research and Education. India and SE Asia alone will dramatically expand the current user base of 9 million R&E host systems logged by GLORIAD, and significant user growth worldwide. The Taj expansion will benefit U.S. and global research by bringing some of the world's brightest minds into the advanced networks R&E arena. The decentralized model for managing global cyber-infrastructure resources is Taj's most important legacy.  Taj is built upon a long track record of fostering global partnerships between public-private entities that address major science problems such as Climate Change, Cybersecurity, Early Warning Systems, Global Public Health, Renewable and Alternative Energy.

Overarching goals: strengthen cyberinfrastructure in the northern hemisphere; broaden U.S. access to under-served science communities; promote distributed, decentralized, secure approach to network management; improve operations and user experience through solid metrics for utilization, performance and security; improve cyberinfrastructure awareness and proficiency of end-users.

This project is jointly supported by the NSF's Office of Cyberinfrastructure and Office of International Science and Engineering, the Tata Communications, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Nordic Research Council.

87,"The project is developing an infrastructure for visualizing the real-time state of software system security. Information visualization exploits aspects of the human perceptual system to recognize salient facts, correlations, and features of a complex information space. By presenting visualizations in real time, allows users to relate system security to their own actions, and thereby gain a deeper understanding of how security can be enhanced-or compromised-as a part of their experience of using computer systems. Visualization offers a means by which one can incorporate information about system security into all aspects of computer system use. This is critically important since the security of information in a networked computer system depends on the interrelationships between many different systems, components, and applications; there is no one point of control. Any successful approach must be comprehensive.
A concern with security is not with mathematical abstraction but with practical reality. There is a disparity between theoretical security and effective security in day-to-day computing. Theoretical security is the level of information security one can achieve in theory, using strong encryption, zero-knowledge systems, and the current state of the art. On the other hand, effective security is the actual level of information security one can achieve in practice. A system can have high theoretical security but low effective security when the security mechanisms are implemented in ways that confuse or confound users.
In his classic article ""Why Cryptosystems Fail,"" Ross Anderson (1993) outlines two paradigms for system security. One is the ""automation"" paradigm, in which the work of managing information security is automated and embedded in the machinery of the system. The other is the ""facilitation"" paradigm, in which humans can monitor and managing the security process, adapting it to changing needs and circumstances. He argues that many security failures have their roots in the inherent brittleness of the dominant automation paradigm. However, for regular users, the design of conventional applications and interfaces systematically undermines the facilitation approach. The proposed research addresses this problem with an approach to visualizing system security. This work is not simply applying usability principles to security applications; rather, it is about making security a part of the regular user experience.
This work builds on the investigators' existing explorations in system architecture, software system visualization, and end-user understandings of security. The combination of these, however, yields an infrastructure that is not only technological novel but also holds significant promise for making the growing cyber-infrastructure accessible and secure for everyday use. On a scientific level, this research makes novel contributions in four areas: the mental models of Internet users, the use of visualization technologies for software system monitoring, the use of event architectures for interactive systems, and the relationship between user models and system architecture. In addition the project will develop an experimental infrastructure that the research community can exploit for research into interactive visualization and security. At a broader level, this research offers significant benefits to society at large. The impact of the Internet as a cultural and economic phenomenon is hard to overstate, and yet the current mechanisms that support users' secure exchange of information are brittle. A resolution to this problem is pressing, and is the goal of this research.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE","141 Innovation, Ste 250",Irvine,US,,CA45,University of California-Irvine,CA,926173213,47.070,['David  Redmiles'],09/02/2003,046705849,600000,08/31/2007,4900,ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS,600000,0326105,071549000,Paul  Dourish,"141 Innovation, Ste 250",Irvine,US,,CA45,University of California-Irvine,CA,926173213,jpd@ics.uci.edu,Paul,Dourish,,9498248127,mzemanko@nsf.gov,Maria Zemankova,7032928930,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,"['Dourish, P.~What We Talk About When We Talk About Context~Personal and Ubiquitous Computing~8~2004~19~~~0~ ~0~ ~04/11/2016 04:03:08.40000000', 'Fisher, D. and Dourish, P.~Social and Temporal Structures in Everyday Collaboration.~Proc.

88,"Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) has built the first-ever fully-functional campus microgrid on its Chicago Main Campus. Massive and rich data produced by this unique live laboratory are invaluable assets for the research community to enable further innovation in critical energy systems. However, data science in the energy systems faces demanding challenges, such as inadequate data processing speed, heterogeneous and error-prone data source, and strong real-time performance requirement. To enable research to address those challenges, this project will build a research infrastructure IDES (Integrated Data analytics for Energy Systems) to integrate high-performance computing power, in terms of both hardware and software, with the existing campus microgrid facility to meet the requirements of big data processing and analytics in energy systems.

IDES will be the first big data research infrastructure that integrates with a functioning smart microgrid. IDES consists of network devices, an integrated computer/file server cluster for high-performance data processing and storage, as well as a software-defined networking-based microgrid communication cyber-infrastructure. The project will enable the IIT microgrid to serve as a living laboratory, not only to advance power grid technologies but also to advance the big data analytics and cyber-security technologies. The project will also establish a partnership among power system researchers, computer scientists, electric utilities, IT support organizations, and other industrial partners to build a high-performance infrastructure for big data analytics in energy systems. In addition, the project will train students with the much-needed skills in high-performance data processing, microgrid, networking and cyber-security.

89,"This project investigates novel approaches to promote reliable networked microgrid operations in the face of various cyber and physical disturbances. Power distribution grid resiliency is a challenging problem with significant economic and security impacts that has been exacerbated in recent years by the increase in extreme weather events and cyber threats. Recently, networked microgrids have become an emerging paradigm that demonstrates resiliency benefit to their local customers. However, lack of awareness of stability margin, inadequate capability to respond to grid disturbances, and vulnerabilities to communication failure, delay, and cyber-attacks can undermine the capability of networked microgrids to improve distribution grid resiliency. 

The research project will create and implement networked microgrids solutions on a novel cyber infrastructure to ensure distribution grid resiliency. This cyber infrastructure is based on Software-Defined Networking. Specifically, the project has three main objectives: (1) To establish a formal analysis method to tractably assess networked microgrid stability; (2) To devise a new concept of microgrid active fault management (AFM) enabled through online distributed optimization; and (3) To build a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) based architecture to enable highly resilient networked microgrids. The project will contribute new formal analysis theories for deeper understanding of microgrid stability under high levels of renewable generation. The idea of integrating distributed optimization and power electronic control will pave the way for building grid-friendly networked microgrids, significantly contributing to grid resiliency. The novel SDN-based architecture and techniques will open the door for innovations in devising secure, reliable, and fault-tolerant algorithms for managing resilient networked microgrids and active distribution networks. Overall, the proposed new model-based and data-intensive technologies together will provide scalable, dependable and intelligent solutions to otherwise intractable problems in integrating complex networked microgrids. Building on the team's successes in minority student recruitment and undergraduate education and leveraging existing resources, the education plan targets underrepresented minorities and pre-college students to contribute to the preparation of the next-generation workforce in power engineering.

90,"The Just-in-Time-Teaching with Interactive Frequent Formative Feedback (JiTTIFFF or JTF) project uses engagement, assessment, and reflection tools developed in a prior NSF project and adapts them to an interactive cyber-enabled web environment. Using the tools in and out of class has the potential to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of learning using frequent formative feedback to students. New strategies include: 1) instruction informed by a multi-level, assessment-driven frequent formative feedback loops; 2) formative feedback from pre-class class preparation problems, 3) feedback during in-class engagement activities; 4) next class feedback discussion on confusing points from the previous class and 5) contextualization of activities and assessments with real-world applications. Compared to lecture-based pedagogy, constructivist pedagogy: increased average conceptual gain (measured by the Materials Concept Inventory) from 18% to 42%; increased class persistence from 85% to 95%; and decreased female withdrawal rate from 40% to 10%.  The web environment facilitates ease of implementation and creates the potential for broad dissemination of instructional strategies and tools developed. The project is also investigating issues in implementation and how instructors use assessment results to adjust instruction. Such knowledge and insight is shaping the development of tutorials, workshops, webinars and you-tube videos for instruction for faculty interested in adapting the JTF pedagogy in their own instruction. The JTF pedagogy is being implemented and assessed in four settings with diverse populations: Arizona State University,  North Carolina A&T, Oregon Institute of Technology, and Oregon State University. 

This project is producing 1) an updated sets of instructional resources in the web-based JTF Learning Tool Kit; 2) an understanding of the barriers and benefits of JTF implementation in diverse settings; 3) an understanding of how instructors use results of multi-level assessment to adjust instruction to address student learning issues; and 4) an assessment of the impact of JTF on student attitude, learning and retention, and differences arising from use in different settings and diverse populations. It is also investigating the potential for broad application of the general features of JTF strategies and tools in other engineering domains through dissemination and diffusion of JTF strategies, findings, and products to a wide audience. This study is informing the engineering education community of the potential for use of the types of JTF strategies and learning tools in other engineering domains. This project is testing the effectiveness of the JTF pedagogy in different settings with diverse populations when implemented on the cyber-enabled web platforms",NSF,4900,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,Corvallis,US,Corvallis,OR04,Oregon State University,OR,973318507,47.076,['Brady J Gibbons'],08/20/2012,053599908,79999,08/31/2015,4900,TUES-Type 2 Project,79999,1225456,053599908,Milo D Koretsky,,Corvallis,US,Corvallis,OR04,Oregon State University,OR,973312702,koretsm@engr.orst.edu,Milo,Koretsky,D,5417374591,kcrosby@nsf.gov,Karen Crosby,7032924629,040106 NSF Education & Human Resource,"We provide the Outcomes for Oregon State UniversityÆs (OSU) role in the NSF funded JTF project led by Steve Krause at Arizona State University (ASU). The overall project includes participants from four universities to use engagement, assessment, and reflection tools developed in an earlier ASU project and to adapt the tools to an interactive cyber-enabled web environment. At OSU, six different instructors in five unique courses used these tools. We have incorporated them into our home built Concept Warehouse to provide cyber-infrastructure for them to be used more broadly in the engineering education community. We helped develop and deliver two national workshops to show faculty the value of using these tools and how they could use the computer-enabled infrastructure we have developed.

Classroom assessment techniques that ask students to think back and reflect on material covered in class have been shown to help improve learning by allowing the student to actively participate in the learning process while evaluating their understanding of course content. Promoting students to be more reflective about their learning experiences allows them to develop robust learning strategies and metacognitive skills that are characteristic of experts. StudentsÆ written reflections can also provide instructors with formative information about students conceptions of course content and help instructors more effectively deliver instruction.

Intellectual Merit: the Concept Warehouse site usage was enhanced so that faculty could more effectively deliver reflection activities. An example ""Muddiest Point"" exercise is shown along with a newly built-in Word Cloud feature for a quick analysis of the most significant Muddiest Points for a given class. Several other features were incorporated to enhance use including a calendar function which allows instructors to set up classes for the full semester ahead of time and a LMI interface and mobile phone apps for ease of student use. Automating Muddy Point data collection and analysis has been shown to encourage greater faculty participation for diagnosing student learning issues and adjusting instruction to address them.

A crossover study was performed to compare two types of reflection activities Muddiest Point (""What was the muddiest point in class today/this week?"") and Most Surprised (""Describe what surprised you most in class today/this week""). We performed a study where we empirically investigated studentsÆ in-class responses to each prompt. Our research design allowed us to compare the resulting student reflections based on the same content and coverage. Word count data and thematic codes and were obtained from the collected responses. It appears that each prompt has benefits. The Muddiest Point is more familiar to students and directly asks students to identify concepts that are confusing.  However, Most Surprised doesnÆt necessarily have a negative connotation and can provide opportunity for students to reflect on and express their successes. So what should an instructor do? Of course, the answer depends on context. One response could be to do both, taking advantage of the affordances of each. Based on the findings and analysis, we developed an alternative that provides students the opportunity to select for themselves Muddiest Point, Most Surprised, or both (shown). Such a strategy provides authorship to the student. It also allows an alternative prompt to those students who wish to express a positive outlook. If the class size is large enough, as the case we studied, the instructor should have sufficient Muddiest Point responses to directly identify unclear and confusing content, but also the broader pedagogical and affective responses seen in Most Surprised.

Broader Impact: Since the Reflection Activity tool was implemented in June 2013, there have been over 2,000 students who have recorded over 20,000 reflection responses. This tool has impacted learning of students in materials science, t...",,"[""Bill J. Brooks, Debra M. Gilbuena, Stephen J. Krause, and Milo D.

91,"The objective of the project is to develop a comprehensive, integrated data management system for the NSF-funded Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) program, called CZOData. The overall goal for CZOData is to support, empower, and broaden the impact of CZO science and maximize the return on investment of the CZO program by transforming capabilities to easily share, integrate, analyze and preserve the wide range of multi-disciplinary data generated within and across CZOs. 

The CZOData design is based on the experience of the collaborative project team in building the current CZOData prototype and on other foundational cyber-infrastructure systems.  The principal investigators at the University of Boulder and the Stroud Water Research Center are Earth surface scientists who provided high-level oversight of the CZOData prototype and provide a direct link to the scientific community collecting and using CZO data.  Team members at San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC) and Utah State University (USU) are primary developers of the Hydrological Information System (HIS) developed by the Consortium for the Advancement of Hydrological Sciences, Inc. (CUAHSI).  Team members at Columbia University developed and lead the Integrated Earth Data Applications (IEDA), Geoinformatics for Geochemistry (GfG), EarthChem and the System for Earth Sample Registration (SESAR) projects.  Team members at the Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington developed and maintain the Northwest Association for Ocean Observing Systems (NANOOS) Visualization System (NVS).  

This project combines state-of-the-art computer science and cyber-infrastructure technologies and international metadata standards with a strong effort to engage the science community in the process of developing and testing the CZOData system.  This collaborative, community-based approach to developing scientific cyber-infrastructure has been actively encouraged by the NSF-supported EarthCube initiative and thus complements those goals (http://www.nsf.gov/geo/earthcube/). The approach with CZOData is based on integrating site-based data with system capabilities' such as consistent data publication, cataloguing, discovery and access infrastructure. These new capabilities will strongly leverage other CI efforts described above. The resulting system will support new CZO research that was not possible before while easing the data management burden on CZO scientists.

The vision is that the proposed CZOData will serve as a model for the greater Earth surface science community. The CZOData project is a collaborative, community-guided cyber-infrastructure project for integrating multi-disciplinary data and providing interoperability with other systems. Thus, CZOData will inform the development of other large geoinformatics initiatives, such a the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), Long-Term Environmental Research (LTER) observatories, DataOne, OpenTopography, the Implementing Organization of the International Geosample Number (IGSN e.v.), and the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS).

This project proposal focuses on autonomic computing and systems, applicable to the important areas of security, fault management, and data centers. Planned are the prototypes to be deployed on test bed environments driven by the requirements from industry. The most interesting part of the proposal are applications to SCADA environments, which integrate monitoring, multi-level behavior analysis, decision fusion and risk analysis relative to security of SCADA environments. Other areas include autonomic peer-to-peer systems, as well as study related to the data centers, both at the application layer and data center hardware, where focus is on robustness.

The successful completion of this project will represent a significant step toward the design and deployment of highly secure SCADA systems and networks. In addition to security, the autonomic detection of anomalies in applications or subsystems of a datacenter addresses inefficiencies in data center design by eliminating the dependence on over-provisioning, which is a resource-inefficient strategy for ensuring quality of service by trying to offset any sub-system failures and malfunctions.

The widespread use of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems in critical energy infrastructures (gas, oil, and electrical power) makes them vulnerable to both internal and external attacks. To make the matter even worse, SCADA systems were never designed with security in mind and securing them is a challenging research problem. Consequently, SCADA networks become a prime target for cyber attacks due to the profound and catastrophic impacts they can inject to our economy and all aspects of our life.

SCADA systems can be viewed as distributed control systems where human operators control the environment through Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI). Through the HMI, the operators can control the SCADA subsystems that include Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs), Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). With the use of information technology in SCADA systems, they become susceptible to all cyber attacks that might control all SCADA programs from remote sites located on the Internet.  Current commercial intrusion detection and protection tools and techniques have failed to secure and protect our cyber infrastructure as we can tell from the frequent news of successful cyberattacks on our information systems and services. These techniques are based on signature based methods and cannot detect new and novel attacks.

An innovative approach based on autonomic computing technology that is analogous to the human nervous system where computing systems and applications can be self-configured, self-optimized, self-healed and self-protected with little involvement from the users and/or system administrators has been developed in this project by the University of Arizona Center for Autonomic Computing, AVIRTEK and Raytheon. To test and evaluate the self-protection algorithms, we have successfully implemented a critical infrastructure test-bed that is sponsored by Raytheon, AVIRTEK, and University of Arizona as shown in Figure 1. The main goal of the test-bed is to experiment with and evaluate the integration of Raytheon and AVIRTEK technologies and Autonomic agents developed at the Center to achieve the following objectives: 1) Autonomic control and management of different power generation technologies; 2) Integrate Raytheon technologies with AVIRTEK Autonomic Software Protection System (ASPS) and Autonomic agents to build the next generation of Autonomic Critical Infrastructure Protection (AutoCiP) system; and 3) Evaluate the autonomic protection strategies against cyber and physical attacks. The test-bed will be an invaluable resource to develop, experiment with and evaluate the security and protection functions and services.

With the assistance of Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) and a strong advisory board, the university developed a planning grant application that was funded in 2003 by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Data and partnerships obtained through this assessment and planning process were the foundation for the first implementation grant funded by NSF in 2005.  In that year, UAPB Student Information System showed STEM enrollment at 667, retention (1st to 2nd year) at 65.2% and the number of graduates at 82. Curricula upgrades, faculty development, student enrichment in terms of internships, group study, preparation and for presentations (oral and poster) at professional meetings along with a first-year residential summer academy, have combined to produce in 2014 STEM enrollment of 797; a retention rate 93.3% and 124 graduates.

Based on the success of the HBCU-UP STEM Academy and best practices learned, the Academy now serves as the lead institution for the NSF-funded Arkansas Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation which receives matching funds from the Arkansas Economic Development Commission - Science and Technology; has recently been awarded its third major NSF HBCU-UP Implementation Grant; and has received scholarships for three animal science majors through Bell Community Services, a regional 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. In response to continuous program growth, the STEM Academy and UAPB worked together to secure funding  for a new $10M STEM Building to house the STEM initiatives which opened in November 2014. Funding was received from the U.S. Department of Education, Title III Strengthening HBCU Program, Student Aid Fiscal Responsibility Act; then-Governor of Arkansas Mike Beebe; Arkansas Senator Linda Chesterfield; Arkansas Representative Charles Armstrong; St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church; Dr. Carolyn F. Blakely and the taxpayers of the State of Arkansas.

STEM Academy graduates are found in graduate and professional schools (e.g. Purdue University, Howard University, University of Texas Health Science Center and the University of Oklahoma which in 2015 awarded the Ph.D. in Chemistry to a STEM Scholar who was a member of the first UAPB HBCU-UP STEM Cohort (2005). STEM graduates have also entered the workforce at companies including Tyson, STANT, Datatronic, CIA, Microsoft and Proctor and Gamble.

The UAPB STEM Academy continues to partner with federal, state and local agencies to offer experiental and didactic STEM knowledge to a diverse group of students in the preparation of society's professional STEM workforce which is essential for the health, safety and well-being of the U.S. and global society.

As globally distributed research teams work more closely to solve complex problems utilizing high-performance cyberinfrastructure, from petascale computers to specialized instrumentation generating massive amounts of data, the need for high-resolution visualization is becoming more critical for analysis, and is propelling the worldwide adoption of ""OptIPortals"". An OptIPortal is an ultra-resolution visualization display instrument interconnected by optical networks that enables the creation of ""cyber-mashups,"" or juxtapositions, of data visualizations, enabling greater insight.  SAGE, the Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment, is cross-platform middleware that enables users worldwide to have a common operating environment, or framework, for accessing, streaming and juxtaposing high-resolution visualizations on one or more OptIPortals. This project will transition SAGE from a transformative research prototype to a hardened technology that provides production-quality, community-driven open services for visualization and collaboration utilizing shared national and international cyberinfrastructure, for the advancement of scientific research and education.

Intellectual Merit
Coping with complexity and scale in data is a problem that spans all of e-science. Using OptIPortals and SAGE, scientists can create visualization pipelines from multiple sources - whether supercomputers, data storage systems and/or instruments (such as high-definition cameras), as well as laptop screens and the Web - to access and share a variety of information, in a variety of resolutions and formats, and create giant Cyber-Mashups.

Broader Impact
Our Nation already invests in network-connected, middleware-enabled cyberinfrastructure to generate and disseminate petabytes (ultimately exabytes) of data among researchers worldwide. What is missing, however, is a globally integrated collaborative work environment to facilitate data analysis and high productivity. Funding to provide a production-quality SAGE will make cyberinfrastructure more accessible to broader communities of scientists and students, and help maintain US leadership in high-performance computing.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS,809 S MARSHFIELD,Chicago,US,Chicago,IL07,University of Illinois at Chicago,IL,606124305,47.070,"['Maxine D Brown', 'Andrew E Johnson', 'Luc  Renambot']",08/18/2009,098987217,1933337,08/31/2013,4900,STRATEGIC TECHNOLOGIES FOR CI,1933337,0943559,041544081,Jason  Leigh,809 S MARSHFIELD,Chicago,US,Chicago,IL07,University of Illinois at Chicago,IL,606124305,leighj@hawaii.edu,Jason,Leigh,,3123200981,iqualter@nsf.gov,Irene M.

First, to preserve and make accessible a unique video collection emanating from two decades of longitudinal research, funded by multiple NSF grants, of children learning mathematics.  The collection is unique in following the same students over time to trace the development of their mathematical ideas and forms of reasoning.  The videos feature one cohort of students across grades 1-12; a year-long study in a 4th grade classroom; and middle-school students in an urban, after-school setting.  The collection showcases learning mathematics in the domains of algebra, counting and combinatorics, fractions and probability.  The significant merits of this collection led to the second project purpose: to investigate how teachers study video episodes to learn about studentsÆ mathematical reasoning as participants in design research studies.  This report shares key project outcomes from Rutgers University researchers.

 

Researchers in mathematics education and the learning sciences collaborated with experts in digital library systems to create the Video Mosaic Collaborative (VMC) portal.  The VMC is a collection and collaboration portal within RUcore, a robust preservation and open access institutional repository, with a commitment to the long-term preservation of Rutgers scholarship and resources to the archival standard of 200+ years.  VMC management for preservation, access, authenticity and impact are incorporated into the ongoing workflow of the repository, thus insuring a sustainable portal that will continue to grow in impact with existing university staffing and resources.   300+ videos are openly available at VMC (www.videomosaic.org).  Videos were cataloged to an international metadata standard maintained by the Library of Congress, which enables sharing metadata and resources with other repositories and initiatives.  All videos receive DOIs for permanent citation and availability.  The project added robustness to the discovery of resources by education researchers through introducing new ontologies (specialized vocabularies) on mathematical reasoning, problems and tools, to incorporate the language of the domain into the discovery process,  an important outcome of this project. To enable research, teaching and collaboration, project personnel built a new technology tool, the RUAnalytic, which enables users to select video clips, edit and annotate them, and arrange those video events to construct a multimedia narrative.  Workspace is provided to VMC community members with a research or mathematics-education agenda, to support collaborative research and learning discoveries among members.  The multimedia narratives they create can undergo peer review and publication with metadata and a DOI for citation at the VMC portal (http://videomosaic.org/analytics/), for long-term impact as a contribution to scholarly discourse in the field. An important outcome of this project is a new form of scholarly publication where the research data and the analysis are tightly integrated and can exist alone or embedded in other works, such as electronic dissertations.

 

Researchers also conducted design studies to measure teacher learning as a result of participating in instructional activities, either a course or workshop series, in which they examined and discussed video episodes illustrating students engaged in mathematical problem solving. The videos afforded teachers an opportunity to notice students working collaboratively, using appropriate manipulative tools to build models, and reasoning about their own and their classmatesÆ mathematical ideas in classroom environments.

 

The design studies collected and analyzed pre- and post-assessment data on teachersÆ beliefs and their descriptions of childrenÆs mathematical reasoning from a video episode.

NDN offers a new networking paradigm that is very well-suited to address Big Data problems, by virtue of treating content as a first class entity and the use of extensive caching in the network to help disseminate large data quickly to collaborators. NDN also facilitates easy content discovery and provides inherent data integrity and provenance.

Our proposal is to create a small overlay of powerful NDN nodes at strategic locations (close to climate scientists) in large educational and research networks such as Internet 2 and ESNet. These nodes will run existing NDN software and will act as NDN routers.  We will adapt existing climate applications that require extensive network resources to operate over the NDN testbed.  This will enable experimentation using a climate modeling applications that generate enormous amounts of data from simulations, metadata and annotations and require efficient data sharing for analysis.  For NDN, the infrastructure will enable research into one of the hardest problems in NDN, naming, while providing operational experience with an application that will stress the architecture to its limits.

98,"The backbone of IT infrastructure is evolving towards a service-oriented model, in which distributed resources (software services, virtualized hardware infrastructure, data repositories, sensors, and network overlays) can be composed as a customized IT service on demand.  In particular, cloud computing infrastructure services manage a shared ``cloud'' of servers as a unified hosting substrate for diverse scientific applications, using various technologies to provision servers and orchestrate their operation.   At the same time, high-speed networks increasingly offer dynamic provisioning services at multiple layers.  Network-connected clouds offer a general, flexible, and powerful model to scale up computing power for data-intensive science applications running at multiple cloud sites. The software produced in this project offers interfaces and control policies for application-driven orchestration of federated clouds interconnected by advanced networks.

The project develops software to link cloud computing clusters to other cyberinfrastructure resources through dynamically provisioned networks.  A principal focus is to extend popular cloud infrastructure software with hooks to connect provisioned machine instances running in the cloud to external resources through dynamic circuit networks.   The project enables cloud applications to dynamically request compute resources at multiple points in the network, together with bandwidth-provisioned network pipes to interconnect them and link them with other services and data repositories.   The orchestration framework is based on the Open Resource Control Architecture (ORCA), an extensible platform for dynamic leasing of resources in a shared networked infrastructure.   The resource allocation policies are enabled through semantic resource descriptions and extended intelligent SPARQL queries. Driving applications for this project are MotifNetwork, IMG/JGI and Supernova Factory and sensor networks linked to cloud resources (CASA).

The testbed consists of a number of campus clouds  interconnected by programmable networks, like Internet2 (http://www.internet2.edu) and ESnet (http://www.es.net). These clouds are distributed across the US and the world and include computational, storage and network resource contributed by ExoGENI's  international partners.

The technologies developed in the ""Missing Link"" project are making it possible for experimenters - university students, faculty, researchers - to rapidly  create complex distributed ""virtual networks"" that support a variety of experiments in distributed systems and network science. The testbed also serves as a blueprint for developing the future architecture of widely-distributed cyber infrastructure spanning the globe, easily accessible by a multitude of researchers from different branches of science and helping them be more productive in their discovery. 

The included figures show what ExoGENI testbed looks like in the spring of 2014 - its deeply interconnected nature made possible by the ""Missing Link"" project and an example of an experiment run on ExoGENI that supports a complex application targeted at computational chemistry applications. 

One of the important outcomes of the project is the interest that the technologies enabling this type of rapid creation of on-demand cyber-infrastructure is getting from computational scientists struggling with configuring and running their computations on the traditional monolithic computational infrastructure. The ExoGENI technologies have deep implications to a number of sciences and sectors of industry struggling with the ""big data"" problems - astronomy, physics, chemistry, bio-informatics and healthcare.

99,"The backbone of IT infrastructure is evolving towards a service-oriented model, in which distributed resources (software services, virtualized hardware infrastructure, data repositories, sensors, and network overlays) can be composed as a customized IT service on demand.  In particular, cloud computing infrastructure services manage a shared ``cloud'' of servers as a unified hosting substrate for diverse scientific applications, using various technologies to provision servers and orchestrate their operation.   At the same time, high-speed networks increasingly offer dynamic provisioning services at multiple layers.  Network-connected clouds offer a general, flexible, and powerful model to scale up computing power for data-intensive science applications running at multiple cloud sites. The software produced in this project offers interfaces and control policies for application-driven orchestration of federated clouds interconnected by advanced networks.

The project develops software to link cloud computing clusters to other cyberinfrastructure resources through dynamically provisioned networks.  A principal focus is to extend popular cloud infrastructure software with hooks to connect provisioned machine instances running in the cloud to external resources through dynamic circuit networks.   The project enables cloud applications to dynamically request compute resources at multiple points in the network, together with bandwidth-provisioned network pipes to interconnect them and link them with other services and data repositories.   The orchestration framework is based on the Open Resource Control Architecture (ORCA), an extensible platform for dynamic leasing of resources in a shared networked infrastructure.   The resource allocation policies are enabled through semantic resource descriptions and extended intelligent SPARQL queries. Driving applications for this project are MotifNetwork, IMG/JGI and Supernova Factory and sensor networks linked to cloud resources (CASA).

The testbed also serves as a blueprint for developing the future architecture of widely distributed cyber-infrastructure spanning the globe, easily accessible by a multitude of researchers from different branches of science and helping them be more productive in their discovery.

One of the important outcomes of the project is the interest that the technologies enabling this type of rapid creation of on&shy;-demand cyber-infrastructure is getting from computational scientists struggling with configuring and running their computations on the traditional monolithic computational infrastructure.

100,"Growing renewable generation capacity is leading to unprecedented variability and uncertainty in power system operations, and a lack of power system flexibility threatens further increases in global sustainability in electricity sectors across the globe.  This project seeks to aggregate and control demand-side resources to provide this flexibility through a distributed control framework that is robust to failures in cyber-infrastructure, and is scalable across institutional dynamics, energy markets, and levels of power system development infrastructure.  Research objectives in this proposal will advance current applications and theories in computing, modeling and control, and the effectiveness and scalability of this work will be rigorously demonstrated through a field trial in Nicaragua.   This project will result in new tools to facilitate sustainable energy systems throughout the globe, an open data platform that strengthens the ability of global researchers to develop global solutions to challenges underling the integration of renewable sources, and advances in education to equip the workforce with new tools to tackle sustainability challenges.   

The envisioned system employs a centralized computing infrastructure to produce optimal control laws for individual thermostatically controlled loads.  The control laws can operate with or without reliable cyber-infrastructure in real time; in the absence of cyber-infrastructure, control can be based on time of use and local frequency measurements only.   Control laws will be published by a central server and periodically accessed by local intelligence at each load.  Challenges to this work include creating computing infrastructure that can actively distribute control laws and validate participation, modeling and control methods that are effective on real-world loads, and identifying control strategies with effective incentive mechanisms for consumers to participate.  At the conclusion of the project the investigators will have: (1) built a framework by which an innovative, cloud-based data management platform called Mezuri can robustly track the provenance and processing of all data and disseminate control laws; (2) developed hierarchical statistical models for state estimation and prediction of large fleets of thermally controlled loads that directly include the effects of human behavior, and adapt models to require as few observations as possible; and (3) devised new stochastic optimal control formulations that account for human activity and accommodate both system- and local-level objectives.

101,"This project upgrades the campus network for Juniata College to 10Gbps and establishes a connection to Internet2 via 3ROX. Juniata College hosts a high capacity compute cluster for a consortium of undergraduate institutions working in genomics research. The Genome Consortium for Active Teaching, using high throughput Next Generating Sequencing (GCAT-SEEK), provides sequencing technologies and genomic analysis training to faculty and students to support on-going research projects at 132 partnering institutions. Campus networking improvements enable greater end-to-end performance and reliability for students and research users of the compute cluster, and improves network-based access to central resources for computational biology required for research projects involving analysis and comparison of whole genome data sets. The expanded network is an essential advancement as it allows teams of faculty and students to participate in cutting-edge genomics research projects and provide authentic research experiences to undergraduates at the partnering institutions. The increased network capacity enhances undergraduate classroom teaching, enabling students from multiple institutions to simultaneously access the software and computational resources of the compute cluster. The cyber infrastructure improvements include the expansion of the internal local area network (LAN), an increase in Internet2 connectivity, and connections to resources within larger frameworks at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. This strategy presents a financially-feasible model for increased Internet2 connectivity that may be adopted by other small institutions.

Thompson,7032928970,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Computational resources including communication bandwidth have not kept pace with the growth in the size of NGS datasets in genomics research. Juniata College?s Collaborative Science Infrastructure (CSI) project upgraded the institution?s network infrastructure to greatly increase connectivity speeds, which has allowed us to expand the performance and reliability of the genomics compute cluster and network used by GCAT-SEEK. This was an essential advancement, since small colleges and universities - which provide an undergraduate education for many American scientists - need consortiums such as GCAT-SEEK in order to participate in cutting-edge genomics research activities and to provide authentic research experiences to undergraduates. This cyberinfrastructure improvement has facilitated the ability of GCAT-SEEK members to advance the fields of RNAseq, prokaryotic genomics, eukaryotic genomics, and metagenomics using computational biology and its required high bandwidth interconnectivity. The infrastructure improvements in the CSI project included significant increases in the capacity of the internal LAN replacing 1 Gigabits per second (Gbps) maximum uplinks with 10 Gbps maximum uplinks, an increase in potential Internet capacity, a connection to 3ROX within the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, and a 1 Gbps connection to Internet2.  These CSI project improvements were comprised of a financially-feasible model that may be adopted by other small institutions. Juniata College?s Campus Technology Services Department, under the leadership of Anne Wood, Assistant Vice President and Chief Information Officer, designed the CSI cyberinfrastructure upgrade plan and closely collaborated with the PIs, Dr. Jill Keeney from the Biology Department and Dr. Loren Rhodes from Information Technology/Computer Science Department, to ensure that the resulting network was feasible, sustainable, and addressed the needs of Juniata College scientists and the GCAT-SEEK consortium.

The infrastructure enhancements increased the networking capability of 132 partnering undergraduate institutions in the GCAT-SEEK consortium as well as Allegheny Branch American Society for Microbiology members. The improved network now provides a framework for building collaborative interactions between institutions and disciplines, and will continue to stimulate research and teaching throughout the consortium. This improved cyberinfrastructure for GCAT-SEEK allows the consortium to keep pace with the computational needs of its members and to continue to train future scientists and engineers.

As an example of end-user improved capacity since the infrastructure and connectivity upgrades were put into place, the summer 2017 GCAT-SEEK workshop in Hampton Virginia permitted the two main breakout sessions to remotely connect to the Juniata genomics compute cluster with about 20 participants plus 5 instructors simultaneously. This marked improved access compares to limited support in prior years to only one main breakout session with about 10 participants plus instructors. In addition to the summer workshop, we have seen increased usage throughout our academic year due to the improved capacity. 

Prior to the CSI project award and implementation, for the 2-month period of 1/11/14 to 3/11/14, the total data transferred to and from the GCAT-SEEK server and the HHMI cluster as exhibited in the first supporting image was: 

2.56 Terabits or 320 GBytes outbound from GCAT-SEEK and HHMI cluster to outside sources.
1.83 Terabits or 230 GBytes inbound from outside sources to the GCAT-SEEK and HHMI cluster.


After the CSI project implementation, for the 1.5-month period of 10/15/17 to 11/28/17, the total data transferred to and from the GCAT-SEEK server and the HHMI cluster as exhibited in the second supporting image was: 

11.9 Terabits or 1487.5 GBytes outbound from GCAT-SEEK and HHMI cluster to other sources.
17.7 Terabits or 2212.5 GBytes inbound from other sources to the GCAT-SEEK and HHMI cluster.


Juniata instructors note that up to 100 simultaneous users can now routinely access the cluster. The uploading files on the order of terabytes is now feasible without delivering hard drives containing the data, facilitating a much more rapid analysis of the datasets.

Infrastructure improvements have supported the exposure of undergraduates to model-based scientific inquiry and enhanced undergraduate learning. Network improvements have enhanced undergraduate classroom teaching, and has the potential to enable hundreds of students from multiple institutions to simultaneously use software on Juniata College?s genomics compute cluster. Juniata College is disseminating its model for genomics sequencing in undergraduate education to minority-serving institutions, which makes these opportunities more available to underrepresented populations. This will result in an increase in scientists able to generate, analyze, and interpret genomic data and will help pave the way toward a genomics-literate society. Additional impacts of GCAT-SEEK activities include studies of the broader ethical, legal, and social implications of genomics. The need to address these issues is critical for training the next generation of scientists, physicians, and healthcare policy experts.

102,"Cloud data centers have become an important cyber-infrastructure vital to our society and economy, yet the virtualization infrastructure is prone to many reliability challenges. In a cloud, the virtualization infrastructure presents an abstraction layer on top of commodity hardware components and manages the execution of guest virtual machines (VMs). However, commodity computer systems are susceptible to hardware errors and expected to experience high error rates in the near future. Notably, a hardware error in a virtualized system can potentially result in a system crash, breaking the assumption of VM fault isolation. This reliability risk is further compounded by the massive scale of data centers hosting hundreds of thousands of servers as well as the pursuit of aggressive server consolidation that aims to host hundreds of VMs on each single server for high resource utilization. Traditional VM fault tolerant solutions are inadequate to address this challenge.

This research proposes a hardware error resilient virtualization infrastructure that provides high-performance virtualization during error free execution while offering strong protection against hardware errors. This research will advance our understanding of hardware error behaviors in virtualized environments and develop virtualization-aware techniques that provide robust error detection, recovery, and protection. The proposed hardware error resilient virtualization infrastructure will offer a low-cost full system solution by taking advantage of the characteristics of virtualized systems and providing resource management mechanisms for balanced performance and reliability.

The proposed virtualization infrastructure, if successful, will bring substantial benefits to cloud providers in delivering reliable services to millions of users.

Proposal Title:	Infrastructure to Advance Life Sciences in the Ocean State

Institution:		University of Rhode Island

The Rhode Island Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) program focuses on cutting edge research to understand how marine biological organisms are affected by variations in their surroundings due to climate change effects. The goals of the project are to advance Rhode Island's competitiveness in marine life science, foster collaboration among researchers and educators in the state, and build diverse, well-trained workforce teams involving nine institutions of higher education across the state. This project is regionally relevant, nationally significant, takes advantage of unique Rhode Island resources including the Narragansett Bay, and aligns well with the state Science and Technology plan.

Intellectual Merit
A number of studies predict that with ocean warming and acidification, many single and multiple cell organisms will be under stress whereas many pathogenic microbes and parasites will thrive. The resilience of marine organisms to climate change will depend crucially on acclimation and adaptation. The Rhode Island RII program is aimed at understanding, predicting, and mitigating the impacts of environmental stresses on marine organisms and ecosystems. These studies are fundamentally important to the global biosphere (and locally to Narragansett Bay) as nutrient cycles and sustained biological production in the ocean, ultimately determine the availability of seafood. The investigations focus on key individual organisms (e.g., fish, plankton, marine pathogens), food webs, and the spread of infection and disease among marine host populations. The studies will explore how these species are affected by changes in chemical and physical parameters in the ocean such as temperature, acidity, and nutrient availability. Through these activities, the researchers at Rhode Island will be well positioned to make significant intellectual contribution to the assessment of climate change effects on marine organisms and ecosystems.

Broader Impacts
The infrastructure improvements for life sciences research and education and the partnership among public and private institutions of higher education including two- and four-year colleges will assist in building Rhode Island's research capacity. The Rhode Island EPSCoR Academy will coordinate efforts to foster collaboration among diverse institutions, broaden participation to increase diversity, and engage students at all levels in research and educational training. Fellowships for students and programs aimed at increasing the participation of under-represented minority groups are included in this RII project. A unique aspect of this project is the involvement of Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) for interdisciplinary collaboration among scientists and RISD artists and designers. This interaction is expected to enable the development of improved tools and strategies for the visualization and communication of complex scientific information to K-12 students and non-traditional audiences. In addition, collaborations with the University of Rhode Island's Metcalf Institute will enhance science communication by strengthening interaction among scientists, students, and journalists.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND,RESEARCH OFFICE,KINGSTON,US,Kingston,RI02,University of Rhode Island,RI,028811967,47.083,"['Edward  Hawrot', 'Charlie P Cannon']",08/13/2010,144017188,20000000,12/31/2017,4900,EPSCoR Research Infrastructure,21440481,1004057,075705780,Geoffrey D Bothun,RESEARCH OFFICE,KINGSTON,US,Kingston,RI02,University of Rhode Island,RI,028811967,gbothun@uri.edu,Geoffrey,Bothun,D,4018749518,skennan@nsf.gov,"Kennan, Sean C.",7032927575,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The Rhode Island NSF EPSCoR Track-I award ""Infrastructure to Advance Life Sciences in the Ocean State"" addressed the impacts of climate change on coastal environments through research, workforce development, and outreach. Rhode Island is defined physically, culturally and economically by Narragansett Bay. Its extensive coastline, varied marine and estuarine environments, diversity of organisms, and location at the juncture of two distinct marine climatic regions make the Bay a natural laboratory for marine life sciences research.

The University of Rhode Island was the lead institution, partnering with Brown University, the Community College of Rhode Island, and the primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) Bryant University, Rhode Island College, the Rhode Island School of Design, Roger Williams University, and Salve Regina University. Rhode Island NSF EPSCoR enhanced research capacity and workforce development within the state by supporting research and education teams in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM); building core instrument facilities across partner institutions; training undergraduate and graduate students in science and science communication; and engaging K-12 students in discovery and learning. 

The vision that drove Rhode Island?s NSF EPSCoR program was the desire to become, and be recognized as, an international leader in understanding and predicting the response of marine organisms and marine ecosystems to climate variability. With the ongoing state and federal investments, Rhode Island used molecular and cellular techniques, cyber infrastructure, computational biology, pioneering visualization techniques, and interdisciplinary approaches to advance knowledge about the interaction of climate variability with the evolution of marine communities and their connection to the watersheds. Our mission was to provide a platform to promote collaboration and cooperation among the Rhode Island?s institutions of higher education, to interconnect research and the student learning experience, and to enable alignment of our efforts with the needs of the state to increase research competitiveness nationally, especially in marine life science and affiliated fields of study.

This $21.4 million Track-I award, coupled with state investments exceeding $5.4 million, were used to build interdisciplinary teams that bridged multiple Rhode Island NSF EPSCoR institutions to addressing the following research questions. What are the stress responses and evolutionary potentials of marine organisms in response to climate change? How are the structure and function of coastal marine food webs and biogeochemical cycling being redirected in response to climate change? How does global climate change affect the ecology of marine pathogens and parasites? The intellectual merit of our achievements are showcased by the more than 200 publications in scientific journals and 24 graduate student dissertations. Communities, businesses and industries across the state benefitted from RI EPSCoR research on carbon sequestration of wetlands, the value of shoreline restoration, proliferation of algal blooms, and development of new tools to combat aquaculture disease. Going forward, this body of work contributed to the framework to inform policy makers as they prepare for the impact of climate change.

Research, education, and outreach activities were supported by Rhode Island NSF EPSCoR core facilities, which continue to operate. At the University of Rhode Island, the Genomics and Sequencing Center facilitates interdisciplinary genomics research and student training opportunities by providing researchers access to cutting-edge technologies in the field of genomics. The Marine Science Research Facility provides state-of-the-art laboratories for rearing and maintaining a variety of marine organisms and for performing chemical, physical and molecular analysis of samples. At Brown University, the Center for Computational Visualization provides scientific and technical computing expertise to advance computational research. The Proteomics Shared Resource Facility provides state-of-the-art instrumentation and fundamental proteomics expertise. And at the Rhode Island School of Design, the Nature Lab offers advanced imaging systems that give users access to living and non-living specimens. The facilities have been acknowledged by 421 publications over the lifetime of the award.

Our Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF) provided scientific and career development training to 237 students from Rhode Island NSF EPSCoR institutions. Training and mentoring was also provided to 34 graduate students through our Graduate Fellowship program. Many of our undergraduate SURF students continued their education in graduate programs at Rhode Island NSF EPSCoR institutions, providing a pipeline to advanced training that supports our state economy through a STEAM-skilled workforce. Our hope is that this pipeline becomes further seeded in the future through our K-12 outreach efforts, where K-12 students were exposed to research activities throughout Rhode Island NSF EPSCoR through hands-on field trips and classroom activities.

This award has led to transformational changes across the state that continue to build research capacity. This includes STEM workforce development at Rhode Island PUIs; partnerships between Rhode Island NSF EPSCoR and the Rhode Island National Institutes of Health Idea Network for Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) to support student training and career development, and to expand core research infrastructure; and collaboration with the Metcalf Institute for Marine and Environmental Reporting to build science literacy and communication skills.

Title: 	IAD: Rsch & Educ Infr for Enabling Autonomic Sensor Grid Systems in Multidisciplinary Applications

Project Proposed:

This project, acquiring infrastructure to enable autonomic sensor grid systems (ASGS), integrates two emerging technologies, wireless sensor networks and grid computing. The large-scale sensor network and grid computing platform service the following research projects:
.	High-Throughput Networking Protocols;
.	An Autonomic Sensor Grid System Framework;
.	Collaborative Dynamic Tracking and Information Processing;
.	Intrusion Detection; and
.	Enabling Multidisciplinary Applications.
The first project investigates techniques to enhance dynamic sensor network throughput while contributing to meet the emerging data intensive and high data rate requirements of many applications. The second designs, implements, and evaluates the ASGC framework that integrates sensor networks and grid computing technologies with self-managing capabilities providing self-managing middleware and user and programming interfaces for query, visualization, analysis, and physical discovery phenomena, and further command and control of actuators/robots for synergistic tasks in coordinated manners. The third develops high confidence coordination algorithms and tools for hybrid (static and motion-enabled) sensor networks and explores power-aware collaborative information processing techniques. The fourth investigates attack modeling and analysis, large-scale intrusion detection and tracing, and deceiving attackers' techniques. The fifth includes Precision Agriculture and Ranching, Protective Clothing, Vehicle Navigation, Homeland Security, Environmental Monitoring, and Rapid Disaster Recovery.

Broader Impacts: The infrastructure contributes in the development of new courses, recruiting under-represented/minority students, outreach and minority participation, and technology transfer to industry. The new courses include Cooperative Robotic Networks, Sensor Networks, Embedded Systems, and Grid Computing. Plans include involving Native Americans and Langston University, an HBCU. Moreover, the facility contributes to broaden education and research in an EPCSoR state. Precision agriculture in crop and livestock production appears to be an interesting and useful application for the state.",NSF,4900,OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY,101 WHITEHURST HALL,Stillwater,US,Stillwater,OK03,Oklahoma State University,OK,740781011,47.070,"['John B Solie', 'Rafael  Fierro', 'Venkatesh  Sarangan']",07/23/2007,049987720,298000,12/31/2012,4900,COMPUTING RES INFRASTRUCTURE,314000,0709329,049987720,Johnson  Thomas,101 WHITEHURST HALL,Stillwater,US,Stillwater,OK03,Oklahoma State University,OK,740781011,jpt@cs.okstate.edu,Johnson,Thomas,,4057445668,@nsf.gov,,,"490106 NSF,Education & Human Resource","We investigated issues in designing, implementing, and deploying cyber-physical systems. By real-world deployment in a farmland, we demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency using low-energy low duty cycle wireless sensor networks for enhancing precision agriculture. We deployed multiple wireless sensor nodes with a carrier frequency of 2.4GHz in an experimental wheat field to measure soil moisture, temperature, and electrical conductivity. A series of systematic field experiments were conducted during three complete winter wheat growth seasons from seeding to harvest. Models were developed to predict the path-loss of radio signals in the field during various growing stages. As one of the first real-world experiments, our experiences and experiments have opened significant opportunity in the state and beyond. To facilitate efficient data gathering in an irregular region (such as a large farmland), we designed an anchor-free SinkTrail protocol that minimizes data collection process in a realworld settings (e.g. a tractor following irregular trails in a land). The novel algorithm features naturally-formed virtual coordinates without relying on any landmarks or predefined locations. In related work, robots with sensors were deployed in a lab setting to measure the most effective sink-sensor combination. Leveraging support from NSF/GENI program, we further extend our sensor network testbed to the cloud and build the OKGems/GemsCloud (http://okgems.ece.ufl.edu/). OKGems provides a public cloud for research and experiments on the ceiling wireless sensornet grid and mobile robots in our lab. To support multi-site sensornets, we proposed MagicLink to seamlessly integrate multi-site sensornets with virtualized cross-site links. Our testbeds have been demonstrated to local high school students, used to host a high school student from Mexico, a visiting PhD student from China, and many academic and industry visitors. Our research has been well received in the community with over a dozen publications in international conference proceedings and journals. Two PhD students supported by the project won the best PhD scholarship in the department in two consecutive years.

This CRI grant was also instrumental to develop a robotic cyber-physical system test bed at the Department of Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico. The test bed which is part of the MARHES Lab (http://marhes.ece.unm.edu) consists of a fleet of all-terrain ground robots and rotorcraft UAVs (quadrotors) equipped with embedded computers, an environmental sensor suite, and wireless communication capabilities. The support by the CRI program allowed us to attract additional funding from the NSF, DOE and DOD. Several projects use the test bed developed with the partial support of this cyber infrastructure grant. In addition to train students and researchers at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at UNM, this test bed has been used by other departments within UNM and other institutions participating in collaborative projects (Duke University, University of Oklahoma-- REU site). Three PhD students and several MS students developed their dissertations and theses using the CRI test bed. Moreover, this project provided the instrument that enabled us to obtain important research results which have been published in top journals and international conferences. Some of these breakthroughs include: (i) the formulation of communication-aware motion planning for robotic networks (collaboration with Prof. Yasamin Mostofi, NSF IIS); coordination of heterogeneous sensor networks via Adaptive Dynamic Programming and Hybrid Systems (collaboration with Prof. Silvia Ferrari, NSF ECCS); and agile transportation using teams of UAVs. On the educational and outreach side, we taught at UNM two successful courses that cover different aspects of the proposed work such as Autonomous Mobile Robots and Control of Hybrid Systems.

106,"This project aims to contribute to cyber-attack resilient control methods and architectures, which are critically important to safe operation of power grid, medical, manufacturing, traffic and many other control systems.  Malicious attacks on modern time cyber infrastructure have been a daily phenomenon and a constant threat for the nation's security and well-being. There have been numerous cyber-attacks that infiltrated critical industrial control systems, vehicle control units, GPS systems used for navigation and control, air-vehicle autopilots, SCADA systems in the power grid, etc.  In all of these cyber-attacks the aim is to deceive the control and monitoring mechanism and potentially lead the system to instability and malfunction, thus causing physical damages that could be of catastrophic nature.  As control systems are becoming sophisticated and frequently include components from cyberspace, their security is generating greater challenges.  The project focuses on theoretical advancements in resilient control methods as well as experimental safety demonstrations with UAV systems.  It also promotes the engagement of undergraduate students with the topic of safe control system analysis and design.
    
This project aims to address cyber-security for control systems from a control theory perspective, in order to develop controller analysis and synthesis methods applicable for secure software and hardware architectures in order to accurately assess and reduce the risks of such attacks.  In practice controllers are implemented digitally and physical plants evolve in a continuous-time domain. The sampled-data control implementation generates additional vulnerability to stealthy attacks, which, if ignored, can result in a catastrophic event. Security associated with the attacks of interest cannot be dealt with solely by robust controller design nor by standard security software. Instead this project takes the approach of co-designing the control algorithm along with the secure software/hardware platform on which the controller operates, all in a sampled-data framework.

107,"The goal of this project is to demonstrate new cyber-physical architectures that allow the sharing of closed-loop sensor networks among multiple applications through the dynamic allocation of sensing, networking, and computing resources. The sharing of sensor network infrastructures makes the provision of data more cost efficient and leads to virtual private sensor network (VPSN) architectures that can dramatically increase the number of sensor networks available for public use. These cyber infrastructures support a paradigm, called Sensing as a Service, in which users can obtain sensing and computational resources to generate the required data for their sensing applications. The challenge in sharing closed-loop sensor networks is that one application's actuation request might interfere with another's request. To address this challenge the VPSN architectures are comprised of three components: 1) a sensor virtualization layer that ensures that users obtain timely access to sensor data when requested and isolates their requests from others' through the creation of appropriate scheduling algorithms; 2) a computation virtualization layer that enables the allocation of computational resources for real-time data intensive applications which is closely tied to the sensor virtualization layer; 3) a virtualization toolkit that supports application developers in their efforts to build applications for virtualized, closed-loop sensor networks.

The sharing of closed-loop sensor networks leads to substantial savings on infrastructure and maintenance costs. The proposed VPSN architectures enable users to create their own applications without having detailed knowledge of sensing technologies and allows them to focus on the development of applications. VPSNs will contribute to the creation of a nationwide, shared sensing cyber infrastructure, which will provide critical information for public safety and security. VPSNs will also help to revolutionize the way undergraduate and graduate students from many disciplines perform research. Students will be shielded from some of the complexities of sensor networks and allowed to focus on their core research.

108,"The objectives of this project include the design of networked mobile robotic sensor nodes, which are
inspired by insects within the family gerridae, that can monitor water quality in lakes and rivers, and jump
repeatedly to enhance communication capability to overcome the effect of water on radio signal propagation.
This work will also develop energy efficient algorithms that carefully select sensor nodes to jump to gain the
benefit of longer distance communication while managing the energy required to jump. The robotic sensor
can harvest solar energy in a outdoor environment to maintain long term performance. New methods for
sensor localization as the sensor floats within a lake or river will be developed as well as efficient algorithms to collect sensor data and deliver it to the cyber infrastructure that could be used for hydrology modeling and prediction.

systems for water quality monitoring in response to water pollution or other environmental conditions. These
concerns can be from oil spills, issues of bacterial levels, or even detection of levels of radiation from nuclear power plant disasters.

The project considered new methods for sensor localization as the sensor floats, and provide efficient algorithms to collect sensor data and deliver it to the cyber infrastructure.

To build an efficient water surface jumping robot, we focused on our research efforts to unravel fundamental principles for jumping from water surface.  We examined the dynamic process for water jumping so that we can optimize the robot design and established the dynamic model for the interaction between the robot foot and the water surface. The model is complicated since, instead of the reaction force from the rigid ground, the feet experience many forces including surface tension force, hydrostatic force, and hydrodynamic force. The lift force is dominated by the hydrodynamic force which is related to the speed of the feet push water surface.

We considered two approaches for the design of the jumping robot.  The first approach for repetitive jumping from water surface was actuated by DC motor, while the second one is actuated by shape memory alloy. The first approach relies on a carbon fiber strip to store the energy, a DC motor actuated gear train to charge and release energy, and two symmetric flat parts to flap the water. This design aimed to achieve autonomous jumping from water surface. Once this is accomplished, repetitive jumping can be realized by designing a self-righting mechanism to recover from the posture when the robot falls on the water surface. The second approach is based on the principle of buckling for elastic parts. Specifically, a superelastic wire made from shape memory alloy is hosted in a rectangular part, which will float on water surface. By applying a downward force on the wire, it will snap to the other side to push against the water and jump up. The downward force can be generated from a shape memory alloy coiled actuator. Such a mechanism will allow the robot to be extremely lightweight. With a mass of about 6 grams, the robot can jump up to 20 centimeters in height.

We considered several issues regarding collaborative exchange of signals among sensors for improving the localization of the sensors within a sensor field.  In addition to leveraging signal strength detection of a slowly spinning sensor, we considered the introduction of the sets of sensors that are commonly available on a smartphone with the idea that future sensors in the field for these types of applications will integrate such collection of signals  When each sensor shares its own estimated location with neighboring sensors, and each sensor receives radio signals from multiple sources that may relate to distances, corrections of estimated locations computed by dead reckoning can be made. 

We looked into the problems of energy efficient duty cycling with limited throughput and long end-to-end delay in wireless sensor networks. We have introduced a traffic-adaptive synchronous MAC protocol that assigns time slots only to nodes that are located on active routes, addressing the underutilization problem in TDMA from a new perspective. The proposed protocol separates the traffic notification and the data transmission scheduling. Each process is tailored according to its special duties, which greatly improves the efficiency of the proposed protocol. More specifically, the traffic notification packets are only responsible for notifying nodes on active routes of incoming data packets. The size of a traffic notification packet is minimized and a traffic notification packet is transmitted in a ""pulse"" mode to achieve fast traffic notification. In data transmission scheduling phase, a concise representation of channel access schedule is proposed along with a low overhead schedule exchange mechanism. The schedule exchange ensures that time slots are distributed only among nodes that are on active routes and thus the channel utilization is improved in a different way from the slot stealing, providing similar high throughput and low delay with much lower power consumption. 

The results of this research effort have impact for broad areas of science and society.  It proposed a new method for providing a cost-effective approach and a new sensor technology for water quality monitoring that can protect health and enable the better use of public policy when advising people to vacate areas of environmental damage.  The project provided students with a platform to learn and understand all levels of sensor development and operation. Educational impacts have been felt by students in the undergraduate and graduate courses conducted by the PIs of the project.   Graduate students from underrepresented groups have worked on the project. Outreach activities such as robotics summer camps for high school students have been conducted related to this project.

109,"Power systems will undergo a significant change in their behavioral characteristics over the next few years as renewable generation begins to make a meaningful contribution to electricity production. The variability inherent in large-scale renewable generation will challenge traditional power system operating practices. The responsiveness required to incorporate large amounts of renewable generation can, however, be achieved through non-disruptive control of highly distributed loads.  To achieving the desired response from loads that are highly distributed calls for extensive communications, computation and coordination. The overriding objective of the project is therefore to develop practical modeling and analysis techniques that are well suited to the cyber-enabled nature of responsive power systems, and that are rigorously justified. Such a modeling paradigm will become essential as power system responsiveness is enhanced to cater for the variability inherent in large-scale adoption of renewable generation.

Intellectual Merit:

The project will develop a modeling framework that rigorously describes cyber-enabled power systems and provides a platform for investigating the dynamic behavior of real systems. This will involve the development of a functional (delay) differential-algebraic model formulation that incorporates switching and impulsive events. An object-oriented modeling structure will be used, ensuring that arbitrarily large systems can be assembled, verified and analyzed. The extension of trajectory sensitivity concepts to incorporate the modeling of the cyber infrastructure will be of particular importance. These sensitivities will facilitate the extension of uncertainty analysis to functional differential-algebraic models, allowing the development of methods for assessing time-varying uncertainty.


Broader Impacts:

Baheti,7032928339,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Reliable operation of stressed systems requires fast and dependable methods for assessing robustness to instability. In the case of modern power systems, such assessment must take into account uncertainty arising from large-scale renewable generation. Stability analysis of power systems, as for other nonlinear systems, generally relies on repeated simulation. However, evaluating the impact of variations in multiple parameters results in an exponential growth in the number of simulation studies that must be undertaken. In contrast, the project has developed systematic algorithms that enable robustness to instability and tradeoffs between parameters to be evaluated in a straightforward and computationally efficient manner.  This not only allows a vast speed up in quantifying the influences of parameters on stability, but also enables clearer insights into the relative effects of disparate parameters.

The algorithm was motivated by a prior result which showed that the stability boundary is generically composed of the stable manifolds of unstable equilibria which lie on that boundary. That earlier result is applicable when parameters are constant. The project has established conditions under which the stability boundary structure persists as parameter are perturbed.

The first phase of the algorithm varies parameters in a way that drives a trajectory ever closer to a particular unstable equilibrium point. Theory has been developed to show that this process effectively forces the trajectory onto the stability boundary. The resulting set of parameters provides a point on the parameter-space surface that separates stable from unstable cases. Other points on that surface can then be obtained using a continuation process that allows parameters to vary whilst maintaining the trajectory on the stability boundary. The algorithm has been tested on a variety of power systems, including distribution feeders that are susceptible to fault induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR).

110,"Critical Zone (CZ) scientists take as their charge the effort to integrate theory, models and data from the multitude of disciplines studying processes on the Earth's surface - from the atmosphere at the vegetation's canopy to the lower boundary of actively cycling ground waters.  As such, critical zone scientists and their data managers are at the front line of efforts to effectively compile and use the ""dark data in the Long Tail"" of earth science and integrate that data with the ""Big Data"" produced by hydrologists, atmospheric scientists, geospatial modelers and molecular biologists. 
 
The NSF EarthCube initiative recently solicited proposals for domain workshops ""designed to listen to the needs of the end-user groups that make up the geosciences and to understand better how data-enabled science can help them achieve their scientific goals.""  The proponents will convene a workshop to bring together critical zone domain scientists with computer scientists active in EarthCube. 

This workshop would thus serve two objectives: (1) engage approximately 45 cyber-literate critical zone scientists in the EarthCube process; and (2) inform about 20 of EarthCube's cyberscientists of the diversity needs of CZ science.  The overall goal of the workshop would be to develop a set of unifying requirements for the integration of ""long tail"" data and ""big data"" and to develop an interactive community of domain and cyber scientists to pursue solutions.  

There are many examples of how cyber-infrastructure developed for geoscientists have broader impacts to the public.  The national weather service data and model forecasts are highlighted on television and other media outlets.

The NSF EarthCube initiative aims to transform the conduct of research through the development of community-guided cyberinfrastructure to integrate information and data across the geosciences.

This NSF award funded a workshop to engage cyber-literate critical zone scientists in the EarthCube process and to inform EarthCube's cyberscientists of the diversity needs of CZ science. Sixteen CZ disciplines were represented at the workshop with experiences that span the range from Big-Data to Long-Tail science. The national Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) network has begun the process of building a community cyberinfrastructure that the workshop organizing committee feels can serve as a pilot for the EarthCube endeavor of engaging of a diverse community of Earth System scientists to embrace and co-develop a shared data and modeling system. 

The Critical Zone EarthCube Domain Workshop had 103 registered including 28 early-career scientists (6 graduate students, 11 post-docs, 11 assistant level faculty).  Most participants were self-described as representing more than one of the 16 CZ disciplines.  Together in the breakout sessions, they identified that:

The central scientific challenge of the critical zone science community is to develop a ""grand unifying theory"" of the critical zone through a theory-model-data fusion approach to answer:

How do tectonics, lithology, climate and biology co-determine the evolution of critical zone structure and function?;
What are the drivers of energy and material fluxes (i.e. water, sediment, carbon, nutrients, solutes, etc) moving through the critical zone?;
How will critical zone structure, function and evolution respond to human and natural disturbances and over various time and spatial scales?


Workshop participants identified a critical need for CZ and cyber scientists to co-develop a web-based integration and visualization environment for joint analysis of cross-scale bio and geoscience processes in the critical zone (BiG CZ), spanning experimental and observational designs.  This would require a project to:

Engage the CZ and broader community to co-develop and deploy the BiG CZ software stack to meet their specific needs through a CZ community advisory committee and a series of co-design and training &amp; testing workshops
Develop the BiG CZ Portal web application for intuitive, high-performance map-based discovery, visualization, access and publication of data on critical zone structure and function by scientists, resource managers, citizen-science volunteers, and the general public.
Develop the BiG CZ Toolbox to enable cyber-savy CZ scientists to directly access BiG CZ APIs to search, access, manage and publish data using a turnkey open-source scripting and database package.
Develop the BiG CZ Central software stack to bridge data systems developed for multiple critical zone domains into a single metadata catalog for single query search, visualization and access from the Portal web app or using more powerful APIs, and to serve as a public repository for data published via the Toolbox or via web forms.

111,"The focus of this three year REU Site program at Texas A&M University is electrical and computer engineering approaches to research problems involving energy generation, transmission, distribution, storage and management. Cyber-physical interactions within ""smart"" energy systems enable greater intelligence, autonomy and security for safety-critical applications. Specifically, a combination of analytic, computational and experimental projects will be conducted in: active grid management, smart grid cyber security, system stabilization, smart grid sensor systems, coordination of renewable energy sources, superconductors for efficient power distribution, and next generation communications for smart grid connectivity. 

The intellectual merit of the proposed research is to bring the rigorous analytical approach characteristic of electrical and computer engineering to novel problems of importance to emerging cyber-physical energy systems. Recently, there is significant government focus on the development of next generation power systems that provide greater efficiency, power quality and enhanced resiliency and response to attack, natural disaster and system disturbances. The smart grid vision integrates alterative forms of energy and complex cyber infrastructure within legacy technology. This has led to a set of rich and vital research challenges that are addressed in this REU Site. The REU students will participate in developing the next generation of algorithms, protocols and prototype technologies leveraging advances in intelligent signal processing, computation, microelectronics and nano-scale device synthesis. They will participate in developing solutions that will enhance national capabilities in the presence of environmental concerns, security threats, increased energy and autonomy demands, and aging critical infrastructure.

This REU Site will offer research experiences to those who may not normally have such an opportunity, particularly women, underrepresented minorities, and first-generation college students. It makes a significant contribution toward enhancing the diversity of the research and education infrastructure at TAMU and toward increasing the production of advanced-degreed African American and Hispanic engineers. It creates a model program for diverse populations that addresses undergraduates' exposure to research as well as increases awareness of the pathway to graduate school. Having a more diverse engineering and science professoriate significantly benefits society, not only in Texas but nationally, in promoting a more equitable participation of minorities in the engineering and scientific disciplines.

The goal of this award, entitled ""NSF REU SITE: Smart Energy and Smart Systems"" was to annually engage a diverse cadre of undergraduate students from electrical and computer engineering programs across the country in smart energy and smart systems related research. Electrification was recognized by the National Academy of Engineers as the greatest engineering achievement of the twentieth century and ushered in the second industrial revolution &ndash; powered by electricity. Today, electricity is even more important than ever. We challenge our REU participants to imagining daily modern life without it, or even a few hours without ""plugging in"" to recharge a smartphone. Motors still spin to drive manufacturing, but powering the infrastructure to move vast quantities of data is a challenge for the new digital economy as billions of dollars a day are processed in the e-commerce economy. Whether or not our participants pursue a research career in energy, the REU equips them to be energy-aware members of society.

The REU site achieves our goal to provide maximum impact by broadly recruiting candidate from academic institutions across the country to cultural, ethnic and gender diversity. Striving to achieve the highest educational impact, the program targeted students in the sophomore through senior years of their undergraduate education and asked each to identify technical areas of interest. All participants met the NSF US Citizenship requirements. The site provided a high-impact experience by limiting the student-to-mentor ratio to no more than two REU students per faculty mentor with subject-domain expertise in technology areas pertinent to the REU theme of Smart Energy and Smart Systems. In addition to technical mentorships many of the faculty mentors also provided life and career coaching. In total, over the five years of this award the REU site engaged a total of thirty-eight (38) students.

In addition to the in-depth and customized research program tailored to each student, the ECE REU immersed the students in a wide range of complementary activities to build research confidence, graduate school perspective, and a sense of community. The ECE REU coordinated many of its extramural activities with the TAMU College of Engineering Undergraduate Summer Research Grants (USRG) program as well as with the Honors and Undergraduate Research office that provides coordination for REU programs across all disciplines of the entire TAMU campus for the purpose of expanding participant perspective on research and building a community of undergraduate research scholars. Students from multiple REU programs were housed together for a full-immersion experience. The enhancement activities included tours of REU faculty research labs, brown bag luncheons, seminars on graduate studies, monthly luncheons coordinated by the USRG program, and an assortment of informal gatherings and socializing opportunities. Some of the topics included writing a CV, applying to graduate school, choosing a faculty adviser, amongst other topics presented by faculty. In addition, our participants participated in weekly case-studies of engineering ethics and a GRE preparatory class. Communication skills were honed through the preparation of written and oral reports and presentation of a technical poster at culmination of the annual ten-week program.

Cyber-Enabled Discovery and Innovation (CDI)

Proposal Number: 0941143
P/I: Christodoulos Floudas
Institution: Princeton University
Title: CDI-Type II:  MS-Omics Hub for Cyber-enabled Acceleration of Mass Spectrometry-based Metabolomics and Proteomics


Scope of Project and Intellectual Merit:

Mass spectrometry technology has the potential to revolutionize the biological sciences by enabling quantitative and comprehensive assessment of proteins (proteomics) and metabolites (metabolomics). A major challenge, however, is converting raw mass spectrometry data into information useful to biologists. This project represents an effort to transform proteomics and metabolomics by providing an open-source platform for analysis of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and proteomics data which capitalizes on cyberinfrastructure to accelerate biological discovery. Specifically, the project will develop a unified platform for identification and quantitation of metabolites, peptides, and proteins (the MS-Omics Hub) that (1) allows the user to enter mass spectrometry data from diverse instrumentation and returns to the user identities and quantities of assignable metabolite, peptide, and protein peaks, (2) highlights novel, biologically significant species whose importance emerged through cyber-enabled integration of data from diverse users, and (3) provides enhanced computational algorithms for identification of covalently-modified proteins. These algorithms will revolve around an integer linear optimization framework that the PIs have recently shown can substantially improve proteomic data analysis. The utility of the MS-Omics Hub will be demonstrated through its application to a broad spectrum of data, generated both by the grant team and by a diversity of scientists nationwide. 

Intellectual Merit: This effort tackles a barrier preventing proteomics and metabolomics from broadly impacting biological research: the difficulty of extracting compound identities and quantities from raw data. It furthermore addresses the intellectually challenging aspect of proteomic data analysis: computational identification of peaks arising from covalently modified proteins. Finally, it applies cyber-infrastructure to accelerate the identification of peaks arising from novel, biologically-significant metabolites and protein covalent modification sites. The diversity of intellectual challenges involved is mirrored by the multidisciplinary nature of the research team: Floudas, Garcia, and Rabinowitz come from three different departments at Princeton University (Chemical Engineering, Molecular Biology, and Chemistry, respectively), and bring expertise spanning global optimization, scientific computing, mathematical modeling, proteomics, metabolomics, and analytical chemistry. They are unified by their interest in comprehensive, quantitative, computationally-enabled analysis of biochemical systems. 

Broader Impacts:

This research has the potential to transform the biological sciences, by accelerating progress in proteomics and metabolomics and by rendering the power of these emerging fields accessible to a broad spectrum of scientists nationwide. Impact on Society: By enabling a larger research community to conduct state-of-the-art metabolomic and proteomic data analysis, the MS-Omics Hub will expedite global research efforts. By providing an archive of biologically significant peaks, it will accelerate discovery of novel metabolites and protein covalent modification sites. These will likely include novel biomarkers and bioactive compounds. Areas in which improved metabolomic and proteomic capabilities will be applied include medicine, drug discovery, agriculture, bioenergy, and environmental science. Integration of Research and Education: This effort will integrate participation of undergraduate and graduate students in all aspects of the research program, include underrepresented minorities and visiting students from small colleges. The students will receive training in mass spectrometry, computational biology, systems biology, and scientific computation. In addition, as an open-source platform, the MS-Omics Hub will be available as an educational tool to scholars nationwide. The PIs also plan to host an annual ?users? conference to interact with and train the outside MS-Omics Hub users, and to recruit new users to the Hub. Broaden Representation of Underrepresented Groups: Each of the PIs will actively recruit minority students for summer research. Dissemination: In addition to dissemination through standard channels (journals, refereed proceedings, conferences), the MS-Omics Hub will be introduced to the community through a network of mass spectrometry experts, biological beta-testers, and the summer conference. The MS-Omics Hub itself will be open-source (code available on web) and freely accessible to scientists worldwide.",NSF,4900,"TRUSTEES OF PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, THE",Off. of Research & Proj.

This project proposes to develop a pipeline of Information Assurance (IA) professionals by providing scholarships to talented students over a span of four years, with a yearly cohort of 6 to 8 students. The university is well positioned to attract high quality students who are interested in IA. The Computer Science and Computer Engineering curricula prepare students with strong technical competence in the field of Information Assurance. The MS in IA program, jointly offered by the College of Computer and Information Science (CCIS) and the College of Criminal Justice, provides students a holistic view of IA with a curriculum integrating technical, legal and policy issues. Through the IA-related course offerings, research activities, cooperative education opportunities, outreach activities and research activities, the university has established itself as the right place to further develop this expertise. The program has been certified as a Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education and Research (CAE/IAE-R) by NSA/DHS.

 In addition to extensive course development, CCIS and the College of Engineering have joined together to establish an interdisciplinary research institute in Information Assurance. These efforts aim to attract interested students with diverse backgrounds, as well as researchers to participate in advancing the state-of-the-art in Information Assurance. The Cooperative Education Program, the application-oriented projects embedded in the IA curriculum, and faculty connections with IA-focused industries and research laboratories provide the students with an unique advantage in securing permanent and internship employment, particularly with the federal government. 

This program proposes to devote special attention to work with HBCU and HSI colleges/universities, to attract and recruit under-represented students to the field of IA. This project leverages previous experience in working with minority-serving institutions through an NSF REU summer program.",NSF,4900,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,360 HUNTINGTON AVE,BOSTON,US,Boston,MA07,Northeastern University,MA,021155005,47.076,"['David R Kaeli', 'Riccardo  Pucella']",06/25/2009,001423631,1935701,08/31/2014,4900,FED CYBER SERV: SCHLAR FOR SER,1935701,0909990,001423631,Agnes H Chan,360 HUNTINGTON AVE,BOSTON,US,Boston,MA07,Northeastern University,MA,021155005,ahchan@ccs.neu.edu,Agnes,Chan,H,6173732390,vpiotrow@nsf.gov,Victor P.

Security breaches continue to plague our society. The most recent compromise of Home DepotÆs payment systems has caused 56 million credit and debit cards being exposed, resulting in an estimated damage cost of one billion dollars.  FireEye, Inc., an IT security company has shown that 97% of all organizations had been breached, 75% of the organizations had attackers getting control of the breached systems.  Recognizing that ""AmericaÆs economic prosperity, national security, and our individual liberties depend on our commitment to securing cyberspace and maintaining an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable Internet"", President Obama signed the Executive Order 13636, ""Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity"" in February 2013. Researchers have been active in searching for new solutions in securing our network infrastructure and proposing new methodologies for malware/vulnerability detection; at the same time, hackers are coming up with new threats and new attacks.  In order to be ahead of the hackers, the government, the business sectors and educators have to join forces to produce a cadre of qualified professionals to protect the countryÆs critical infrastructure.

 

The goal of this project is to recruit qualified BS and MS students at Northeastern University to be educated in the field of Information Assurance through the Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, and to join the federal workforce to protect the countryÆs cyber infrastructure.  While students from the technical fields, Computer Science (CS), and Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) appear to be the natural candidates for the SFS program, Northeastern University has succeeded in recruiting students from other background such as Criminal Justice, Political Science and Business Management.  Over a period of 4 years with a total of 3 cohorts, this project has supported 22 students in total.  Among them, 5 are CS majors with 3 receiving BS and 2 BS/MS degrees, 8 are ECE majors with 6 receiving BS and 1 each in BS/MS and MS degrees.  The rest of the students, 9 come from the MS in Information Assurance (IA).  With the exception of one undergraduate student who joined the private sector upon graduation, all 21 students have entered the federal, state and national research laboratories.   Among them are NSA, DHS, CIA, Federal Reserve Bank, MITRE Corporation, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and the Executive Office of the President. 

 

As part of the IA education, students are encouraged to participate in extra curricular activities such as Capture the Flag and Collegiate Cyber Defense competitions.  These activities have drawn studentsÆ interest and provided them with hands-on experience. We also provide support to students to attend security related conferences and workshops where they present their research results, meet and learn from other professionals.  These conference presentations also serve as a tool for us to attract and recruit strong students.  In addition, we provide student leadership training by supporting their effort in organizing and running a Cyber Security Networking Day in 2014, where industrial leaders, faculty and NSA researchers were invited to give presentations about their work.   

 

Intellectual Impact  The Scholarship Program has attracted strong students to enter the IA workforce, and has stimulated interest among other students.  We have observed a surge of interest among undergraduate students who are interested in pursuing a Computer Science major specializing in cyber security.  Our on-going faculty research activities on Virtual Machines, Malware and Cloud Security contribute to a better understanding of the vulnerabilities of commonly adopted technologies.  We propose methodologies to improve usersÆ security and privacy while using the publicly available application software.

This project will also develop and deploy the novel cyber-infrastructure and software tools needed to advance the state-of-the-art in bio-inspired robotic systems and biologically-inspired robotics education.  A repository of educational materials, designs and models will be made available over the Internet and provided for use by educators and researchers around the country.
In this way, this project aims to create mechanisms for education and training of multi-disciplinary engineers who are versed in the cyber-infrastructure tools and understand how they can use them to transform and harness collective human problem solving capabilities. 

The project contributes to the transformation of engineering into an ``informatics'' discipline and tightens the interaction computer science and engineering.  Ultimately, engineering informatics will become an instrumental part of undergraduate and graduate curricula in engineering and computer science.  In addition, the bio-inspired robotics domain will prove to be a source of exciting and attractive materials and demonstrations.  These materials and demonstrations will be used in outreach and secondary education activities to expose students to engineering and computer science concepts and increase the participation of under-represented groups in these professions.  The team plans to leverage numerous ongoing outreach and training activities at the respective institutions to maximize the impact of the project.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL,104 AIRPORT DR STE 2200,CHAPEL HILL,US,Chapel Hill,NC04,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,NC,275991350,47.070,['Dinesh  Manocha'],09/28/2006,608195277,225000,12/31/2009,4900,CI-TEAM,225000,0636208,142363428,Ming C Lin,104 AIRPORT DR STE 2200,CHAPEL HILL,US,Chapel Hill,NC04,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,NC,275991350,lin@cs.umd.edu,Ming,Lin,C,3014052662,@nsf.gov,,,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,"['W.

119,"The objective of this research is to address the challenge in trustworthy sensing and communications, as content-rich audio-visual streams become increasingly adapted on-the-fly for individual receivers. The proposed project develops a novel framework of Forensic Hash for Information Assurance (FASHION) in sensing and communications. The framework utilizes a strategically designed compact string and the associated decision mechanism to transcend the capabilities of conventional hash and non-intrusive forensics. Offering more forensic answers about data integrity, origin, and processing history in higher accuracy and efficiency, the proposed framework overcomes the current one-size-fit-all dilemma to enable trust assessment to a high level. The main investigations include: what evidentiary information to form forensic hash; theories and algorithms on how to compactly and securely encode forensic hash, and robustly and securely associate it with source data; attack strategies and counter-attacks; and developing a Testbed for experimental evaluation of the proposed framework.

The intellectual merit lies in exploring the unchartered area of Information Forensic Hash that transcends from prior art, advancing theories and algorithms of assured cyber sensing and communications, and providing new capabilities and tools to the community. In particular, the proposal leverages recent advances in non-intrusive forensics to add flexibility and reveal richer information for trustworthiness assessment of cyber-based sensing and communications. The proposed research has the potential to open a new research area in information forensics which is very relevant to the health and development of the cyber-infrastructure.

The proposed research, if successful, could have significant impact on many applications of national interests, including the US IT infrastructure, as sensing and communicating audio-visual data have become a central part in government operations and in services by the high-tech industry, whose continuing success is critical to U.S.'s economic prosperity.

This path of technological evolution has naturally led to a critical issue that must be addressed next, namely, to ensure that content, devices, and intellectual property are being used by authorized users for legitimate purposes, and to be able to forensically prove with high confidence when otherwise. When security is compromised or authenticity is forged, forensic methodologies and tools are employed to reconstruct what has happened to digital content in order to answer who has done what, when, where, and how.

In order to verify the integrity of a digital document, security practice often creates a piece of digital reference known as a hash.  A hash is generated based on the document content using cryptographically sound operations so that only an authorized user (such as document owner or sender) can develop a valid hash, attach with the document, and later the hash can be used by others as a reference. When the document content is tampered, the result from a verifying operation would show inconsistency with the attached hash, thus revealing the content tampering.  Authenticating multimedia content, however, is more sophisticated than text data, because not only can multimedia content can be stored in substantially different format, they are also transcoded in various ways, for example, to reduce the bitrate when transmission bandwidth is limited, to a different size when the end-user has a display device of different size and shape than the senders. An example of size change combined with content tampering is shown in the attached Figure 1.

This NSF supported project tackles the verification of digital data through a novel framework of forensic hash, which is a small-size reference of about a few hundred of bytes that can help reveal more information about the processing history of the data under question and facilitate answering questions about what has been done on the data.  Forensic hash constructions developed through our research provides robust geometric transform estimation, accurate tampering localization, excellent discrimination capability and a novel capability to estimate seam carving &ndash; the state-of-the-art resizing tools for images and video. With such capabilities in answering a broad scope of forensic questions in an accurate and efficient way, our proposed forensic hash can be a valuable tool to help evaluate the trustworthiness of electronic media and signals.

We have further leverage the new forensic hash framework and extend it to address an important problem beyond security. Increasingly, images transmitted and rendered at receiversÆ end may have a different size and aspect ratio from those of the original, in order to meet the heterogeneous situations and needs of transmission bandwidth and display capabilities.  This calls for automatically monitoring and evaluation of image quality for Quality-of-Service (QoS) assurance in broadband communications and online/mobile media applications.  We use ""retargeted images"" having undergone content-adaptive resizing as an example and made novel use of the forensic hash framework from this research project to tackle the new challenge of quality assessment for retargeted images. For the U.S. wireless and communication industry to address the marketÆs needs and global competition, the research outcome from this project contributes to technology innovations. Furthermore, the mentoring and engagement of the undergraduate and graduate students who participated in this research (including female and under-represented minorities) have contributed to the work force development in STEM areas that is critical for sustained technological advancement and prosperity.

Proposal Number:	EPS-1006988
Institution:	University of Nebraska
Project Director:	F. Fred Choobineh 

This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). 

Nebraska plans to invest in the foundation for a statewide cyber backbone for high speed data and video transfer that will be created by expansion of the Nebraska University Regional Optical Network (NURON), a fiber ring between Lincoln and Omaha with connectivity to Internet 2 through Kansas City. The project?s lead institutions are: the University of Nebraska (NU) Central Administration, University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), and University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO). Institutions located in 29 Nebraska communities will participate in the project.

Expansion of NURON is planned to be completed in three phases; however, the goal of this project is to invest in the first phase of the three phases required to build the network. In phase 1, 21 institutions (29 sites) of higher learning across the state, ranging from community colleges to research universities, would be connected. NURON will have seven primary sites (hubs), connected by fiber loops, that would serve as access points for secondary sites. Secondary sites would be connected to the hubs in star configuration. These hubs would be used to connect to Network Nebraska-Education which already has begun providing regionally unified technology for distance delivery of educational content including formal K-12 courses and to the Nebraska State Telehealth Network which currently links 83 state healthcare providers.

Intellectual Merit
Expansion and enhancement of NURON is expected to provide Nebraska with cyber-infrastructure (CI) resources to connect the state?s Education and Telehealth Networks to higher education?thus providing new education, healthcare, and research opportunities to citizens of the state?and to connect these networks to national cyber networks providing access to supercomputing computing and other resources around the state, country and the world. This project would facilitate a) collaborative intra- and inter-state research in multiple disciplines by forming research clusters with the required critical mass and b) the creation of distributed sensor networks tied to NURON hubs for collection of real time environmental and climate data to conduct environmental and climate research.
Examples of research and education efforts enabled by this NE RII C2 project include: 
(a)	The Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at CERN in Switzerland - Five UNL Physics faculty members are participating in this large scale international project at the Large Hadron Collider at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). 
(b)	Geosciences and climate modeling - UNL researchers are trying to use the Great Plains as a testbed for studying regional climate impacts. They will simulate land surface fluxes of water, carbon, and energy impact atmospheric processes at scales ranging from local weather to global greenhouse effects.
(c)	Bioinformatics - Nebraska researchers generate an enormous amount of molecular genomic and proteomic data. The investments of the RII C2 proposal would further enhance the analysis capability of Nebraska?s current (RII 2007-2010) researchers beyond the current grant, and further assist algal researchers who are a part of the RII proposal (RII 2010-2015).
(d)	Computational Nanoscience - Five UNL and two UNO faculty members collaboratively have been working in the area of computational nanomaterials. Examples of their notable discoveries include the discovery of a new form of water, prediction and understanding of electron tunneling through ultra-thin ferroelectrics, discovery of the first metallic nanocluster - hollow gold nanocages, and many others. This area is the focus of the Nebraska - Puerto Rico RII Track-2 proposal.

Broader Impacts
The creation of a state cyber backbone will remove distance as a barrier to sharing and collaboration and would a) facilitate expansion and accessibility of online courses and provide an impetus for establishing formal policies among state colleges and universities for acceptance of online credits hours by non-originating institutions; b) provide a statewide reliable network with higher speed and bandwidth to deliver K-12 course content to disadvantaged students and, in turn, level the playing field for the rural students with respect to their metropolitan counterparts; c) permit sharing of medical expertise across Nebraska; d) permit creation of a reliable monitoring network for security enhancement; and e) connect University of Nebraska research and extension sites dispersed throughout the state.",NSF,4900,BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA,3835 Holdrege Street,Lincoln,US,Lincoln,NE01,University of Nebraska,NE,685031435,47.081,"['Hesham H Ali', 'David R Swanson', 'Walter  Weir']",08/18/2010,068662618,1176470,11/30/2012,4900,RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROV,1176470,1006988,068662618,F.

Eight colleges and universities in Nebraska received vital upgrades to their connections to the Nebraska University Regional Optical Network (NEURON), thanks to a $1.17 million Track C2 grant to Nebraska EPSCoR.  NEURON is the cyber optic backbone ring that facilitates high speed data transfer and connects Nebraska institutions to the worldwide Internet 2.

The Creighton University connection to the network was upgraded to 10 gigabits, enabling collaborations with research universities in the state and enhancing CreightonÆs distance education. Advanced computational collaborations were further enhanced by an upgrade of the NEURON connection between University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the Peter Kiewit Institute in Omaha, and the University of Nebraska Medical Center from 10 gigabits to 30 gigabits.

Wayne State College, in northeast Nebraska, was connected to NEURON through a 1 gigabit line, and an additional 300 megabit line was connected to a second campus, College Center.  The College Center campus in South Sioux City is a collaborative higher education location combining the teaching/coursework from Wayne State College and Northeast Community College (Norfolk, Nebraska).

For Wayne State College, the increased bandwidth has had a cascade of benefits, improving access to the student information and human resources systems, and making possible the installation of a small super computer cluster. The cluster will allow students to gain experience in parallel computing and management, and could lead to participation in the Open Science Grid. 

Through this grant, NebraskaÆs tribal colleges received significant cyberinfrastructure upgrades. New 100 megabit high speed connections to NEURON became possible with the installation of new fiber cable for Little Priest Tribal College in Winnebago and Nebraska Indian Community CollegeÆs campuses at Macy and South Sioux City.

The tribal colleges moved quickly to capitalize on the opportunities afforded by greater internet bandwidth. Little Priest Tribal College (LPTC) expanded distance course offerings to its students and now offers joint classes with instructors at the University of Nebraska at Omaha and University of Nebraska Medical Center. With the increased bandwidth, LPTC established a radio station that streams its content to a nearby tower for broadcast. The increased bandwidth significantly improved the experience of Nebraska Indian Community College students who participate in their Video TeleConference systems, and allowed the college to teach 90% of its courses online.

The final component of the grant is the extension of multiple 10 gigabit lines from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to Grand Island, where several higher education centers connect. This lays the groundwork for connecting the University of Nebraska at Kearney to the NEURON ring, and will support NEURON access for a number of central Nebraska colleges, such as Doane and Central Community College.

The critical cyberinfrastructure installed from this grant enabled partner institutions to undertake upgrades of their own, including upgrades at Chadron State College and of over 200 K-20 sites across the state.

Through strategic network upgrades, Track C2 aimed to 1) broaden opportunities for advanced research and collaborations among academic institutions, and 2) facilitate access to distance education and specialized health care for rural Nebraska residents. Future investments will extend NEURON connections to western Nebraska.

121,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).

Engineering versatile drug delivery vehicles that enable simultaneous delivery of several agents is a key challenge in medicine. Liposomes would gain significant stability and functional capacity from having a solid core, tethered to the bilayer by strong linkers. Nevertheless, designing and constructing such complex nanoparticles remains an open question. To achieve this goal, we present a multidisciplinary multi-site strategy that transforms conventional laboratory-centered synthesis into cyber-based nano-design. Its three key components are: (1) a multiscale modeling hierarchy bridging the divide between molecules and physical meso-structure; (2) novel design- and parameter-optimization algorithms that exploit autonomous data exchange and learning over a distributed grid; and (3) a feedback system, in which simulations guide syntheses of improved nanoconstructs, while in vitro characterizations validate and improve their corresponding in silico representations. 
We are establishing a virtual organization that links four institutions (UC Davis, Colorado School of Mines, Carnegie Mellon, and Virginia Tech) to maximally exploit our joint expertise across a broad spectrum of disciplines. This cyber-infrastructure enables our transformative approach to the rational computer-aided design of functional nanoconstructs. All partners will regularly exchange group members to both share knowledge and acquire training outside their disciplines. We will hold frequent virtual meetings and annual team conferences with a final conference including outside partners.

This research will develop novel nanoparticles as more efficient drug delivery carriers. At the same time, the cyber framework being developing will serve as a model for developing a real-time, virtual network that links computational and experimental science. For instance, this research shows how software can facilitate new computing infrastructures and how the synergy of a fresh, diverse team can be harnessed to span the divide between computational and experimental research in engineering and science. A web-based data repository will serve as a communication hub among the partners to allow instant access to all tools and findings. After validation, these methods will be made available to the scientific community at large by using the same hub.

The addition of an ADA-compliant parking space and restrooms will provide accessibility to all visitors. The field station remodel complements the recent construction of 8 tent cabins for overnight stays, increasing the overnight capacity of the reserve from 4 to 32.  The server room will provide a climate-controlled home for multiple servers dedicated to the extensive cyber-infrastructure of the reserve. Increased server and computing capacity will support research activities resulting from a recently deployed automated animal tracking system and wireless mesh network. This network provides the ability for participants to access and view cameras, acoustical records, and animal movement from any location.

The research program at Quail Ridge continues to grow, and now includes several NSF-funded
projects in addition to many graduate student projects. A fundamental advantage of working at a well-designed field station is the potential for cross-disciplinary interactions, often resulting in novel collaborations, and, particularly in the case of the Quail Ridge Reserve, for truly cross-cultural interactions between students from very different socioeconomic, ethnic, and educational backgrounds. Half of the faculty currently involved in teaching and research at the reserve are women, several minority-serving institutions use the reserve heavily, and many of the students participating in research projects are first
generation college attendees. Quail Ridge Reserve is currently in the process of coordinating with the John Muir Institute of the Environment and the Dept. of Education at UC Davis in developing a citizen-science outreach project to access, catalogue, and archive data collected by these remote sensors.

Instead of an ill-suited, converted hunting cabin, users now have a clean and inviting facility in which to work and interact. The field station is the nexus of activity at the reserve &ndash; all researchers, classes, and visitors come here first. The building provides support infrastructure for simple overnight lodgings with an improved, clean and efficient kitchen, accessible bathrooms, and an indoor dining option. It provides a secure and climate-conditioned space for the reserve?s cyber-infrastructure. The new facility takes advantage of the hilltop location to highlight the spectacular views, and serves as an attractive reserve resource, and off-campus destination.

The improved facility provides a centralized space for the reserve's eight tent cabins used by research and class groups. A limited building footprint required optimizing flexible uses of the facility. The main meeting room can be expanded by opening accordion doors that extend the living space to the northern and southern patios, with the added advantage of connecting users to the outdoors and the environment around them. The building provides a large efficient kitchen that can concurrently support overnight groups and visiting day users. Likewise, bathrooms are accessible inside and out to provide discrete use areas. The sustainable design combines passive solar and upgraded insulation with energy efficient HVAC, lighting, and appliances.

The new station provides an attractive central gathering place that fosters interaction between students and faculty, and among research groups. This allows for cross-disciplinary interactions, which may result in novel collaborations, and, particularly in the case of the Quail Ridge Reserve, truly cross-cultural interactions between students from very different socioeconomic, ethnic, and educational backgrounds. Half of the faculty currently involved in teaching and research at the reserve are women, several minority-serving institutions use the reserve heavily, and many of the students participating in research projects are first generation college attendees. 

A core of research activities at the reserve centers on its cyber-infrastructure. Previously, this vital equipment was relegated to a makeshift attic in the original metal building, which was poorly sealed and insulated and a maximum height of three feet. A new climate-conditioned room with server racks and a backup power supply has allowed us to upgrade some of the hardware to sustain both the Quail Ridge Wireless Mesh Network testbed (QuRiNet) and the Quail Ridge Automated Animal Tracking System (QRAAT). These systems are the reserve?s most effective outreach tool, allowing participants the ability to remotely access cameras, acoustic recordings, and animal movement data.

126,"Compilers are software tools that bridge the gap between the functions supported by hardware processor and high level programming languages.  Cetus is a compiler infrastructure at Purdue University, is publicly available (downloaded over 1000 times for use in compiler research), and has become an important part of the global compiler research infrastructure.  The Cetus compiler infrastructures supports the goals of the NSF CRI program by providing an easy to extend code base that allows the broader compiler research community to avoid having to repeatedly re-implement foundational compiler techniques and thereby accelerating the discovery of knowledge in the area of compilers and programming tools.  

The work funded by this proposal has several goals. First, the group will continue to maintain this essential infrastructure for the community and to add enhancements that satisfy user requirements.   Second, the group will continue to keep Cetus' internal representations at a high level of abstraction allowing it to be used as a building block for instructional purposes.  Third, while Cetus is the most advanced program parallelizer, its capabilities will be further enhanced, particularly for GPU accelerators, for analyzing and optimizing irregular programs, and for auto-tuning programs for best results.

130,"This project uses broadband communication to support a diverse community of STEM learners,  including K-12 students, their teachers and parents, school administrators, community organizers, city planners, and university faculty and graduate students. The project will build a community-situated, challenge-based, collaborative cyber-learning environment (C3STEM) that harnesses computational thinking, modeling, simulation, and challenge-based learning to support STEM learning in the context of a city traffic planning. C3STEM will use the traffic domain as the source for real-world problems for STEM education by developing projects through which high school students (from at least two schools) will collaboratively address problems of traffic congestion and safety in urban and suburban environments.   Classroom-based student groups will work with their classroom teacher, traffic experts, and the Vanderbilt researchers to analyze real traffic data from regions near their homes and schools. The collaborative effort will lead to the students gaining an understanding of the traffic patterns, which will support the students developing agent-based models that align with the observed patterns in their section (e.g., traffic congestion along selected thoroughfares at different times of day and the effects of stoplights and interstate on/off-ramps).  This process will teach fundamental concepts of data analysis and computer-based modeling and will motivate other curriculum-related mathematics and science lessons such as, Physics concepts, such as inertia, speed and acceleration, and Mathematical concepts, such as algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics.    The project will leverage GENI and broadband infrastructure to provide real-time collaborative sessions and large-scale data transfers.

Broader Impact:
Via the combination of broadband communication, live data from community resources, computational modeling and collaborative learning, the products of student labor will not simply be for a grade, but their work will be regarded as an contribution to the community. This represents a cultural shift, which not only puts STEM in the foreground of active citizenship, but also raises the stature of teachers and K-12 education. The project results will be not only disseminated through journals and conferences but student projects will be displayed on a Web-based 'science-fair' and the PIs will create a Wikibook that archives the lesson plans and their evaluation.

Our research group has developed an innovative community-situated, challenge-based, collaborative learning environment (C3STEM) that harnesses computational thinking, modeling, and simulation situated in the framework of real-world problem solving to support ubiquitous STEM learning in high school classrooms. Studies with high school students have shown strong synergistic learning of STEM and Computer Science concepts. Furthermore, the findings provided us valuable insights into R&amp;D needs at the infrastructure level for scalable and resilient collaborative learning in formal and informal environments.

The key outcomes of this project can be summarized along the following dimensions:

(1)    C3STEM Infrastructure: C3STEM incorporates two core learning environments based on modeling and simulation: (1) CTSiM (Computational Thinking using Simulation and Modeling) for fundamental physics- and calculus-based modeling of vehicle and traffic operation, while also incorporating parameters that imply driver behaviors, and (2) C2SuMo (Cloud-based, Collaborative, Scaled-up Modeling) for macro-level modeling that uses a Google Maps interface along with the high-fidelity Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO), a freely-available open-source visual traffic simulator for scaled-up, city-wide traffic simulations. Students start with CTSiM, a visual modeling and simulation environment that emphasizes computational thinking to build models of vehicle dynamics using their fundamental knowledge of NewtonÆs laws of mechanics, and then extend these models to include driver behaviors to model traffic flow on city streets. CTSiM adopts an agent-based modeling paradigm that provides the basis for designing a progression of C3STEM traffic simulation units that build on one another. After working individually on a set of CTSiM and C2SuMo units, students work in small groups to collaboratively solve a challenge problem that requires them to find the right timing sequences for a set of adjacent traffic lights to maximize traffic flow (minimize waiting times) through the intersections.

(2)    Curricular Units: For the CTSiM curricular units we developed six problem units that focus on model buluilding using fundamental knowledge of physics and calculus. The problem units include: (1) vehicles decelerating to stop at a STOP sign, and then accelerating to speed up; (2) vehicle taking left and right turns at an intersection; and (3) traffic flow through an intersection, which include left and right turns first with a STOP sign, and then with traffic lights. In addition, they have to account for driver behavior, which is expressed using parameters, such as the minimum stopping distance and gap acceptance. Students also use C2SuMo to build similar units for scaled up simulations with aggregated parameters. One of the challenges they have to work on is the relation between first principle and aggregated parameters so they can explain the traffic flow behaviors they observe when conducting experiments. The last two units students work on are challenge problems, where students work in small groups to sequence traffic lights to optimize traffic flow through adjacent intersections in a city grid.

(3)    User Studies and Findings: Our final set of  studies included one with 62 students from two Chattanooga high schools: (a) The STEM High School, and (b) East Hamilton High School. Students worked remotely to access the cloud-based server at Vanderbilt University to work on the CTSiM and C2SuMo units. A second study involved 26 high school students from Nashville Metro schools, who worked on the system and challenge problems in the classroom as well as from home.

132,"Goals: This Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) award seeks to build upon prior RII-supported efforts to expand the core facilities of the University?s Center of Excellence in Marine and Environmental Studies. At this center, scientists investigate the connections between ocean and coastal waters; the biological and geophysical linkages of the land-sea interface; and their potential impact on coral reef ecosystems. Specifically, this project will investigate the factors that enhance or reduce coral reefs? tolerance to environmental stress to better understand ecological resilience. The people of the Virgin Islands rely heavily on   Caribbean coastal resources for subsistence, and are alarmed by findings that indicate that nearly 70% of the coral reefs are threatened by costal development, pollution, sedimentation, and over-fishing.  Rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification and ineffective management add further threats to Caribbean coral reefs.

Project Major Foci: Because of the US Virgin Islands? reliance on the surrounding coastal waters and coral reef ecosystems for tourism (economic engine), transportation, food and recreation, the research focus is Biocomplexity in Caribbean Coral Reefs. Three research projects have been developed into the Integrated Caribbean Coastal Ecosystem Research Plan: 1) Evolutionary and Ecological Patterns and Processes team will investigate the numerous processes that threaten coral reef ecosystems; 2) Ocean and Coastal Processes team will provide the physical foundation for interpreting biological processes based upon field data and ocean modeling; and 3) Environmental Analysis and Management team will address the gap between physical and human interactions in coastal ecosystems and the underlying importance of socio-economics on successful natural resource management.

Intellectual Merit
The project will investigate factors that enhance or reduce a coral reef?s tolerance to environmental stress and the coral reef?s resistance to transitions to alternate ecological states. Anticipated project outcomes include a better understanding of how ecological patterns and processes are influenced by natural and anthropogenic disturbances. 

Broader Impacts
The research outcomes will inform decision-makers on natural resource management and spatial planning and will enhance human and ocean health. There is an urgent need for this information given the trends on coral reef mortality in the region and the potential negative impact to the region?s economy.  Research results may be applicable to regions outside the Caribbean.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS,#2 John Brewers Bay,Charlotte Amalie,US,St Thomas,VI00,University of The Virgin Islands,VI,008026004,47.083,"['Richard  Nemeth', 'Nicolas  Drayton']",09/17/2008,090003765,11500000,11/30/2014,4900,EPSCoR Research Infrastructure,12450867,0814417,090003765,Henry H Smith,#2 John Brewers Bay,Charlotte Amalie,US,St Thomas,VI00,University of The Virgin Islands,VI,008026004,hsmith@uvi.edu,Henry,Smith,H,3406931062,skennan@nsf.gov,"Kennan, Sean C.",7032927575,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The goal of the Research Infrastructure Improvement Project undertaken by the Virgin Islands Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research was to build nationally-competitive research capacity at the University of the Virgin Islands.  This was done by improving the research infrastructure and building multi-disciplinary teams of research scientists.

 

The research was carried out through a program that integrated physical, biological and social science disciplines in order to understand the natural and social patterns and processes that exist in the coastal environment in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The second major component of the project focused on building partnerships between the researchers and the broader community in order to address marine and environmental issues and enable actions that result in sustainable development opportunities for the Territory.

 

The project produced significant results in all its components, by: providing infrastructure to support research and enhanced student learning outcomes at the University of the Virgin Islands; producing new information on the coastal ecosystems in the U.S. Virgin Islands; increasing the pool of Virgin Islanders with advanced degrees in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields; adding to the science education of Virgin Islands students; enhancing the skills of professionals in the community; and providing technical support to local development initiatives.

 

The research infrastructure provided by the project includes upgrades to the MacLean Marine Science  Center, renovations to the Virgin Islands Environmental Resource Station, and renovations to establish a new oceanographic laboratory, a new environmental analysis laboratory, and facilities that form the Institute for Geo-Computational Analysis and Statistics.  The infrastructure greatly increased the capacity of the University of the Virgin  Islands to conduct multi-disciplinary research as required by the project.

 

The research increased local knowledge of how coral reef ecosystems function, including the connections between the physical factors and biological patterns, how coral diseases are transmitted, how corals at different depths respond to different types and levels of stress, and how ecological patterns and processes are influenced by disturbance from natural and human sources.  The project also increased understanding of the relationship between biological systems and human health.

 

The intellectual merit of the research program was highlighted by the large number of publications in scientific journals of high caliber, the increasing impact factor of those publications (indicating a greater contribution and impact on the scientific community), and the large number of external (including international) scientists that collaborated with Virgin Islands EPSCoR scientists in research activities and co-authoring scientific papers for publication.

 

The project produced impacts beyond the intellectual merit of the research program.  One such impact is the increase in the research competitiveness of the University of the Virgin Islands, as evidenced by the increase in grant awards and the number of visiting scientists that utilize the research facilities.  The enhanced capacity from improved cyber-infrastructure and the availability of various databases support collaboration with external scientists in projects where significant computing capacity is required.

 

The project was also beneficial to the wider Virgin Islands community in several ways.  The project partnered with local institutions and groups to support training for large numbers of high school students in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  Graduates from the Master of Marine and Environmental Science degree program and the Master of Arts in Mathematics for Secondary Teachers degree program provide enhanced knowledge and skills to the University of the Virgin Islands, agencies...",,"['Renchen, G.

133,"Indiana University is awarded a grant to develop integrated, shared database tools, such as those built under the umbrella of the collaborative Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) project. Software tools to fully assembly, analyze and compare these genomes are available, but the ability to employ them is limited to those with extensive computational resources and engineering talent. In this project, methods are being developed for use by existing and emerging model organism databases that will address genome database access needs and middleware for comparative analyses. Effective use of shared cyberinfrastructure, such as NSF-sponsored TeraGrid and other Grid systems, is addressed with data grid methods that partition large genome database sets for effective use of Grid systems. BIOSCI/Bionet, a network of biology news and discussion, is approaching its third decade of service to the life sciences community. This project will maintain and improve Bionet news for several model organism communities, and areas of molecular methods, bio-software, microbiology, proteins, plant biology and others. The Bio-mirror project for distribution of large genomic and biology databanks is administered under this project, and provides infrastructure for effective genome database analyses. This project improves overall access to life sciences knowledge for all citizens. It aids the education of a broad spectrum of scientists, students and the general public, consistent with national and industry goals of teaching and research in biology and informatics. The project is a component of the infrastructure of bioinformatics in the US and worldwide, and improves partnerships with Asian-Pacific, African, European and western hemisphere nations. BIOSCI/Bionet news, IUBio Archive and Bio-Mirror projects will continue a multi-decade record of serving the world community with public access to biology information.",NSF,4900,TRUSTEES OF INDIANA UNIVERSITY,509 E 3RD ST,Bloomington,US,Bloomington,IN09,Indiana University,IN,474013654,47.074,,04/04/2007,006046700,1089019,03/31/2013,4900,ADVANCES IN BIO INFORMATICS,873414,0640462,006046700,Donald G Gilbert,509 E 3RD ST,Bloomington,US,Bloomington,IN09,Indiana University,IN,474013654,gilbertd@indiana.edu,Donald,Gilbert,G,8123335616,pmccartn@nsf.gov,Peter H.

This project provides new developments in genome database informatics and cyber-infrastructure to several bioscience communities for discovering genomes and gene-environment interactions (http://eugenes.org/EvidentialGene/). It also supports public biology news, data sharing and information services (http://www.bio.net and http://bio-mirror.net). 

 New methods that determine high quality gene information have been developed and published for others to use.  Resulting gene structures and descriptions of several animals and plants are placed into public databases that will continue for many years as a basis of new discoveries by scientists, biomedical and agricultural researchers.  A basic engineering discovery of this work overturns dogma that genes must be determined from genome assemblies; instead genes can be better determined from expressed gene sequences.  Impacts of this work today and in future include: discovering genetic responses to environmental health impacts of man-made or natural toxins to the aquatic sentinel water flea; improvements to sustainable agricultural through understanding plant disease resistances and other traits that aid farmers around the world; better understanding of genetic interactions of human disease vectors and agriculturally beneficial and pest bugs such as aphids, ticks, bees and wasps.

134,"Northeastern University, one of the sixteen National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cyber Operations, proposes to continue and expand its participation in the CyberCorps(R) Scholarship for Service (SFS) program to prepare highly-qualified cybersecurity professionals for entry into the government workforce. The students supported by this grant will develop the necessary skillset to serve the nation in securing its cyber infrastructure. The project will have an immediate impact on the information assurance and forensics capabilities of the federal workforce by developing well-trained cybersecurity professionals. The University has received all three designations available for Centers of Academic Excellence, in Information Assurance Education, Research and Cyber Operations. Together with its nationally-recognized Cooperative Education, Northeastern University is well-positioned to attract and educate strong students in multi-disciplinary programs in Information Assurance. The University has established a well-designed infrastructure to manage and to support the SFS program on campus and continues to recruit a diverse group of under-represented students to this program. The University also works with a variety of local community colleges to plan pathways for adult learners to go into the field of cybersecurity. Northeastern will continue to build a community among SFS students through activities, such as Capture-the-Flag, Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition, Hackathon and the Speaker Series.

Northeastern University is committed to advancing the nation's cybersecurity capability by recruiting and educating strong students for the next generation of cybersecurity professionals, and engaging faculty and students in the forefront of research in related areas. The University's education and research programs in cybersecurity are fundamentally multi-disciplinary. They provide students with theoretical foundations in the principles of information assurance, but they also focus on developing ethical behavior, practical skill sets through team-based projects, hands-on activities, and security-related cooperative education assignments. Many of these students come from various backgrounds, ranging from Political Science and Criminal Justice to Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Physics. Since cybersecurity involves both the technical and behavioral sciences, the fact that each student brings a different perspective to the discipline contributes to a better understanding of the issues and their solutions. The George J. Kostas Research Institute for Homeland Security, established through alumni donation, fosters collaborative, use-inspired, research aimed at expanding the capacity of communities, critical systems, and infrastructure to withstand, respond to, and recover from man-made and natural catastrophes.

This infrastructure project aimed to provide the necessary computing resources to support such investigations.


The infrastructure supported a wide range of research projects, leading to the publication of 13 papers and theses.  These included:


- Ingestion of ""threat intelligence"" feeds (security-related data streams of varying types and of varying curation and richness, shared among a set of parties to facilitate stronger security practices) from more than 300 sources, spanning 10.1 billion ""indicators"" (IP addresses, urls, domains, credentials, email addresses, etc.) and 315 million malware hashes from 14 million families.


- Generating a novel dataset of web browser feature usage under interactive workloads, spanning nearly all of the sites in the top 10,000 Alexa list, and including data about over 21 billion JavaScript feature invocations across visits to over 2.2 million web pages.


- Analysis more than 3 years of SMTP and network traffic logs (372 million email log entries, 93 million correlations between those and HTTP traffic), from a large enterprise to detect spear phishing attacks.  This work was awarded Facebook's $100,000 Internet Defense Prize.


- Developed IP address ""Target Generation Algorithms"" in support of efficient Internet-scale measurements of the IPv6 address space.


- Performed extensive analyses relating to performing third-party measurement of network-layer Internet censorship by leveraging IP header side-channels to infer whether a remote client in an arbitrary country A experiences blockage if attempting to contact a remote server in an arbitrary country B.


- Performed extensive analyses relating to performing third-party measurement of DNS-based Internet censorship, measuring whether remote clients in an arbitrary country A receive incorrect responses when attempting to look up domains associated with a remote server in an arbitrary country B.


- Analyzed a number of data sources to assess the nature and dynamics of blocking of access by the Tor anonymity system to various remote services.  Such blocking erodes the utility of Tor, making it more difficult to grow the system to scales that enable it to robustly facilitate censorship evasion.

- Collected and analyzed the effects of ""doxing"", the unauthorized investigation and discovery of a victim's identifying information like home address, work information, and OSN handles.

- Undertook an analysis of the evolution of dynamic behavior (system call) evolution in several hundreds of thousands of malware samples, attempting to identify whether and how malware authors modify their samples' dynamic behavior to evade detection.

137,"Intellectual Merit:
This award funds a workshop that focuses on the impact of rapidly evolving information and communications technology, i.e., cyber-infrastructures, on the activities of discovery, innovation, and learning. Cyber-infrastructure in discovery and learning is of significant current interest. Paradigm shifts that have impacted many industries appear poised to transform higher education and the academic research environment.

The goals of the workshop are to set an agenda for how to transform the what, the how, and who participates in discovery and learning; to personalize and broaden participation in discovery and learning; and to accelerate discovery and the transfer from discovery to innovative use. The specific workshop objectives are to: 1) explore and articulate key research questions, likely game-changers, and possible paradigm shifts, 2) frame an interdisciplinary research agenda for the next decade, and 3) identify possible research programs, experiments, and organizational structures that would best meet the needs of the nation in this rapidly changing environment. 

Broader Impacts:
New paradigms are rapidly emerging for learning and education that challenge the use of cyber-infrastructure as a platform for enhancing knowledge communities and for expanding their scope and participation unconstrained by time and distance. Our world has entered a period of rapid and profound economic, social, and political transformation driven by knowledge and innovation. Much of this workshop focus is to set an agenda for understanding the rapidly changing needs of society for workforce learning and skills, new knowledge, research, innovation, and creativity in a world increasingly integrated and transformed by digital technology. The impact of demographic change, workplace needs (adaptive, ubiquitous, and lifelong learning opportunities), and learning structures (explicit, tacit, and intuitive knowledge) are considered as well as redesigns for learning systems at the K-12, higher education, workplace, and lifelong learning.

Some believe that today we are on the precipice of an era of extraordinary change as such disruptive technologies challenge the traditional paradigms of teaching and research. Some even suggest that traditional learning institutions such as the university could be swamped by a tsunami of new technology-based applications such as massively open online courses (MOOCS), learning analytics, or cognitive tutors that replace faculty. Research are also changing rapidly with the massive data sets (""big data""), powerful search engines to identify correlations, and cloud computing that enable social networking to engage large communities in scientific endeavors.The workshop and colloquium supported by this NSF grant first brought together a large number of thought leaders in the field of cyber-enabled learning and discovery to consider developments and possibilities in this field, and then followed by sharing their ideas with two dozen leaders of major universities from around the world (the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia). Although emerging technologies such as MOOCs and analytics have received great attention as possible game changers, the researchers, scholars, educators, and university leaders participating in these events caution that there was still a very great need for rigorous experimentation and measurement before more conventional approaches to teaching, research, and engagement with society were set aside. Yet it was also important to place before these groups, involving as they did leaders from higher education, industry, and government, the very real potential of these technologies to drive significant, disruptive change in the conventional paradigms for learning and discovery.

Broader Impact: Today our world has entered a period of rapid and profound economic, social, and political transformation driven by knowledge and innovation. Educated people, the knowledge they produce, and the innovation and entrepreneurial skills they possess have become the keys to economic prosperity, public health, national security, and social well-being. Much of the focus of this NSF workshop, bringing together many of the leaders of computer and communications technology with leading researchers and educators, was to set an agenda for understanding the rapidly changing needs of society for workforce learning and skills, new knowledge, research, innovation, and creativity in a world increasingly integrated and transformed by digital technology. The differing priorities for learning and discovery were examined at the level of individuals, organizations, nations, and the world. The impact of demographic change, workplace needs (adaptive, ubiquitous, and lifelong learning opportunities), and learning structures (explicit, tacit, and intuitive knowledge) were considered, along with recent technology-based applications such as massively open online courses (MOOCs), learning analytics, social network, data mining, and cloud technologies. The possibility of radical redesigns for learning institutions at the K-12, higher education, workplace, and lifelong learning were suggested considered. The results of this workshop were then conveyed several months later to two dozen leaders of the worldÆs major universities at a major colloquium to understand better how their universities were planning and adapting to the possibility of disruptive change in teaching and research that will likely be driven by these technologies.

138,"ABSTRACT 
This EAGER award creates an interoperability test bed to identify the components of an effective layered architecture for geoscience and environmental science research. In a layered architecture, every layer consists of different technologies, each of which uses different interaction protocols. The proposed project will examine a wide variety of existing technologies in terms of their effectiveness in working across present data silos. These technologies include data grids, workflow systems, policy management systems, web visualization services, and security protocols that work with various repository catalogs. Project goals are focused on developing cyberinfrastructure tools and approaches that allow geoscience data repositories to enable new science and more effectively make their data holdings discoverable and available to the public. Essential elements of the project include the collection and comparision of various approaches and existing tools to check effectiveness in handling and integrating geoscience data, and by automating processes needed to integrate various databases and data types. The project is led by a team of experts in cyberinfrastructure and geoscience data management and employs a spiral softwar3ee development approach. Broader impacts of the work include building infrastructure for science in order to facilitate data-enabled science in the geosciences. It will also produce results that are likely to be applicable to fields outside of the geosciences. The effort supports a larger NSF effort to establish a new paradigm in the development of an integrative and interoperable data and knowledge management system for the geosciences for a new NSF initiative called EarthCube.",NSF,4900,WOODS HOLE OCEANOGRAPHIC INSTITUTION,183 OYSTER POND ROAD,WOODS HOLE,US,Woods Hole,MA09,Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,MA,025431041,47.050,,03/28/2012,001766682,26895,03/31/2013,4900,GEOINFORMATICS,26895,1239702,001766682,Janet  Fredericks,,,US,Woods Hole,MA09,Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,MA,025431041,jfredericks@whoi.edu,Janet,Fredericks,,5082892573,bransom@nsf.gov,Barbara L. Ransom,7032928581,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"National data cyber-infrastructure in support of the Geo-Science Directorate can be implemented through use of data grid technology that integrates existing data management capabilities. The types of existing infrastructure include distributed sensors, data repositories, metadata catalogs, web services, workflow systems, community physics models, and knowledge management systems. Data grids provide virtualization mechanisms to manage interactions with the security, access, authentication, authorization, accounting, and auditing protocols that govern interactions with each system. Data grids also provide the mechanisms (soft links) for building a collaboration environment in which a researcher can register data from remote repositories, register workflows, and manage provenance information needed to re-create research results. A reasonable goal is the creation of cyber infrastructure that facilitates reproducible science.

Intellectual Merit: The interoperability testbed identifies the components of a layered architecture that enable Geo-Science research. The layers can be differentiated into applications and clients, virtualization and integration mechanisms, facilities, and federation systems. Each layer is represented by multiple existing technologies, which may use different interaction protocols. The data grid virtualization layer enables the integration across the multiple protocols, and seamless access to the rich set of Geo-science technologies that exist today.  The technologies considered for integration were production systems supported by collaborating team members. The technologies included data grids (GMU geospatial data grid, iRODS, DataONE OneDrive), workflow systems (iRODS, NCSA Cyberintegrator, UCSD Kepler, GMU BPELPower), policy management systems (iRODS, NCSA Cyberintegrator), web services (OGC Sensor Web Enablement standard (SWE), WHOI observation assessment (SWE), NCSA Semantic Geostreaming toolkit (SWE, W3C), GMU Geospatial client), web visualization services (GRASS, Colorado State University NextGen Network Enabled Weather), network and security protocols (iRODS - Grid Security Infrastructure, Kerberos, Shibboleth, Reliable Blast UDP, parallel TCP/IP), repositories (NOAA CLASS, NASA Echo, GEOSS ClearingHouse), catalogs (GMU GI-Cat, CUAHSI), community physics models (UC Boulder Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System, UNC RHESSys), and federation systems (iRODS, CLASS).

Broader Impacts: A high impact focus was on the creation of infrastructure that helps a researcher automate the analysis tasks. This is a collaboration environment in which a researcher can automate data retrieval, register workflows, manage sensor and workflow provenance, link research data sets to analysis workflows, share data and workflows, and re-execute workflows with revised input parameters. The goal is to facilitate research by providing an environment that manages interactions with community resources, while enabling a researcher to manage the active research products. The collaboration environment is highly extensible, enabling research initiatives that span multiple disciplines. The environment is highly controlled, enabling a researcher to either share research with collaborators, or formally publish results, or preserve research in an archive. Through federation with similar systems used in federal agencies, the goal is seamless access to community resources for all Geo-Science researchers.

139,"Given the complexity and seriousness of the disaster response environment, there is an urgent need for a wireless adhoc and sensor network cyberinfrastructure that integrates responders and supporting networks. The cyberinfrastructure must enhance robustness and efficiency of the integrated networks and provide mechanisms to dynamically modify network behavior in response to changing conditions. Similar efforts have made contributions in surveillance, tracking, and healthcare but fail to address the scale, complexity and robustness required by disaster response.

Intellectual merit: This project develops a cyberinfrastructure consisting of a set of new protocols, software components and analysis to support disaster response. The cyberinfrastructure is designed for the alternately congested and sparse environments typical of disasters where conventional infrastructure is unavailable. A spectrum-aware, multi-channel MAC protocol improves energy efficiency of compressed sensing applications, by minimizing congestion through intelligent use of multiple channels. On-demand routing provides end-to-end delay guarantees at optimal data rates. Adaptive tuning improves performance and minimizes negative interactions. The architecture provides a robust, energy-efficient framework tailored to disaster response operations.
Broader impact: The project will provide the first cyberinfrastructure for emergency response, integrating wireless sensor networks, adhoc networks deployed in a realistic environment. The research results will augment current course offerings at the graduate and undergraduate levels. The project will create a high school-level show-and-tell lecture on wireless adhoc and sensor networks in disaster response to be delivered at a local high school. Finally, the project will integrate the proposed cyberinfrastructure with Texas Task Force 1, the main state agency responsible for coordinating urban search and rescue and one of six teams selected by FEMA to provide response to Chemical, Biological, Radiological/Nuclear, and Explosive incidents.",NSF,4900,TEXAS A&M ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,TEES State Headquarters Bldg.,College Station,US,College Station,TX17,Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station,TX,778454645,47.070,,07/06/2011,847205572,300000,08/31/2015,4900,SOFTWARE DEVELOPEMENT FOR CI,322000,1127449,847205572,Radu  Stoleru,,,US,College Station,TX17,Texas Engineering Experiment Station,TX,778431226,stoleru@cse.tamu.edu,Radu,Stoleru,,9798628349,kthompso@nsf.gov,Kevin L. Thompson,7032928970,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Large scale disasters like the earthquake and tsunami in Japan (2011) cripple the local infrastructure. Proprietary systems and protocols used today for disaster response still lack data at the high spatial and temporal resolution needed to quickly save lives and to support disaster recovery efforts. Victims may be rescued after days, if not weeks; digital coordination interfaces among responders are often lacking, or are sometimes based on archaic methods (pencil, paper, paint on walls); the delay in receiving vast amounts of information from the field is still bounded by the time used to physically transport media containing the data.

This project developed a cyber-infrastructure for emergency response, through research and development for wireless sensor networks, adhoc networks, delay tolerant networks and social/opportunistic networks. We designed, implementated and evaluated DistressNet, a system that provides services for emergency response applications. DistressNet integrates a variety of rapidly deployable, battery powered common-off-the-shelf devices into a secure framework. An optimal placement of networked components allows users to quickly and reliably store and retrieve data, in a ??cloud??-like manner, from a local intermittently connected ??fog??. High volumes of field data are available for emergency response personnel to view and to process (thought solutions like MapReduce) on interfaces like smartphones and tablets. DistressNet also developed solutions for: wireless coexistence issues (when different wireless technologies, e.g., WiFi and ZigBee, are deployment simultaneously, as in a disaster, and affect each other negatively), distributed processing of big data when cloud infrastructure is not reachable (due to wireless connectivity problems, as in a disaster) and wireless security with constrainted resources (as it is the case in disaster environments).

The intellectual merit of this projects consists of the following: i) the project designed and implementated a complex system (i.e., sensing, networking, data management) for emergency response that addresses US&amp;R responder requirements and was evaluated in a realistic environment, utilizing over 3500 man-hours worth of deployment experiences and data; ii) the project developed a FogNet service which enables constant availability of external cloud services over a local, disconnected delay tolerant network; iii) this project developed applications that allow continuous monitoring of a large number of collapsed buildings for survivors, in stark contrast with today?s state of art, requiring responders to be physically present in the field, and requiring no noisy activity, interfering with their acoustic monitoring; iv) this project developed a solution that optimizes the aggregate throughput of data flows in a heterogeneous delay tolerant network based on vehicle mobility and per-contact data transfers, made possible by placing a few additional devices; v) this project developed the first analysis for saturation throughput for symmetric coexistence of WiFi and ZigBee and implemented and evaluated methods for performance tuning of each protocol, under coexistence; vi) this project developed a distributed computing infrastructure, based on Hadoop MapReduce, for processing large amounts of data produced by responders and sensors in a disaster area. DistressNet, through a novel filesystem, enables Hadoop MapReduce across mobile devices while addressing the security requirements of the users; vii) this project developed a novel Intrusion Detection solution for resource constrained mesh networks deployed in disaster areas.

This project supported and enabled the research/dissertations of three PhD students and 4 MS students. All software components of the system have been released as open source. DistressNet has been a large cyber-infrastructure effort, proposing open systems, instead of proprietary solutions. It has been developed in collaboration with Texas Task Force 1 and its components have been evaluated for over 4 years.

140,"The Quake-Catcher Network (QCN) is a transformative approach to earthquake detection, science, and outreach. The QCN is a distributed computing project that links internal (no cost, built-in) or external (low cost, USB-based) accelerometers connected to any participating computer for earthquake research.
Leveraging an innovative set of cyber-enabled seismic observations, this approach will enable the creation of a very dense, low-cost seismic network that can explore earthquake fault rupture in real-time, establish ground response to seismic wave passage, and quantify the shaking effects on critical structures. Results from a one-year exploratory grant from the NSF Cyber-Infrastructure Teaching, Education, Advancement and Mentoring program indicate QCN has the ability to be a new and transformative type of network, which is scalable and easy to deploy world-wide. Increasing the number of QCN sensors from 1,000 to more than 30,000 worldwide and developing efficient schemes to ingest, process, and distribute Terabytes of data will allow us to (1) explore fault mechanics (including directionality, slip distribution, and rupture velocity) at unprecedented resolutions, (2) study ground motions to assess seismic hazard and building response and (3) analyze data in real time for earthquake early warning and rapid response. This proposal will result in network with 6,000 new USB sensors and tens of thousands of no-cost sensors
commonly built internal to laptops and other devices. Additionally, QCN will provide the cyberinfrastructure to process and analyze the large new seismic data sets in near-real time and to foster collaboration between 1000?s of researchers and interested participants around the world. The framework
laid by this project will enable rapid expansion of the network internationally and will allow us to grow the network at a fraction of the cost of traditional seismic instrumentation and infrastructure, providing valuable data to augment the existing seismic networks.The success of the Quake-Catcher Network is intrinsically linked to the broader participation of the general public; members of the public, schools (K-12, undergraduate and graduate), and community organizations host QCN sensors. These ?citizen-scientists? will receive real-time earthquake information, seismic data and results, and interactive educational materials.",NSF,4900,"LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR UNIVERSITY, THE",3160 Porter Drive,Palo Alto,US,Palo Alto,CA18,Stanford University,CA,943041212,47.050,['Jack W Baker'],09/24/2010,009214214,759025,09/30/2014,4900,CDI TYPE II,759025,1027802,009214214,Jesse F Lawrence,3160 Porter Drive,Palo Alto,US,Palo Alto,CA18,Stanford University,CA,943041212,jfl77@stanford.edu,Jesse,Lawrence,F,6507232300,ezanzerk@nsf.gov,Eva E.

We developed a cyber-social-seismic network for monitoring earthquakes.  We demonstrated that the new micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) sensors were useful for locating and characterizing earthquake ground shaking.  We were able to detect and characterize hundreds earthquakes.

By providing sensors to teachers, we were able to increase the effecacy of earthquake instruction at K-12 levels.  We collaborated with a series of earthquake outreach specialists, including IRIS and SCEC to reach a broader audience, including a network of museums, in which QCN is a prominent exhibit.

We demonstrated that MEMS technology and a cyber-social-seismic network could be used for rapid earthquake detection and potentially even earthquake early warning (particularly when blended with more traditional earthquake monitoring equipment).  The accelerations recorded on Quake-Catcher Network (QCN) sensors are equivalent to those recorded by other sensors, but with a bit more noise because they are near humans who make noise.

The infrastructure developed under this grant will perpetuate beyond the duration of this grant.  Mirror projects are currently running in Mexico, Taiwan and Europe.  Due to the low cost and high impact (education as well as science), this type of network is very appealing to scientists and earthquake hazard professionals in developing and developed countries.

It is imperative that researchers focus on the key challenges in building a trustworthy cyber infrastructure. To this end, this project consisted of the organization of two events aimed at training researchers, formulating long-term research agendas and strengthening the scientific communities in computer security.

The first was a Workshop on Trustworthy Computing, held October 24-26, 2010 in Arlington, Virginia. The second was a Summer School on Cryptography and the Principles of Software Security, held May 30 to June 1, 2012 at Penn State's main campus in State College, Pennsylvania.

Workshop on Trustworthy Computing
http://tc2010.cse.psu.edu/

The workshop focused on the NITRD Cybersecurity R&amp;D Themes from the Federal Cybersecurity Game-Change Research Agenda (""NITRD themes"", hereafter) and the general challenge of improving the Science of Cybersecurity.  The result of this workshop is a set of research challenges identified by the workshop participants proposed as key areas for scientific investigations for a future trustworthy cyber infrastructure.

The workshop was attended by over 95 security researchers, at a variety of levels of seniority, with experience in research topics related to the NITRD Themes and Science of Cybersecurity, and some of the researchers with the potential to impact these themes in the future.  The focus included not only research topics and potential directions, but also information about the government agencies' interest areas to foster future collaborations. Additionally, many of the sessions provided general guidance for junior researchers on research directions and sources of funding. Participants included representatives from academia, industry, and program management.

The main body of the workshop was organized around four keynotes, an NSF TC program overview, four technical panels, and two project management panels.  As the keynote speakers and panelists represented academia, industry, and program management, a variety of perspectives were presented.  In addition to the keynote speakers and panel sessions, a breakout session was held to collect the key research challenges for the NITRD themes and Science of Cybersecurity.  The breakouts offered the prospective PIs a chance to ask questions to the panel speakers in a smaller group and brainstorm together to develop sets of key research challenges.

NSF funding was used to support the travel and local costs of attendees as well as for the meeting space and audiovisual costs.

The lectures were held over three days, with additional activities scheduled to allow attendees to meet each other and the speakers and discuss research. Activities included a poster session where attendees presented recent work on topics related to the summer schools. 

NSF funding was crucial to the summer schools' organization, providing support for speakers' and participants' travel and local costs. Approximately half of the participants were supported (in part or in full) by the award.

The speakers' slides and materials and a list of attendees and posters are available on the school website: http://cpss2012.cse.psu.edu

142,"Bowie State University's Targeted Infusion Project, entitled: Enhancing the Undergraduate Chemistry Curriculum in the Natural Sciences Department, seeks a hands-on and interdisciplinary approach to chemistry courses for upper-level Biology majors. This requires new course development and the acquisition of various instruments and equipment to further enhance the teaching and research infrastructure. The project has five distinct goals: (1) develop and implement a Biochemistry Laboratory course that will be integrated into the current Biochemistry Lecture Course, (2) enhance the Organic Chemistry Lab II course curriculum with more inquiry based experiments, (3) acquire instrumentation to further develop the state-of-the-art teaching and research infrastructure in chemistry laboratories, (4) assess and evaluate student understanding of organic chemistry lecture and lab before and after the infusion of new instrumentation, updated experiments, and (5) disseminate project findings through journal articles, conferences and colloquia presentations.

Metrics and data concerning the overall effectiveness of the project were collected, analyzed and disseminated.

 

The intellectual merit of the project lies mainly in integrating hands-on experiments into organic and biochemistry courses within the biology undergraduate curriculum. The instrumentation, wherever feasible, is equipped with new generation software and hardware to facilitate data sharing, management and remote collection. Enhanced undergraduate education in both the classroom and the laboratory will result from remote access and associated cyber infrastructure capacities. An auxiliary user group of 8 faculty members will also utilize the requested instrumentation for research in diverse areas of chemistry and biological sciences.

 

Broader Impact: STEM undergraduates, mostly underrepresented minorities, received state- of-the art education and training in data acquisition and spectral analysis in biochemical and synthetic chemical sciences. Activities from this project provided valuable research capabilities and experience to all biology majors. The remote access capability added to the established network, thus facilitating all authorized user groups, from anywhere, to process, analyze, distribute, and discuss acquired data from the instrument. All students trained and educated as a result of the proposed Targeted Infusion were positioned for admittance in graduate school and employment in a constantly-evolving interdisciplinary biomedical workforce.

 

Outcomes:

Students involved in the project obtained proficiency in spectroscopic techniques and structure determination using mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy.

Students were trained on the newly acquired Agilent GS/MS system in which they became proficient in measuring the mass, and therefore the molecular weight of a molecule. They were also able to deduce structural information about a molecule by measuring the fragments produced when molecules are fragmented by the electron bombardment of the Mass spectrometer.

Students also became proficient in Infrared Spectroscopy thus capable of identifying certain molecular functional groups of organic compounds by transmitting electromagnetic radiation through compound samples and analyzing the corresponding percent transmittance and absorbance.

Student Achievements:

Trained undergraduate students were able to use the newly analytical equipment with minimal assistance from senior personnel.
Former students who participated in project year 1 and/or received training in year 2 on equipment purchased by the grant were accepted to professional or graduate school. 
We have trained approximately twenty students to date on the instrumentation. This we believed encouraged many of the students trained on the equipment to apply for other prestigious summer internship opportunities.
Several students obtained summer internships.

144,"CSR: Small: Scaling the Real-time Capabilities of Powertrain Controllers in Automotive Systems

ScratchPad Memory(SPM)-based many-core architecture is a promising concept to improve the real-time capability of computing systems required in safety-critical applications. Demonstrating the proposed approach for powertrain controllers is just the first step and has the potential to enable the rapidly increasing fields of internet-of-things (IoT), avionics, robotics, cyber-infrastructure, and much more. An open-source cycle-accurate simulator of the SPM-based many-core processor, and a low level virtual machine (llvm) compiler will be developed as the outcome of this research significantly advancing this technology. 

This project will develop architecture, compilation, scheduling techniques, and real- time analysis to scale up the real-time capabilities of powertrain controllers of automotive systems. Powertrain controller is a safety-critical, hard-real-time controller in modern automobiles, directly responsible for the operation of the engine and transmission. The complexity of powertrain control applications is rapidly increasing in a quest to fulfill increasingly stringent regulations on the fuel- efficiency and emissions. To meet this demand, the real-time capability of powertrain engine control units (ECU) must also improve. Real-time capability of a processor is essentially a measure of how many/complex/frequent tasks can be guaranteed to finish in given deadlines. The challenge is that the real-time capability of a processor cannot be improved by traditional performance enhancing techniques, e.g., increasing frequency, adding more on-chip memory, or by adding caches. This research will employ (SPMs) instead of caches to improve the real-time capability of powertrain ECUs.  SPM partitioning, mapping/scheduling, SPM management techniques and real-time analyses for SPM-based many-core architecture (in which each core has an SPM instead of a cache) will be developed. This will be done for two data management schemes: one for task-level management, where all the code and data of the task are brought into the SPM at the beginning of the task and the other for function-level management, which enables executing applications on processors with much smaller SPM sizes, and can still be efficient through various compiler optimizations.",NSF,4900,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY,ORSPA,TEMPE,US,Tempe,AZ09,Arizona State University,AZ,852816011,47.070,,08/18/2015,943360412,449506,09/30/2019,4900,Computer Systems Research (CSR,449506,1525855,806345658,Aviral  Shrivastava,,,US,Tempe,AZ09,Arizona State University,AZ,852876011,aviral.shrivastava@asu.edu,Aviral,Shrivastava,,4807276509,mmcclure@nsf.gov,M.

145,"The problem of cyber-security encompasses computer systems of all sizes and affects almost all aspects of our day-to-day lives. This makes it fundamentally important to detect accurately and respond quickly to cyber-threats as they develop. This project aims to develop techniques and tools that can accelerate the process of understanding and responding to new cyber-threats as they develop.  The authors of malicious software (malware) usually try to make the malware stealthy in order to avoid detection. In many cases, this involves a variety of techniques aimed at hindering analysis efforts by security analysts; we refer to such techniques as anti-analysis defenses. When confronted by such defenses, security analysts have to identify and disable them in order to observe and understand its real behaviors and thereby develop countermeasures. Current approaches for doing this are slow and cumbersome. This project aims to develop highly general, efficient, and robust automated techniques for speeding up the process of identifying and understanding anti-analysis defenses in malware, with the goal of providing security analysts with tools that can help them respond quickly to new cyber-threats as they develop.

Malicious software (malware) usually employs a variety of anti-analysis and anti-tampering defenses to hinder analysis and reverse engineering. Currently, neutralizing such defenses requires a lot of manual intervention and is therefore tedious and time-consuming. This project develops semantics-based techniques to automate most or all of this effort and so accelerate the process of identifying and neutralizing such defenses.  The project focusses on analyzing programs that employ a variety of anti-analysis and anti-tampering defenses. In particular, the project will focus on the following research questions:
* Detection. How do characterizations of environmental observations translate to detection algorithms for anti-analysis defenses? How can the detection algorithms be made general?
* Precision. What factors affect the precision of such detection algorithms? How can the precision be improved?
* Performance. Sophisticated analysis of low-level code can be expensive. At the same time, the high volumes of new malware that are encountered make it important for analyses to be efficient. How can such detection algorithms be made efficient enough to be practical?
*Stealthy Defenses. How can environment checks be made statically and dynamically stealthy? What are the implications for anti-analysis detection algorithms?

In order for such anti-anti-analysis techniques to have longevity, it is important that they be general, i.e., make as few assumptions as possible about the nature or form of the defenses that may have been applied. To this end, the project will articulate explicitly the assumptions underlying the techniques it develops. This can be expected to suggest new directions for research by indicating where assumptions may be weakened or removed. The potential contributions of this research are both technical and societal. The ability to more easily neutralize anti-analysis defenses deployed by malware will allow security researchers to respond to new and emerging malware threats quickly. This will have the effect of limiting the scope of the damage caused by such malware, and improve the security and reliability of our cyber-infrastructure. Additionally, the project will involve graduate and undergraduate students in all aspects of the research and thereby contribute to the development of a highly skilled workforce. Finally, software developed as part of the project will be made available to the broader research community, thereby assisting and supporting other research projects in this area.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,888 N Euclid Ave,Tucson,US,Tucson,AZ03,University of Arizona,AZ,857194824,47.070,['Christian S Collberg'],08/14/2015,806345617,514796,08/31/2019,4900,Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace,546740,1525820,072459266,Saumya K Debray,Gould-Simpson Building 1040 E. 4,Tucson,US,Tucson,AZ03,University of Arizona,AZ,857210077,debray@cs.arizona.edu,Saumya,Debray,K,5206214527,sgreensp@nsf.gov,Sol J.

Novel hybrid materials result when nanoparticles are dispersed in a matrix.  How the nanoparticles are arranged in the matrix critically affects the properties and the performance of the resulting hybrid materials.  Most current work in this field is in a ""discovery"" mode: one starts with a given nanoparticle building block (NBB), and then uses theory/simulation to model the processing steps to create the NBB assemblies and compute their properties.  While this discovery mode is useful for understanding experimental results a-posteriori, the real interest is in a-priori designing NBB that can assemble into functional structures with pre-determined properties.  The structures may develop under ""equilibrium"" or may be frozen in structures that can be tuned through the use of appropriate processing, e.g., through the application of strong flow fields such as in an extruder.  Currently, this ""reverse"" or design goal is only achieved in a trial-and-error manner. 

Intellectual Merit

This project has two overarching themes: First, a cyber-infrastructure will be developed to realize the goal of a-priori NBB design. A crucial difficulty in this context is that such a design process requires expertise in both materials science and scientific computing/software engineering, e.g., to properly model the NBBs, integrate various pieces of software, and parallelize critical components to run on specialized computer architectures, such as graphical processing units (GPUs).  Such broad-based capabilities are out of reach of most current practitioners.  To circumvent this difficulty, the second interrelated goal of this work is to develop model-integrated computing (MIC) based tools, so that the computational design of materials can be decoupled from the design and implementation of simulation-based experiments.  The project is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor because it attempts to abstract the deep human expertise currently required for the development of such simulation-based experiments. 

Broader Impact

The research effort will enrich and complement innovative educational and outreach activities.  In particular, an annual Computational ""cyber camp"" will be conducted, in which all students (undergraduates and graduates), post-docs and faculty funded by this grant, and external collaborators will participate.  Partnerships with HBCU institutions will allow for recruiting minority REU students, who can spend time at the cyber camp, with the ultimate goal of recruitment and retention.",NSF,4900,"TRUSTEES OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK, THE",2960 Broadway,NEW YORK,US,New York,NY10,Columbia University,NY,100276902,47.041,,09/22/2010,049179401,570000,09/30/2014,4900,CDI TYPE II,570000,1028299,049179401,Sanat K Kumar,2960 Broadway,NEW YORK,US,New York,NY10,Columbia University,NY,100276902,sk2794@columbia.edu,Sanat,Kumar,K,2128542193,@nsf.gov,,,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Our overarching goal in this project was to develop modeling techniques that would allow us to design nanoscale building blocks (NBBs) that would assemble into desired superstructures. If successful, this would allow us to create materials that could in principle have the desired (presumably optimized) properties. Our major advance in this project has been to establish a quantitative analogy between polymer grafted nanoparticles (PGNPs) and patchy nanoparticles (NPs). We used a combination of computer simulations to develop this analogy, and then validated these results in the context of our previous experimental studie and those of other workers in this field. Over much of the experimentally relevant parameter space, we show that PGNPs behave quantitatively like Janus NPs, with the patch size having a universal dependence on the number of grafts and the ratio of the size of the NPs to the grafted chain size. The widely observed anisotropic self-assembly of PGNP into superstructures can thus be understood through simple geometric considerations of single patch models, in the same spirit as the geometry-based surfactant models of Israelachvili. These ideas allow us to thus construct simple coarse grained models of PGNPs, which thus allow us to design the building blocks that will assemble into any desired structure.

147,"Newly formed atmospheric aerosol particles exert a considerable impact on global climate by affecting the Earth's radiation balance.  Nucleation plays a pivotal role in the formation of these particles.  Understanding how particles nucleate in a multi-component gas mixture has important implications not only for climate and weather but also wide-ranging technological applications including gas separations, pollution control, and nanotechnology.  Atmospheric nucleation involves multi-scale processes ranging from proton transfer to molecular condensation and evaporation events and culminating in the rare formation of the critical nucleus.  The goals of this project are (i) to develop computational algorithms and analysis tools for efficient investigations of multi-component gas-to-particle nucleation processes, (ii) to elucidate atmospherically relevant nucleation processes and to validate the rate predictions through strategically selected laboratory experiments measuring cluster size and mass distributions at the sub-3 nm scale, and (iii) to deploy a freely-available cyber-tool that transforms data to knowledge by enabling large-scale modelers and experimental researchers to harvest predicted atmospheric nucleation rates and learn about mechanisms, by providing a general framework to visualize and analyze the abundance of digital data generated by particle-based simulations for any type of gas-to-particles nucleation process, and by being an aid for teaching about nucleation.

The project impacts our understanding of atmospheric nucleation pathways and sheds light on how quantitative modeling of the nucleation kinetics affects global climate models and impacts the ability to influence atmospheric nucleation.  Driven by the partnership of researchers from different fields, diverse academic institutions, and international collaborators, the education, training, and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students is advanced in a unique way that broadens participation.  Knowledge gained from this project infuses the excitement of discovery in courses and laboratories taught by the team members.  Outreach activities to junior high schools and science museums allow a broader community to learn about atmospheric nucleation.

The objective of this project is to develop a Systems Security and Software Security in Senior Projects (S4-SP) program to incorporate aspects of software security, computer, network, operating systems and database security into all phases of capstone projects. The four major goals of the S4-SP program are: (a) develop course modules in the areas of systems security, software security and cryptography; (b) integrate and use the course modules in the Software Engineering and Senior Capstone Project courses; (c) develop a Virtual Security Lab (VS Lab) that can be remotely used by other institutions; and (d) develop a sequence of two elective courses on Systems Security and Advanced Information.

The S4-SP program establishes a model for incorporating aspects of systems security and software security in a capstone project. The security learning modules are self-contained and no prior security background is required. The security control implementations in the Senior Projects are platform-independent.

JSU is a Historically Black University (HBCU) and more than 90% of its students are African-Americans. Other HBCUs and smaller institutions can efficiently incorporate the security modules as an essential component of their undergraduate Computer Science curriculum without requiring a dedicated security course. The Virtual Security Lab is accessible to other institutions at no additional cost.",NSF,4900,JACKSON STATE UNIVERSITY,1400 J R LYNCH ST.,Jackson,US,Jackson,MS02,Jackson State University,MS,392170002,47.076,"['Loretta A Moore', 'Hyunju  Kim']",09/11/2010,044507085,199986,08/31/2014,4900,CCLI-Type 1 (Exploratory),199986,0941959,044507085,Natarajan  Meghanathan,1400 J R LYNCH ST.,Jackson,US,Jackson,MS02,Jackson State University,MS,392170002,natarajan.meghanathan@jsums.edu,Natarajan,Meghanathan,,6019793661,vpiotrow@nsf.gov,Victor P.

A culture of incorporating cyber security in all the phases of a software lifecycle (requirement, design, coding/development, testing, installation and maintenance) evolved among the Computer Science majors during the period of the TUES project.

 

The TUES project facilitated us to setup a cloud cyber infrastructure that could be used to host virtual machine servers for students to remotely login and do their course projects. The virtual machine images could be customized for the needs of the students taking the specific classes.

 

The TUES project contributed to the development of a suite of three security courses in the undergraduate computer science curriculum at Jackson State University. The three security courses developed and taught during the funding period of the project are: CSC 437 Computer Security, CSC 438 Systems and Software Security and CSC 439 Advanced Information Security. All the course materials are available online in the website of the Principal Investigator (PI): http://www.jsums.edu/cms/nmeghanathan as well as in the TUES project website: http://www.jsums.edu/cms/tues.

 

The TUES project gave an opportunity for the PI to embark more on cyber security-related research projects and thereby integrate education with research. The PI conducted research on topics such as source code analysis for software security, secure communication protocols, virtualization and cloud computing and published peer-reviewed articles, and integrated some of the research methodologies and results into the course modules and lab projects developed for the above three cyber security courses.

The objective of this research is the development of methods for the control of energy flow in buildings, as enabled by cyber infrastructure. The approach is inherently interdisciplinary, bringing together electrical and mechanical engineers alongside computer scientists to advance the state of the art in simulation, design, specification and control of buildings with multiple forms of energy systems, including generation and storage. A significant novelty of this project lies in a fundamental view of a building as a set of overlapping, interacting networks. These networks include the thermal network of the physical building, the energy distribution network, the sensing and control network, as well as the human network, which in the past have been considered only separately. This work thus seeks to develop methods for simulating, optimizing, modeling, and control of complex, heterogeneous networks, with specific application to energy efficient buildings. The advent of maturing distributed and renewable energy sources for on-site cooling, heating, and power production and the concomitant developments in the areas of cyberphysical and microgrid systems present an enormous opportunity to substantially increase energy efficiency and reduce energy-related emissions in the commercial building energy sector. In addition, there is a direct impact of the proposed work in training students with backgrounds in the unique blend of engineering and computer science that is needed for the study of cyber-enabled energy efficient management of structures, as well as planned interactions at the undergraduate and K-12 level.",NSF,4900,TRUSTEES OF THE COLORADO SCHOOL OF MINES,1500 Illinois,Golden,US,Golden,CO07,Colorado School of Mines,CO,804011887,47.070,"['Kevin L Moore', 'Dinesh P Mehta', 'Marcelo G Simoes', 'Siddharth  Suryanarayanan', 'Robert J Braun']",08/15/2009,010628170,1406023,08/31/2013,4900,CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (CPS),1406023,0931748,010628170,Tyrone L Vincent,1500 Illinois,Golden,US,Golden,CO07,Colorado School of Mines,CO,804011887,tvincent@mines.edu,Tyrone,Vincent,L,3032733641,dcorman@nsf.gov,David Corman,7032928950,040101 RRA RECOVERY ACT,,"['Sanandaji, BM;Vincent, TL;Wakin, MB~Concentration of Measure Inequalities for Compressive Toeplitz Matrices with Applications to Detection and System Identification~49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)~ ~2010~~2922~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=201462335#000295049103061', 'Wakin, MB;Sanandaji, BM;Vincent, TL~On the Observability of Linear Systems from Random, Compressive Measurements~49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)~ ~2010~~4447~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=201463515#000295049105017', 'Paire, D;Simoes, MG;Lagorse, J;Miraoui, A~A real-time sharing reference voltage for hybrid generation power system~Annual Meeting on IEEE Industry-Applications-Society~ ~2010~~ ~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=195135874#000287415300046', 'Kouri, T;Mehta, D~Improved Automated Reaction Mapping~10th International Symposium on Experimental Algorithms~6630~2011~~157~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=205235393#000301803700014', 'Sanandaji, BM;Vincent, TL;Wakin, MB~Compressive Topology Identification of Interconnected Dynamic Systems via Clustered Orthogonal Matching Pursuit~50th IEEE Conference of Decision and Control (CDC)/European Control Conference (ECC)~ ~2011~~174~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=206888864#000303506200028', 'Toth, R;Sanandaji, BM;Poolla, K;Vincent, TL~Compressive System Identification in the Linear Time-Invariant Framework~50th IEEE Conference of Decision and Control (CDC)/European Control Conference (ECC)~ ~2011~~783~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=206889311#000303506201061', 'Sanandaji, BM;Vincent, TL;Wakin, MB;Toth, R;Poolla, K~Compressive System Identification of LTI and LTV ARX Models~50th IEEE Conference of Decision and Control (CDC)/European Control Conference (ECC)~ ~2011~~791~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=206889316#000303506201062', 'Sanandaji, BM;Vincent, TL;Wakin, MB~Exact Topology Identification of Large-Scale Interconnected Dynamical Systems from Compressive Observations~American Control Conference (ACC)~ ~2011~~649~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=201748281#000295376001027', 'Zhao, P;Suryanarayanan, S;Simoes, MG~An Energy Management System for Building Structures Using a Multi-Agent Decision-Making Control Methodology~Annual Meeting on IEEE Industry-Applications-Society~ ~2010~~ ~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=195135896#000287415300050']","['Crabtree, JD;

150,"This award provides support to conduct a 2-day workshop organized by the International Society of Service Innovation Professionals, ISSIP, to take place in the winter of 2017 in Silicon Valley, California.  The workshop will bring together industry and academic researchers from around the country and the world. Industrial and academic participants who are considered thought leaders from a variety of academic fields and areas of application will discuss a long-term human-technology research agenda that will enable the smart service systems of the future. 

Service systems contribute to more than 75% of the U.S. GDP and provide close to 80% of employment. It has been demonstrated that the integration of technology as an aid to the human worker can result in dramatic improvements in productivity by augmenting human capabilities in the workplace. Hence, in the next few decades technology-based innovations in service systems can have enormous economic importance for the United States. Smart service systems also have the potential to become the conduit for social innovations addressing major societal problems. 

The agenda of the workshop can have transformative impact on the US economy and beyond by identifying the grand challenges that industry faces, not for today's service systems, but for the service systems envisioned in 20-30 years. The ultimate objective is to bring attention of academic research on technologies that neither industry nor academia are working on at the moment but that are necessary to enable this next generation of service systems.  

These futuristic services are likely to be enabled by the automation of the built environment capable of providing innovative services by teaming with humans for the benefit of individuals and society. Examples are those enabled by ambient intelligence, cognitive environments, virtual assistants, service robots, intelligent vehicles, smart infrastructure, and autonomous systems or intelligent devices of all sorts, all networked by the internet of things and other communication paradigms. The departments from where academic researchers will be drawn to work on these challenges will be diverse. Participants have been selected based on a broad range of expertise across a variety of research fields, including engineering, information technology, computer science, operations, optimization, and social and behavioral sciences. In particular, researchers who are already interested in trans-disciplinary collaborations will be invited. Industry researchers from Fortune 500 companies in the smart services space will be summoned. With more than a 1000 members with diverse backgrounds representing industry, academia, and government, ISSIP is uniquely positioned to convene this distinct group.

?    On people-technology symbiosis,  catalyze fundamental research in ""wisdom computing,"" i.e. research technologies that help people become wiser (Wisdom Computing) and to go beyond smart service systems (efficiency) toward wise service systems (sustainable innovation).  Study emergent phenomena in a network of robots and network of robots and humans. Study a network of robots with humans at the periphery, or part of the network - swarm intelligence -  with command and control, and emergent peer-peer scenarios.  Study scenarios of conflict.  How can wisdom be transferred to machines? How can machines develop their own wisdom? How can machines be controlled by human wisdom?  Research to study human identity when technology is augmenting human capability.

?    On People-Technology symbiosis to restore/augment/enhance physical human capabilities, foster human-centric research and education in cross-cutting disciplines such  as systems engineering and systems-of-systems research, data sciences, material sciences, human factors, etc. around themes such as mobility, personal transportation, human factors, aspects of health that are influenced by behavioral and human factors, human-compatible prosthetics/robotics, and bi-directional brain-computer interfaces,   encourage emergent,  experimental approaches to building ecosystems of innovation.

?      On People-Technology symbiosis to augment/enhance cognitive human capabilities, drive Citizen Science projects that result in generation and collection of relevant data. Consider university funding to build  ""charter city"" testbeds, requiring academia-industry collaboration with a long-term research horizon (10-15 years).

?      On Healthcare and Technology, develop a program to study and invite stakeholders to address the grand challenges for prevention of chronic diseases using crowdsourcing to scale. NSF Mechanics that might help include Seed grants, Center grants, Graduate research fellowships, Foundation/NSF partnerships, and Industry/NSF partnerships.

?      On Future Workforce Challenges, support the development of pilot ecosystems &ndash; with platforms for organizing work, workers, learners. Sponsor research to explore new paradigms of work and labor and training &ndash; focused on digital futures.  Support research in the wild &ndash; promote inclusivity, understand needs. Sponsor development of data-driven simulations of future workforce and training scenarios. Create centers of excellence (similar to NSF Science of Learning Centers) to promote interdisciplinary development of workforce, oriented to Ph.D. studies, with industry involvement: Sponsor Ph.D. studies in workforce futures. Support industry involvement in academe for scenario &amp; vision development. Build bridges, such as GOALI program. Support creation of journal that publishes interdisciplinary studies of workforce.

?      On working with Industry Challenges,  social-cyber-physical infrastructure and platform technologies can be used to expand social capabilities, and enhance university-industry collaborations, concerns, capabilities, possibilities, hindrances for alignment, and successes factors need to be studied as an interconnected service system - NSF could facilitate such a study/workshop with a goal to build innovation capacity and create jobs  (i.e. Innovation Matching Market study with impact to jobs, community, and society). NSF could also potentially facilitate a study to understand the flow of university IP revenue, ROI, and opportunity cost ( A similar study on the patent system was done by the National Academies, 2004 - www.nap.edu/catalog/10976/a-patent-system-for-the-21st-century). NSF could catalyze faculty level and graduate level C0-Ops to scale innovation and jobs through entrepreneurship. NSF could catalyze university incubation focused on industry-challenges. NSF could potentially fund the development of a people-cyber infrastructure to support industry-university collaboration, and startups, angels, and VC ecosystems.

?      On Advanced Manufacturing/Maker Collaboration (e.g., manufacturing on demand, etc.), Sharing Economy/Excess Capacity Utilization, NSF could drive a program that encourages industry engagement, where industry could provide a means for scaling and wide deployment.  Look for opportunities where this effort could be integrated into ongoing projects such as I-Core. Consider an ECR that brings the various aspect of this public-private partnership together, researches the long-term implications decentralized manufacturing, and focuses on the workforce development.

?      On IoT services, NSF could act as an accelerator to: 1)Drive industry-university translational research toward the proliferation of use cases and scalability, and especially security and trust. 2) Foster programs for development of innovative individual IoT elements, Integration of elements, and smart services.

151,"Lamar University is introducing a Science DMZ designed to efficiently achieve higher levels of performance, reliability and predictability for critical STEM science research projects and address next generation big data research needs.  The proposed cyber infrastructure provides connectivity to state and national high performance computing facilities, including those supported through the NSF/XSEDE program, from multiple research locations across campus.  Lamar University faculty research includes, but is not limited to, biology, chemistry, environmental science, electronic systems, biomedical diagnostics, natural disasters, engineering, and high performance computing and data analysis. 

The dedicated Science DMZ provides transformative capability for both research and educational programs by interconnecting research intensive areas on campus to one another through a 10G fiber backbone while removing obstacles to efficient data flows between research laboratories and external collaborative computational and analytical facilities.  The new design provides multiple 10Gbps-routed ports, DMZ switches for link consolidation and aggregation, a high performance data transfer node, and a Perfsonar node for performance monitoring and testing.  In addition, the optical fiber network is upgraded to single-mode fiber connections for research-intensive areas along with distribution and access layer switching to provide 10G capacity.

The new network also provides broader impact benefits to graduate and undergraduate students by incorporating project design and operation into classroom lecture, student engagement in intensive computational and data driven research and independent student research efforts.",NSF,4900,LAMAR UNIVERSITY,4400 Port Arthur Road,Beaumont,US,Beaumont,TX14,Lamar University Beaumont,TX,777055748,47.070,"['Lawrence J Osborne', 'Peter  Kelleher PhD', 'Sean P Stewart']",02/19/2016,967315706,376917,01/31/2018,4900,Campus Cyberinfrastrc (CC-NIE),376917,1541242,101405814,Priscilla  Parsons,,,US,Beaumont,TX14,Lamar University Beaumont,TX,777055748,priscilla.parsons@lamar.edu,Priscilla,Parsons,,4098807011,kthompso@nsf.gov,Kevin L.

The upgrades introduced a Science DMZ, upgraded campus network switching and fiber, and enabled high speed connections up to 10Gbps to upstream entities including LEARN, Internet 2, SETG, XSEDE, GENI and others, thus permitting researchers to efficiently access and transfer data necessary to the University's multi-disciplinary data-intensive research for the first time.  In addition, increases in bandwidth will continue to impact research for graduate and undergraduate students through utilization within classroom and independent research projects.  New faculty recruitments will have improved cyberinfrastructure with which to conduct research and collaborate with external research partners and will allow research and educational pursuits to more fully utilize connectivity to regional and national optical networks, specifically Lonestar Education and Research Network (LEARN) and Internet2.  The improvements to Lamar's networking infrastructure have led to further cyberinfrastructure improvements including high performance computing and the improved network design benefits all campus activities by providing important additional network capacity and throughput.  Implementation of the Science DMZ included enhanced organizational structures including a Science DMZ / research technology committee that will promote collaboration and efficiency, thereby enhancing the overall generation of knowledge that results form Lamar research programs.  Professional development opportunities provided technology staff as well as researchers with new knowledge and skills in the implementation and management of shared-service research technology.

152,"The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. Delaware State University will implement a project entitled: Expanding Educational Cyber-Infrastructure at Delaware State University. The project aims to integrate cyberlearning strategies into the biology curriculum to improve instruction and increase student achievement, retention and graduation in STEM fields.  Project objectives include expanding the institution's distance learning infrastructure; adapting cyberlearning approaches to enhance biology instruction; and adapting the technology-supported inverted classroom student-centered approach to teaching. In an inverted classroom, learning activities that are normally carried out inside the classroom, such as lecturing, take place outside of class, and learning activities that are normally completed at home, such as solving problems and applying the course concepts in homework assignments, become the focus of in-class work. This approach has been shown to be a powerful and empowering mode of instruction for all types of learners.  

Redesigned biology classes will have students doing the lower levels of cognitive work such as gaining knowledge and comprehension outside of class, and focusing on the higher forms of cognitive work such as application, analysis, synthesis, and/or evaluation in class, where they have the support of their peers and instructor.  A teaching approach that allows students to access course content in the same way that they access content related to their personal interests has the potential to increase their engagement with the material, while being able to control the pace and timing of their access can give them ownership of their learning. Educational literature has demonstrated that students learn best when they are active, engaged and learning for a purpose. The project will assess the efficacy of this course delivery model for supporting student learning and course performance over a wide variety of courses and instructors. If the project yields positive outcomes in student learning and course success with inverted versions of the biology courses from the introductory to the advanced level, it will provide a powerful model for STEM departments on campus and at other HBCUs.",NSF,4900,DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY,1200 N.

Rankins,7032928109,040106 NSF Education & Human Resource,"This project examined the effect that changing the way that Biology classes were delivered had on student success and their attitudes about themselves and their major. A total of six different instructors were involved and all of them changed from solely using lectures to present course material to developing other methods that required students to be more actively involved in classwork. In some courses all of the material was presented outside of class through the textbook and videos. This type of classroom is frequently called a ""flipped"" or ""inverted"" classroom. In others courses there was a mix of lecture with video and textbook supplementation added on. Classroom activities were developed which were designed to change students from being passive consumers of course material into active users of that material. The rationale behind this is that active users learn the material better than those that interact with the material passively. These activities ranged from long-term problem-based projects to group or individual questions. Each professor was free to develop their own individual solutions to the task of delivering course material in new and innovative ways. Technological and professional development support was provided to the faculty members to help them make the transition to teaching methods that are more focused on active involvement of students in their learning.

 

After four years, we saw that more students were successful in their second and third year core courses than we saw previously; passing rates of around 90% were seen in the final year of the project. Students also showed positive changes in their attitudes towards completing their major and towards science in general. Outcomes were more complicated for first-year students, though their courses weren?t officially part of the project, we still monitored them since they were the students who populated the targeted second and third year courses. Students showed negative attitude changes in their first semester followed by improvement in the second. There was some improvement in how many students passed the first semester course but it wasn?t a strong or persistent change. There was a much larger improvement in the second semester with pass rates ranging from 80 to 85 percent. Overall, we can say that changing the courses had a positive impact on our students? educational experience.

153,"Data-driven innovation requires a foundation of infrastructure to support the sharing, access, use, re-use, analysis, and stewardship of digital data. Data infrastructure includes cyber-infrastructure tools for data discovery and analysis (and their underlying technical structures and components -- persistent digital identifiers, shared metadata frameworks, etc.), and social infrastructure in the form of community policy and organizational practice (harmonization of standards, approaches for data access and preservation, etc.). To address the growing global need for data infrastructure, the Research Data Alliance (RDA) was planned and launched in FY13 as an international community-driven organization. RDA's mission is to build the social, organizational, and technical infrastructure needed to reduce barriers to data sharing and exchange, and to accelerate data-driven innovation world-wide. In the wake of precipitous growth, RDA is now working to develop a stable support model for at least a five-year period. The RDA 2 project provides support for U.S. participation and leadership within the RDA, as well as strategic expansion of the U.S. community within RDA (RDA/U.S.). RDA 2 integrates a) strategic efforts and pilots to expand, diversify, and strengthen the RDA/U.S. community, and b) support for U.S. contributions to RDA operations and leadership, including U.S. participation in, and hosting of, RDA Plenaries. RDA/U.S. will be led by a Steering Committee consisting of Fran Berman, RPI (Chair), Beth Plale, IU, (Vice Chair, Technical Programs), Larry Lannom, CNRI, (Vice Chair, Outreach and Development) and Mark Parsons, RPI (Managing Director).

The RDA 2 project builds RDA through increasing U.S. engagement and leadership. RDA 2 builds RDA/U.S. through pilots in three strategic areas: Community Engagement and Outreach, Student and Early Career Engagement, and Adoption and Impact Amplification. The pilots are designed to expand and diversify RDA/U.S. data community, increase the impact of RDA deliverables in the U.S., and enhance the benefit of RDA for U.S. institutions, communities, businesses, and individuals. A strong RDA/U.S. can be a vehicle for accelerating U.S. innovation, and positioning the U.S. community for greater competitiveness and leadership.

155,"This project will perform an in-depth study on the development of a framework for a cyberinfrastructure (CI) general practitioner education and internship program targeted at creating highly-capable and innovative information technology (IT) professionals. This project will establish a methodology by which to develop a prototype model that implements an applied internship program within an academic setting. This methodology will include evaluating both undergraduate and graduate curriculum content needs, exploring a set of desired practical workforce competencies, forging the appropriate mix of private sector partnerships, conducting a fit/gap analysis of current curriculum offerings, and developing the prototype offering of a CI general practitioner program that explores an internship style model for instructional delivery. 

The United States faces several challenges in addressing the necessary aptitudes that future information technology professionals will need. Traditional computer science and computer engineering degrees tend to focus only on theoretical foundations of computing, and these programs often lack the time to guide the students through a comprehensive apprenticeship program. Curriculum development programs that focus only on undergraduate education miss the large population of knowledgeable graduate-level student researchers who are often well prepared to employ practical cyberinfrastructure (CI) skills in advancing their research and teaching activities. A standardized educational model that enables both undergraduate and graduate students to gain much needed extracurricular CI skills does not exist. In addressing these challenges, this program will investigate the feasibility and needed components of a CI Practitioner program, which seeks to bridge the applied skills gaps between training programs currently offered by technical colleges, traditional university degree programs, and professional certification pathways in order to begin creating a workforce that possesses the theoretical foundation, hands-on capabilities, and technical skills needed to engage in and support CI-enabled science and innovation. The results of this study will be applicable at all institutions working toward a more relevant and more effective curriculum and internship program for preparing undergraduate or graduate students to become innovative and competitive in the technology driven global market. This project?s discoveries and curriculum model will be applicable within multiple disciplines, as CI benefit has no boundaries.  Beneficiaries of this work will include traditional CI-enabled sciences primarily, but also the humanities and economic endeavors.

The overall goal is to begin creating a workforce that possesses the theoretical foundation, hands-on capabilities, and technical skills needed to engage in and support cyberinfrastructure-enabled science and innovation.  This was achieved by taking on four major focus area: the creation of several new training workshops, the development of the cyberinfrastructure living laboratory, fostering student participation in industry events, and the development of a formal cyberinfrastructure curriculum by changing Clemson UniversityÆs existing Computer Information System B.S. degree program.

 

The addition of new training sessions and workshops was guided by student requests.  These training sessions included an introduction to Linux using desktop virtual machines, an introduction to network and information security, an introduction to Apache Hadoop, remote GPU visualization with VirtualGL, an advanced course in using the Linux command-line tools, and the programming languages C, FORTRAN, R, and MATLAB.

 

One of the largest and most challenging tasks has been the development of the CI living laboratory, which has involved major renovations and equipment installations in the room that was selected. An important factor in selecting a location for this laboratory was the need to have it centrally-located on our campus so that it would not be perceived as the domain of a particular department. For this reason, we elected to establish this laboratory in a preexisting meeting room within our campus's library. The CI living laboratory has been outfitted with a computational cluster, a visualization cluster, a tiled visualization wall, a software-defined networking switch, student laptops, high-definition video conferencing capability, and projectors.  Much of the core computational equipment needed for this type of laboratory comes with demanding power and cooling requirements. To address this issue, major renovations to the room were undertaken, required a great deal of early planning and anticipation of equipment use. The CI living laboratory space has also been expanded to include a new, smaller laboratory better suited for ongoing projects where long-term security of equipment and ""state-of-project"" issues (students needing to leave equipment in a particular state between sessions) can be addressed.

 

All students participating in this program have been strongly encouraged to join Clemson faculty and staff (or members of this project's leadership team) in attending local and national cyberinfrastructure-focused events such as SC13, SC14, GENI conferences, XSEDE14, XSEDE15, DEFCON, SIGGRAPH, and Clemson University's CI Expo. 

 

A preliminary review of the Clemson University School of ComputingÆs Computer Information Systems (CIS), Bachelor of Science (BS) degree program was performed to determine feasibility of changes to the curriculum designed to incorporate practical cyberinfrastructure (CI) knowledge components derived from this project.  However, other departments are now requesting similar curriculum changes. This interest is stemming from the fact that researchers need access to distributed data, advanced computing, and cloud infrastructures in order to be successful in their research and the education of their students. For this reason, we have changed our original focus from the CS curriculum into a more flexible framework that allows us to design training and internship modules that will couple directly into current and future curricula of departments at the university.

This project involves the renovation of cyberinfrastructure at 17 of the 36 sites in the University of California Natural Reserve System (NRS).  The renovation will update the telecommunications infrastructure at these sites, enabling the deployment of networks of sensors and instrumentation by researchers and transforming the flow of data to researchers.

The NRS is a network of 36 reserves that encompass more than 135,000 acres across twelve ecological regions in California.  The 17 reserves in the proposed project have older cyberinfrastructure in need of renovation and/or are heavily used by a wide variety of researchers.   13 of the 17 reserves to be renovated are ""full facility"" reserves, possessing the facilities, equipment, and professional staff necessary to support long-term research projects and multi-week field courses remote from campus services.  Several of the NRS reserves are testbeds for researchers developing novel ecological sensors and observing systems, including a range of new instruments and networked systems developed by the Center for Embedded Networked Sensing. The James Reserve is the site for the National Ecological Observatory Network's first Fundamental Instrument Unit prototype.  

The scope of research that will benefit from the renovation is broad.  The evolution of sensing technology is a driver for the need for reliable, low-cost broadband Internet access to the reserves and the instruments within them.  Research to be pursued includes how climate change will affect California's plant and animal species and the ecosystems that provide essential services such as fresh water.  Examples of projects that will make use of the renovated communications infrastructure include:  an investigation of the ecological links between rivers and upland areas; a study of how water moves through the landscape and into deeper, rocky geology; the development of a Stream Experimental and Observational Network; and the development of the Very Large Ecological Array, a new class of environmental sensor network intended to observe micro-environmental conditions above and below ground and plant phenology at multiple scales.

In addition to providing infrastructure for research, the University of California Natural Reserves are used by educational institutions within California, including those in the K-12 system and the state higher education system.   The reserves serve as training centers for students and teachers. Data from the reserves is available to students online, including climate data, hydrological data, ecological data, and webcam imagery.

The work proposed includes the upgrading of communications infrastructure at the following 17 reserves:  the Angelo Coast Range Reserve, Blue Oak Ranch Reserve, Boyd Deep Canyon Desert Research Center, Chickering American River Reserve, Coal Oil Point Natural Reserve, Dawson Los Monos Canyon Reserve, Elliott Chaparral Reserve, Hastings Reserve, James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve, Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve, Motte Rimrock Reserve, Sagehen Creek Field Station, Santa Cruz Island Reserve, Sedgwick Reserve, Sweeney Granite Mountains Desert Research Center, Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory, and Valentine Camp.",NSF,4900,THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,1111 Franklin Street,Oakland,US,Oakland,CA13,"University of California, Office of the President, Oakland",CA,946075200,47.083,"['Michael P Hamilton', 'Mark R Stromberg']",09/18/2010,003985512,710115,09/30/2013,4900,ACADEMIC RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTU,710115,0962916,071549000,Peggy L Fiedler,1111 Franklin Street,Oakland,US,Oakland,CA13,"University of California, Office of the President, Oakland",CA,946075200,Peggy.Fiedler@ucop.edu,Peggy,Fiedler,L,5109879850,smeacham@nsf.gov,Stephen Meacham,7032928970,040101 RRA RECOVERY ACT,"Work at the UC Natural Reserve System reserves focused on providing a faster access point at the reserve, and then using mesh network radios to provide wireless access over larger areas of the reserves. Generally new access was provided with back-haul radios on towers or buildings. Either from a single access point on the reserve, or sometimes repeater radios on large towers on the reserve, solar-powered mesh network radios provide a wireless ""cloud"" up to 1000 feet radius around each node. These mesh network radios are relatively portable and can be moved to respond to changing research needs in the future. The number of mesh network radios required to cover a reserve depends on the reserveÆs vegetation and topography (lines of sight). Open, flat reserves or those with scattered high points can get coverage with fewer radios. Very small areas of wireless access were present at the start, essentially limited to housing and office/lab facilities if they were present. Over 2500 university researchers, 3800 university students in classes, and 1700 K-12 students each year use the reserves that benefited from this grant. While there, they utilize the cyber infrastructure for research projects, teaching, and K-12 activities. 
Field stations offer the experience of ecological and research in physical sciences as well as teaching in a relatively natural, conserved ecosystem. This project will substantially improve the research and teaching experiences for those using these field stations. Access to the internet via a wireless connection has had the largest impact on the field stations. Researchers can use a wide variety of sensors that use wireless connectivity to stream data and images to labs maintained by visiting researchers. Students and teachers now have access in the field to taxonomic keys, photos, and background ecological information on the subjects they are seeing in their natural habitats. The connectivity has allowed streaming of images and sounds in real time to the general public, often bringing the natural world into classrooms, airports and homes. Residents, reserve administrators and research labs at the field stations, often in relatively remote sites, now have the good access to the University libraries, email and other web services.
This improvement in infrastructure allows researchers to have far better streaming data for the large research projects. At the Angelo Reserve, the new Eel River Critical Zone Observatory is streaming data from a complex array of sensors tracking water as it falls, penetrates the soil and moves to the rocky substrate below and into the nearby river. An array of sensors at the Blue Oak Ranch is streaming similar hydrology data to Sally ThomsonÆs lab at UC Berkeley. Astronomers at the Lick Observatory (Blue Oak Reserve) and the LCGOT Observatory are sharing the installed connection to stream data from several telescopes. The Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Lab (SNARL) was selected as the core aquatic site and STREON experimental site for domain 17 of the NSF-funded NEON project, and it will require the robust internet connection. There is substantial research at SNARL on wild vertebrates.
Examples of how the field stations use the new infrastructure to connect people with nature abound. Media and communications allow online publication of websites for the field stations, including bulletins and newsletters using Constant Contact online marketing tools (Sedgwick). The Wired Wilderness project at the Blue Oak Ranch is streaming real-time web cameras of life in and around a pond to the San Jose Airport (baggage claim area). Time-lapse sequences showing climate are also being streamed to the airport. Data from 19 new high-quality weather stations on the reserves are being streamed to researchers, the local communities around the reserves, and the general public through the Desert Research Institute (Western Regional Climate Center). Trail cameras and web cameras are streaming li...",,"['Barringer, B. C., W. D. Koenig, and J. M. H.

Project Title	INTEROP. ECO-OP: Employing Cyber Infrastructure Data Technologies to Facilitate IEA for Climate Impacts in NE & CA LME's (#3 & #7)

The purpose of this INTEROP proposal is to facilitate the deployment of an Integrated Ecosystem Approach (IEA) to management in the Northeast and California Current Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs).  The direct result of the proposed activity will be application-level data and information enhanced communication for developing the consensus networks to define the specific components of interest to support the implementation of NOAA?s Driver-Pressure-State-Impact Response framework (DPSIR) decision framework and the cyberinfrastructure technologies to ensure data interoperability and reuse. This new capability will serve as the essential foundation for the formal synthesis and quantitative analysis of information on relevant natural and socio?economic factors in relation to specified ecosystem management goals which can be applied in other LMEs.

The scope of the network includes key stakeholders in four areas: scientists and data providers, agencies, national communities of practice, and decision makers/ policy developers. The network will undertake major activities at the core team working level; technical sessions and focused workshops within each of the stakeholder areas as well as across and among the areas. Integrative activities, aligned with existing NSF-funded interoperability focused projects, community conferences and meetings will provide dissemination and broad engagement opportunities. Also key to the network activities is semantically rich use case development using expertise in semantic web methodologies, especially related to diverse vocabulary needs across the stakeholder areas.

Explicit in this project is the very broad dissemination of results; the diverse major stakeholders include decision and policy makers both at the agency and government levels as well as agency scientists and managers. The developed semantics based on leveraging existing standard vocabularies is likely to have very broad interest and use and enable extended interoperability across many disciplines. The very nature of open (semantically-enabled) data frameworks is that they receive substantial unintended use with the potential to provide substantial infrastructure improvements for research and education.

The potential benefits to society at large in terms of providing a routine and sustainable IEA that is linked to decisions and policy along with the feedbacks to the underlying monitoring and data collection cannot be under estimated. This project provides a pilot toward a robust and sustainable implementation for new national agendas such as those contained in the U.S. National Ocean Policy (July 2010).",NSF,4900,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,110 8TH ST,Troy,US,Troy,NY20,Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,NY,121803522,47.070,"['Andrew R Maffei', 'Stace E Beaulieu']",08/30/2010,002430742,1089000,08/31/2014,4900,DATA INTEROPERABILITY NETWORKS,1089000,0955649,002430742,Peter  Fox,110 8TH ST,Troy,US,Troy,NY20,Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,NY,121803522,foxp@rpi.edu,Peter,Fox,,5182764862,rchadduc@nsf.gov,Robert Chadduck,7032928970,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"ECO-OP

1. Project outcomes

In order to understand and compare the relative impacts of fishing efforts, climate change, and natural cycles on marine ecosystems, many different types of data must be collected, integrated, and interpreted. Data collected for an integrated marine assessment (IEA) may be as diverse as satellite-derived sea surface temperature, counts of zooplankton species from net tows, and landings data from commercial fisheries. To make sense of such a plethora of data, it is common practice to choose a select subset of ""indicators"" of environmental or ecosystem status that can be monitored for trends or changes over time and space. Indicators tend to be derived datasets and ""synthesized products"" (borrowing a term from NOAA Information Quality Guidelines), often the result of complex data processing workflows that integrate not only data and models but also subjective choices made by scientists based on knowledge in their domain. Interpretations of indicators, made by natural and social scientists, then are shared in reports and online to other scientists, managers and policy makers, and to the public.  An ultimate goal of the INTEROP ECO-OP project was to support the implementation of a Driver-Pressure-State-Impact Response (DPSIR) decision framework and the cyberinfrastructure technologies to ensure data interoperability and reuse.

The INTEROP ECO-OP project addressed several aspects of the technical and social challenges involved in compiling, interpreting, and reporting an IEA. To develop cyberinfrastructure for IEAs in a tight collaboration between academic and government scientists and software developers, we utilized RensselaerÆs Tetherless World Constellation (TWC) Semantic Web Methodology, in which a ""use case"" defines the interactions between the people, the software, and the desired data products. Use cases are used to scope the challenges, adopt technologies, and evaluate software prototypes. We initiated use cases for IEAs for large marine ecosystems on the Pacific (California Current) and Atlantic (Northeast U.S. Shelf) coasts, and ultimately focused on two use cases in a partnership between Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and the Ecosystem Assessment Program at NOAAÆs Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC).

One of our focus use cases was to efficiently generate figures and tables representing ecosystem data and information products for the bi-annual NEFSC Ecosystem Status Report (ESR). We iterated through the TWC Methodology three times, involving two evaluations of the software developed. Ultimately, our software reproduced the figures for a number of climate and environmental indicators and went so far as to reproduce the Climate Forcing chapter of the ESR, a prototype for the remaining chapters of the ESR. We also explored additional challenges presented by some of the ecosystem and fisheries indicators and offered training sessions to improve workflows. 

Our second use case focused on the provenance, or lineage, of the derived data products. Our goal was to provide standardized metadata for data products, so that a human (and, ultimately, in the future, a machine) could trace back to the source observational data and models used to compile an indicator. We chose to examine the W3C PROV Data Model, approved in 2013, and adopted the PROV-O ontology in our ECO-OP ontology. The ontology engineering included some classes specific to the technologies chosen in the ECO-OP project (e.g., the use of IPython Notebooks for data processing and visualization) but also some general principles which helped shape the ontology for the Global Change Information System (GCIS) for the U.S. National Climate Assessment. Our ontology work includes best practices for semantic provenance for indicators in marine ecosystem assessments. The developed semantics leverages existing standard vocabularies and will have very broad interest and use and enable extended interope...",,,09/01/2010,INTEROP ECO-OP: Employing Cyber Infrastructure Data Technologies to Facilitate IEA for Climate Impacts in NE & CA LME's (#3 & #7),Grant

More specialists are needed to prevent and investigate threats to the national cyber infrastructure such as theft of data, disabling of networks, and communications disruptions. The project objectives are: to develop a model on ground and online curriculum; to implement a replicable strategy to create awareness of cybersecurity careers among elementary and secondary school teachers, guidance counselors, students, and parents; to shape articulation agreements and other transfer models with universities (especially CAE/IAE institutions); and to create a learning model that helps military veterans earn AAS degrees in DF/IA and advance into technician-level careers and/or further education at universities.",NSF,4900,DALLAS COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT,12800 Abrams Road,Dallas,US,Dallas,TX32,Dallas County Community College Dist Richland College,TX,752432199,47.076,,08/31/2013,120774252,510894,08/31/2016,4900,ADVANCED TECH EDUCATION PROG,510894,1304004,066376278,Martha A Hogan,12800 Abrams Road,Dallas,US,Dallas,TX32,Richland College,TX,752432199,mhogan@dcccd.edu,Martha,Hogan,A,9722386211,saugust@nsf.gov,Stephanie August,7032925128,040106 NSF Education & Human Resource,"Richland College was able to expand its digital forensics online offerings. The course material was adopted and successfully deployed via the grant funded NDG Netlab+ infrastructure. Equipment purchased by the grant has reduced the student cost for laboratory expenses. It has also allowed for portability of cyber security and digital forensics lab experiences. AccessData and FTK software tools are now available for use to registered students outside of the physical classroom.

With these tools we have been able to serve veterans who may need or choose to take courses via distance learning rather than attending class for digital forensics The Associate of Applied Science degree allows students to go immediately to work. For those wishing to continue their education, established articulation agreements with multiple colleges and universities enable students to transfer their degree or credits to pursue a Bachelor degree. Veterans are currently enrolled in the program and actively pursuing their Associate degree.

During Cyber Security Awareness Month, Richland College hosts a Forum on campus. The Forum includes government and industry recognized professional speakers. Outstanding students are also invited to present their research projects at the forum. Richland faculty and students are invited along with area high school students and their teachers. This gives students the opportunity to learn of the careers in both the government and private sector directly from those working in the profession. Faculty also visit core curriculum classes on campus to inform both dual credit and college students of the possible careers and opportunities available in Digital Forensics and Cyber Security.

In this rapidly changing field the grant has allowed faculty to attend multiple conferences building a national network of both industry and academic professionals.This network is essential for a successful program to continuously collaborate to keep curriculum relevant to prepare students for employment.

160,"The Complex Systems Research Center (CSRC) at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) is creating a cyber-enabled center of learning for Earth System Science (ESS). The project builds on many years of research in global biogeochemical cycles and extending the research for geospatial teaching and community engagement. The project is developing the central map-based CIDER portal by joining together existing data systems with new Web2.0 technologies to examine the effectiveness of cyber-based learning environments (Wikis, VoiceThread, Camtasia, Jing, Screencast, Concept Mapping) and handheld mobile applications as scientific research tools for teaching ESS concepts in classrooms. The project will engage undergraduate technology students in the portal design and development process. These CI resources will be used by a Working Group of middle and high school teachers who will develop and carry out field-based pilot projects with their students in collaboration with a CSRC researcher who is studying conditions such as phenology (the study of biological phenomena interacting with climate), forest cover, and understory that promote the occurrence of Lyme disease in the Northeast. Pilot projects will involve taking repeat digital photographs of the landscape based on their Digital Earth Watch and Picture Post protocols, and collecting and analyzing data and satellite imagery. The primary learning goals are to help students connect their understanding of technology as social media to its function as a research tool; understand the role that future technologies and applications will play in Earth System Sciences; understand the relationship between scientific data and visual images; and that data collected by a network of participants at many different locations can be used to understand the ""big picture"".
The project's focus is on capturing digital technologies as a means of helping people connect with and learn about their environment. Although the center  is enabled by cyberinfrastructure, the center activities are aimed at getting young people outdoors to use handheld devices as scientific research tools for monitoring the natural environment around them, and to provide opportunities for student-scientist partnerships and service-learning, ultimately leading to an informed citizenry empowered through their experience to become local experts and community leaders.

Intellectual Merit: The CIDER learning center is an outgrowth of the PI's experiences in teacher professional development, creating and maintaining a robust cyberinfrastructure within the mission of a research university to both teach and support research, and in extending otheir research to the community-at-large. CIDER will provide a dynamic learning environment in which a wide range of learners can pursue their own interests by accessing resources such as data and visualizations from a controlled source. The project addresses the affective aspects of cyberlearning using technology to increase participant access to, and comfort with, science, to make communication between and among participants and program staff more fluid, and to expand participant understanding of how contemporary science is conducted. Results from the demonstration project will help position the CIDER learning center as a bridge between technology, place-based education, service learning, and scientific research. 

Broader Impacts 
Engaging students in the CIDER learning center brings scientists, students, educators and professionals into a partnership that they likely would not participate in otherwise. CIDER will expand the workforce potential in geospatial technologies by engaging students in technologically enabled monitoring of local environmental conditions, and connecting their knowledge to an understanding of regional and global change. Job sectors that depend on geospatial data include urban planning, natural resource management, transportation, agriculture, health and energy. Results of the pilot projects will be disseminated at regional and national science teacher association meetings and science professional societies and CIDER will become a part of a larger UNH teacher professional development program within the new UNH Center for Excellence in Geosciences Education.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF NEW HAMPSHIRE,51 COLLEGE RD SERVICE BLDG 107,Durham,US,Durham,NH01,University of New Hampshire,NH,038243585,47.070,"['Jeffrey S Beaudry', 'Michael  Palace']",08/01/2011,111089470,249974,09/30/2014,4900,CI-TEAM,249974,1135545,001765866,Annette L Schloss,,,US,Durham,NH01,University of New Hampshire,NH,038242600,annette.schloss@unh.edu,Annette,Schloss,L,6038621792,achtchel@nsf.gov,Almadena Y. Chtchelkanova,7032928910,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Access to hand-held mobile devices and WiFi will be transformative for education in outdoor settings. CIDER advanced the definition of cyberlearning in both the formal and informal STEM education community by integrating handheld technologies and WiFi access with more traditional field-based science experiences. This creates a new mixed reality environment in which learners are able to interact simultaneously with the tangible reality of making place-based observations at their study site while also calling up relevant data, viewing past observations made by others, and interacting in real-time with scientists and other experts. The project showed that the digital camera works very well as a conceptual framework for science learning in outdoor settings, and that Picture Posts &ndash; the 8-sided platforms for taking repeat digital photographs of the landscape, are an easy-to-use and valuable standardized method for collecting and sharing data. Taken together, CIDER resources provide a learning environment in which a wide range of learners can pursue their own interests &ndash; whether in the school yard, their local park, a community natural area, or their own backyard, and at the same time make important contributions to a national archive of repeat digital photographs through the Picture Post Network (http://picturepost.unh.edu). 

The CIDER learning center concept brought together scientists, students, educators and professionals into partnerships that they likely would not participate in otherwise, thereby creating new opportunities for participation in technology development, research and community action. Students had firsthand access to scientists and in carrying out science-based projects, offering them an inside view of a research career. Teachers leveraged their CIDER participation to improve technology at their schools, from installing outdoor WiFi to obtaining iPads for their students to winning an Unsung Hero Award for a class project. Undergraduate students benefited from having real-world experience creating and publishing useful mobile applications, and in developing a business model and a cost-effective manufacturing process for Picture Post platforms. In addition to contributing to the growing Picture Post Network, projects that began in the classroom are now providing data to other citizen science networks including the NH Lotic Volunteer (LoVoTECS) Network and the Community Collaborative Rain, Hail, and Snow Network (CoCoRaHS-Albedo). Exposing students to projects that connect local conditions that they are monitoring with regional and global change and with partnerships that work to solve environmental issues with the aid of technology serves to develop engaged citizens who are equipped to make informed decisions about important societal issues. These opportunities also serve to expand the workforce in geospatial technologies in job sectors that depend on critical thinking, problem solving, quantitative skills, and geospatial and temporal data including urban planning, forest and other natural resource management, ecosystem services, transportation, agriculture, the health industry and energy, among many others.

161,"Modern malware is used extensively in computer crime and cyber-warfare
and poses a serious threat to the cyber-infrastructure of the United
States, at the military, civil, and corporate levels.  Malware can
employ a number of techniques to gain access to needed resources and
to prevent detection, including hooking or modifying system calls,
adding new system calls, inserting new kernel modules, and directly
patching kernel code.  Furthermore, malware is increasingly stealthy,
being both difficult to detect and to analyze, and current-generation
schemes for detection, analysis, and mitigation will become
increasingly ineffective as the trend toward additional stealth
increases, with more esoteric infection vectors, complex packing
schemes, polymorphism, and metamorphism being employed.

This proposal leverages emerging live digital forensics techniques, to
create powerful techniques for malware detection and mitigation. These
live forensics techniques deeply analyze memory dumps and build
accurate models of kernel and application structures that reflect the
state of the machine at the time of an investigation.  By integrating
live forensics techniques into a virtual machine monitor (VMM) and
developing hardware-supported introspection techniques to analyze
system state, malware detection facilities can be created that prevent
malware from interfering with detection and mitigation strategies.
The proposal discusses a number of necessary tasks to support this
research agenda, including the design of and development of a
hardware-assisted VMM introspection architecture and deep, portable
modeling of kernel data structures and other guest VM state, including
the filesystem.  These modeling techniques can then be used for
real-time verification of critical kernel code, cross-verification of
kernel structures, application state analysis, and protection of
critical system files. A novel aspect of the proposed research is the
use of commodity Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), protected by
hardware directed-I/O virtualization, as malware detection
accelerators.

The intellectual merit of the proposed research is to increase the
depth, flexibility, and capabilities of introspected live forensics
analysis and to expand the scope of live forensics to the detection of
sophisticated malware.  The proposed techniques expand
state-of-the-art in live forensics techniques, virtual machine
introspection, and kernel-level malware detection and will provide a
foundation on which to build even more powerful techniques.  The
broader impacts of the proposed work touch all sectors of society,
since individual citizens, as well as the law enforcement, military,
and corporate communities all benefit from the deployment of more
sophisticated malware detection mechanisms. The proposed work also
enhances the existing curriculum in information assurance at the
University of New Orleans, since research results from this effort
will be incorporated into both undergraduate and graduate courses,
exposing students to an important area of study in which the supply of
practitioners falls far short of the demand.

Greenspan,7032928910,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Modern malware is used extensively in computer crime and cyber-warfare and poses a serious threat to the cyber-infrastructure of the United States, at all levels, including military, civil, and corporate.  The goals of malware authors are to create enduring denial of service attacks, to gain access to private information, and to gain and maintain unauthorized access to computer systems, among other things. Unlike early malware threats, malware development is now monetized and the resulting malware is both stealthy and weaponized, employing a number of techniques to prevent detection. Unfortunately, classical anti-malware techniques, based on simple pattern matching (essentially, trying to match sequences of bytes in the malware's code) and behavioral models (e.g., does it act like malware?) are woefully inadequate to deal with the threats associated with current-generation malware.


The goals of this NSF project were to target a specific type of computing environment, e.g., large scale virtualized environments (including but not limited to ""the cloud"") and to leverage new memory forensics techniques and VM introspection (which allows a trusted agent to ""peek inside"" a VM) to detect and mitigate malware in this type of environment.  Specifically, our intention was to develop more powerful introspection techniques, which allowed deep analysis of the states of a collection of virtual machines, and to create new ways of modeling, analyzing, and cross-verifying the states of the operating system kernels and important applications, to detect malicious behavior.  Malicious behavior, for our purposes, included attacks like heap-spraying and tampering with important operating system kernel structures.  During the project, we developed a number of promising techniques, verified their effectiveness, and published the results. One additional beneficial outcome of the project was that a post-doc hired to develop some of the techniques and co-supervise graduate students involved in the research, was subsequently identified as a very promising new researcher, and hired as a tenure-track faculty member by the university.

162,"In today?s digital age almost all aspects of both federal and commercial day-to-day operations are cyber-based. This heavy reliance on cyber-infrastructure requires security, as without security modern networks are susceptible to both internal and external attacks. This project will result in the advancement of our state of knowledge and our understanding of a number of fundamental cryptographic tasks needed for securing cyber-infrastructure. The efficiency of cryptographic tasks is typically measured in terms of computational load, communication bandwidth needed, and the number of rounds of interaction required. 

The goals for this research include a study of public key encryption schemes that allow one to encrypt functions of private keys.  Another goal is to embark on a broad study of public key encryption schemes with additional algebraic properties that allow combining cyphertexts (without knowing the decryption). Yet another goal of this research effort is to study new techniques for speeding up the computation involved in performing cryptographic tasks. 

This effort will sponsor new students to join the research program, and it will exercise outreach efforts through education?including education for minority student and security professionals and consultants.

 ""An In-Depth Study of Homomorphic Encryption in Cryptography"" 
PIÆs: Rafail Ostrovsky, Amit Sahai
This project covered a number of research topics spanning cryptography, with an overall focus on developing and studying cryptographic protocols.  Over the course of this grant, more than 10 current and former Ph.D. students,  5 postdoctoral fellows, and 6 outside researchers contributed to this research.  This research contributed to the publication of more than 40 original research publications.  Here, we highlight just one contribution in the key area of research that of zero-knowledge proofs with additional security properties. Zero-Knowledge proofs is a fascinating and counter-intuitive notion: In a zero-knowledge proof, one entity, called the Prover, tries to convince another entity, called the Verifier, that some statement is true.  If the statement really is true, then the Prover will succeed in convincing the Verifier.  However, if the statement is false, the Prover should not be able to convince the Verifier to accept his proof.  Finally, the most crucial and counter-intuitive property of zero-knowledge proofs is that even if the Prover succeeds in convincing the Verifier that the statement is true, the Verifier should not learn anything about why the statement is true.  For applications to cryptography, the kind of statements that a Prover wants to prove concern secrets &ndash; and what makes zero-knowledge proofs so useful is that they allow a Prover to prove facts about his secrets without revealing them.  Before our research under this grant, zero-knowledge proofs that a Prover could write down in a file would have allowed future advances in computing to eventually recover the secret from the written proof. In work published in the Journal of the ACM in 2012, the PIs, working with their former postdoctoral student Jens Groth, presented a detailed solution of constructing the first perfect zero-knowledge proofs that could be written once and for all, never revealing their secrets.  This settled a question that had been open for 18 years at the time the PIs first devised their solution and lay the groundwork for the construction of ``lossy encryptionÆÆ that proved a key building block for multiple follow-up discoveries. The mathematics of elliptic curves played a crucial role in our new technique for constructing zero-knowledge proofs.

164,"Continued progress in materials science and engineering has become increasingly dependent upon global collaborative efforts that pool resources and reduce costs through a Materials World Network operating in real and virtual space. This project supports the design and development of a prototype International Virtual Institute (IVI) as a test bed for the virtual services envisioned for a Materials World Network. The project develops a cyber-infrastructure that will enhance the use of physical infrastructures in real space.  The proposed IVI prototype includes, in the first phase, a Global Research Gallery and an Evaluation Center. The Global Research Gallery will allow researchers and students to: 1. View pre-publication results on current research; 2. Discuss research findings without attending a conference; 3. Compare research results from different labs at one location; find the latest research techniques and identify tools for cutting edge measurements; 4. Develop potential collaborators with complementary research strengths and resources; 5. View previously inaccessible research activities from top-rated institutions; 6. Present their research work at minimal cost; and 7. Create global topical networks. 8. Schedule special GRG exhibits to meet their specific research and networking needs. The Evaluation Center will be used to assess the usefulness of our cyber infrastructure. User feedback will be collected to evaluate the following: 1. Global use of the IVI as a resource for research and collaboration; 2. Willingness of users to participate in the further development of the IVI network; and 3. General level of support from academia, industry, government, foundations, etc. More specifically, a multiple-focus approach will be adopted to evaluate benefits to the community.

The proposed project can potentially enrich the research and education environment of students, teachers and their colleagues. In particular, the IVI prototype can deliver the most impact in the following
areas: 1. It can enhance the utilization and the sharing of global infrastructures for research and
education; 2. The IVI infrastructure is designed to facilitate the rapid and broad dissemination of
scientific and technological findings and understanding; 3. Provides a unique opportunity to enhance
teaching, training and learning among students and teachers from different parts of the world; 4. It is a
uniquely useful platform for encouraging global scientific and cultural exchanges among students; and

Due to this project?s activities, the university realized increased communication, collaboration, and engagement between the researchers and the technologists on campus, the relationships that were built between the two sides are as valuable as the improvements in the technical infrastructure. The upgraded network provided an efficient, reliable and usable infrastructure for conducting science and engineering research. Additionally, IT network engineering team changed its perspective when examining network design, which now includes research activities and factionless transfer at a higher priority than prior to this project. The IT network engineers, staff and leadership team have developed a better understanding of the researchers needs and requirements which drove the new design of the network which was deployed as ""ScienceDMZ"" or ""MUScienceNet"". Further, the IT network team built PerfSonar boxes and distributed them at specifically identified locations on the ScienceDMZ to collect network performance measurements from end to end, and allowed comparing pre-project with post-project testing results. The testing results what showed multi-fold increases in transfer speed also helped in identified any bottlenecks on the network and to other institutions which led to removing obstacles and optimize the network. The improved speed is encouraging additional use of the network to transfer data from the researchers to Marshall Data center and from Marshall network to other institutions (e.g. WVU, XSEDE and Internet2 members), which will facilitate and accelerate the research process. Furthermore, the optimized network for research is inciting other researchers in different disciplines to utilize the ScienceDMZ and leverage the faster network in their research and collaboration(s) with other institutions. The involvement on the IT department staff in this project also increased the knowledge around network optimization and segmentation and it improved collaboration between researchers and technologists in the IT department. The community outreach activities increased awareness of the cyberinfrastructure resources available on campus for researchers and faculty to leverage in their projects. It also offered a forum for discussing potential scientific research projects that require high bandwidth and large storage and transfer rates. The project ultimately broadened the access to high-end computing facilities and resources to Marshall University?s emerging research activities.

Title: MRI/Acq.: Big-Data Private Cloud Research Cyberinfrastructure (BDPC)            
Project Proposed:
This project, acquiring a novel cyber-infrastructure instrument for big data cloud computing designed as a loosely coupled computations system with large memory requirements, enables a significant range of application domains as well as research into infrastructures for cloud computing. The domain sciences addressed range from development of big-data enabling software technologies spanning fundamental computer science work, to the analysis of electronic medical records, twitter streams, and hurricane evacuation strategies. Additional benefits are expected in understanding disease and therapeutic treatments, and in the development and application of mathematical models in the areas of machine learning, optimization, compressed sensing, image processing, and statistical analysis and data mining. The instrument will also help bridge the gap between numerical models and observations in astrophysics.
Broader Impacts:  
The broader impacts on society, and especially in education and training (including for members of underrepresented groups) are all compelling. The instrument will directly impact the educational experience for all students taking classes in computing and computational problem solving. The targeted research communities are diverse and broad, including the underrepresented groups, with strong empirical and experimental components. The proposed instrument is highly suitable for training and education.",NSF,4900,WILLIAM MARSH RICE UNIVERSITY,6100 MAIN ST,Houston,US,Houston,TX02,William Marsh Rice University,TX,770051827,47.070,"['Lydia  Kavraki', 'Ashok  Veeraraghavan', 'Genevera  Allen', 'Stephen  Bradshaw']",08/30/2013,050299031,400000,09/30/2016,4900,MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION,400000,1338099,050299031,Moshe Y Vardi,6100 Main St,Houston,US,Houston,TX02,William Marsh Rice University,TX,770051827,vardi@rice.edu,Moshe,Vardi,Y,7133485977,rrodrigu@nsf.gov,Rita V. Rodriguez,7032925188,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Today, computation is a cornerstone of scientific inquiry, as important to science and engineering as the traditional approaches of theory and experimentation. To support computational research and scholarship across science and engineering, we procured, deployed and are now operating a high-throughput computing resource at Rice. This newly deployed system replaced old inefficient, end-of-life infrastructure with limited capabilities which rendered it too costly to operate for what it delivered and inadequate for supporting the forward looking federally funded research and development by researchers at Rice University and their collaborators.

 The deployed system, co-funded by Rice University, consists of a total of 88 dual-socket HPE Linux-based server nodes interconnected with a 10gb/s network. The system is supported by a 220 TeraByte (TB) Lustre scratch file system and a 50 TB NFS file system for longer term data storage. Rice plans to operate this resource for 5 years (60 months).

 After 18 months in full production, the system has delivered over 12 million core hours supporting the computationally demanding research of fifty faculty members and their associated three hundred plus users. The user community is continuing to grow and we expect, based on past experience, that within the next 6-12 months the number of faculty members and users supported will likely double. Faculty members supporting users on the system today are developing computational techniques to advance science and engineering with direct impact on many disciplines, including astrophysics, computer-aided verification, machine vision, robotics, and statistical machine learning. The system has already enabled significant student training, not only though serving as a platform for accelerating research and discovery, but by serving as a resource used in seven classes across engineering (reaching over 250 students). While usage by classes is very small as a percentage of total time, it is a critical part of preparing students for careers that are increasingly dependent on computing skills.

 While national supercomputing resources, such as XSEDE, can provide the research community with substantial computing capabilities, the investigators needed a local modest-size resource that would complement XSEDE in order to facilitate development, small scale experimentation, training and support the long tail of research computing. In particular, the higher bandwidth and lower latency to the desktop from a local system better supports both code development and interactive data analysis using tools with graphical user interfaces.

 This system has enabled Rice to successfully deploy and operate an on-premises computational infrastructure in support of expanding demand for throughput computing to facilitate rapidly growing simulation, modeling, big-data data, and analytics computational experiments. Massive throughput computing is a type of computational workload that is generally too large to be efficiently executed on an individual workstation but too small to be competitive or well suited for running on an XSEDE resource. This class of computing needs is currently ideally served by the on-premises infrastructure such as the infrastructure procured and deployed under this award.

167,"This award supports the operations of the Social Observatories Coordinating Network (SOCN), a research coordination network that will work with a broad cross-section of scholars in the social, behavioral, and economic (SBE) scientific communities in the development and planning of a set of observatories that will transform SBE science.  The major objectives of the network are to continue exploration of ideas regarding the potential form and functioning of a network of social observatories and to actively engage individuals and groups across the SBE research community in this process.  SOCN will work with disciplinary and interdisciplinary groups to ensure that they contribute to the design of these proposed observatories and that the scientific questions the observatories might pursue will have value for basic research and for a broad range of practical uses.  SOCN will widely dissemination reports and other findings, and it will facilitate interactions among scholars, particularly at national professional meetings and other scientific conferences.

The network will facilitate the consideration and development of what is expected to be a transformative set of observatories that would provide a new platform for data collection, data archiving, and data distribution; advanced cyberinfrastructure for a truly interdisciplinary SBE scientific enterprise; new approaches to training of students; and a focal point for synthesis and faculty collaboration around questions of national importance.  A coordinated suite of social observatories is expected to add new capabilities for SBE sciences by moving to fine-grained and place-based studies that address local, regional, and national concerns.  The observatories will advance understanding of individual decision making via experiments, ethnography, spatially explicit data, administrative, and social media data that, when combined over all sites, will be nationally representative.

The major objectives of the Social Observatories Coordinating Network (SOCN) were to explore ideas regarding the potential form and functioning of a new form of infrastructure for research - a network of regional data centers - and to actively engage individuals and groups across the social, behavioral, and economic research community in this process.

 

Outcomes

There are four major take-away messages gained from this project:

Behavior is so situation-      and place-specific that it is practically impossible to use widely      dispersed national samples of populations to draw conclusions about      processes in any one place.  Populations      tend to be clustered spatially by social, economic, and demographic characteristics.  This has implications for important      issues of national concern, such as adaptation to environmental change and      social mobility.  Social policy,      economic conditions, race/ethnic/immigrant composition, and the size of      the middle class in a city provide a context in which individuals can      thrive or stagnate, leading to important questions about the roles of      government, nonprofits, and for-profit organizations in fostering      opportunity and mobility processes, and the impact of their policies on      individuals, families, and neighborhoods. 
The network considered a      new national framework or platform that is both scalable and flexible for      addressing these new challenges, one that allows for rapid response to      local crises such as the devastating impact of tornadoes and hurricanes or      social unrest, and those provoked by prolonged regional drought or      economic decline. This platform can also address national crises such as      the declining middle class and why in many schools across the country our      children are not learning optimally.
In consultation with      statistical experts  and based upon      earlier workshops on cyber-infrastructure, our network proposed the      development of twenty to twenty-five regional data centers located across      the United States. Each center would collect, organize, create, and      disseminate data. These regional data centers or ""social observatories""      would follow about 400 census tracts over time and space from twenty to      twenty-five regions across the country. Working closely with local and      state governments, they would access administrative data with information      on not just a sample of the population of those several hundred census      tracts, but complete records on all the population in those tracts (i.e.,      circa two million Americans). The centers would serve as data collection      facilities wherein data are cleaned, linked, and made available for      legitimate research purposes through a secure integrated data      dissemination system. Although they would be charged with keeping data on      their particular geographic region, some of these centers may have a      national focus as well. These centers may conduct surveys but they would      also use data sources that until now have not been part of the toolbox of      the social sciences, and they would connect these data to local context      and place without losing the capacity to aggregate and serve as a national      sample of people and places in the United States. Our vision is that,      collectively, they would offer a nationally representative sample, one      that was highly clustered so as to capture local context and variability.
Linking diverse forms of      data, including administrative and social media data, represents the most      efficient way to obtain more place-specific information in our current social      science data bases.  This is the      focus of our edited volume (669) of the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, January      2017.  Probably the most important,      least well-addressed, and most difficult issue raised was privacy and confidentiality      in the handling of individual data.       This is an area recommended for future NSF initiatives.  


 

Broader Impacts

The observatory network explicitly responded to what is now a broad call in many scientific circles to address issues of importance with the best tools available without regard for disciplinary origins. We expect this project to have broad impact on thinking regarding research and data collection in multiple fields of scientific inquiry.  The proposed new scientific infrastructure will enable the social, behavioral, and economic sciences (SBE) to contribute to societal needs at multiple levels and will facilitate collaboration with other sciences in addressing questions of critical importance. The proposed data centers could transform how the SBE sciences go about their work for decades to come by encouraging integration and linkage across varied forms of data by scientists from multiple disciplines representing all regions of the country.

Proposal Title:	United States Virgin Islands EPSCoR RII Program: Intercampus and Intra-campus Connectivity

Institution:			University of The Virgin Islands (UVI)

This Research Infrastructure Improvement project seeks to build on the Territory?s investments in cyberinfrastructure by providing the broadband connectivity needed to accelerate discovery and learning at the University of The Virgin Islands (UVI), an Historically Black University. This connectivity will allow UVI?s faculty and staff to be more fully integrated into nationwide interdisciplinary research collaborations though access to Internet2 and the National Lambda Rail (NLR).  Through proposed curricular expansions, enhanced graduate research experiences, and high-performance computing training, UVI?s students will be better positioned for graduate school and life-long careers in marine science, mathematics, and computer science.


Intellectual Merit 
By providing a high-bandwidth network interconnection from the St. Croix submarine landing station to UVI?s St. Croix campus, this project will connect UVI researchers, collaborators, and mentors across the Territory to each other and to others across the nation. The project aims to connect the St. Croix campus to the AMPATH International Exchange Point which would provide access to networks such as Internet2 and National Lambda Rail (NLR).  The enhanced cyber-infrastructure environment will support collaborative research projects underway at UVI in the broad area of marine science.  Specifically, these projects focus on determination of factors that enhance or reduce a coral reef?s tolerance to environmental stress and resistance to transitions to alternate ecological states (ecological resilience). These projects also include robust field experiments, utilizing sophisticated environmental analysis techniques and developing high-resolution oceanographic models, to increase the understanding of how ecological patterns and processes are influenced by natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Understanding these complex relationships is of paramount importance to managing them, especially considering that over the last three to five years the corals within the USVI experienced 30% to 40% mortality due to climate-induced stress (i.e. warm-water bleaching) and disease. The proposed infrastructure enhancements will ensure that research and educational activities have the collaborative bandwidth support needed for a reliable research and engineering network connection to key national and international collaborators.

Broader Impacts
Through UVI?s improved connection to AMPATH via the new fiber, underrepresented undergraduate students will have access to enhanced research and educational opportunities, which will better prepare them for success in graduate school and result in improvements in the Territory?s workforce. The project team aims to leverage the VI-EPSCoR marine science program at the University?s Center of Excellence in Marine and Environmental Studies called the Integrated Caribbean Coastal Ecosystems to develop scientific and technical services to support local decision-makers in natural resources management and spatial planning. The project will support training in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines for students, who are underrepresented minorities and women, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. The enhancements in this project will ensure continued broadband access and competitive options for the Territory. Data and results from studies conducted on the islands will be made far more accessible to distant collaborators and dissemination to stakeholders will be significantly improved.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS,#2 John Brewers Bay,Charlotte Amalie,US,St Thomas,VI00,University of The Virgin Islands,VI,008026004,47.083,['Tina  Koopmans'],08/30/2011,090003765,1000000,01/31/2015,4900,EPSCoR Research Infrastructure,1000000,1108076,090003765,Henry H Smith,#2 John Brewers Bay,Charlotte Amalie,US,St Thomas,VI00,University of The Virgin Islands,VI,008026004,hsmith@uvi.edu,Henry,Smith,H,3406931062,skennan@nsf.gov,"Kennan, Sean C.",7032927575,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The University of the Virgin Islands (UVI) boasts its own beach and its own Research and Technology Park, but one of the major distinctions of UVI is that it is located on three different islands. To get from one campus to another, travel by air or sea is required. The EPSCOR RII Program  has allowed UVI to better connect all three campuses.

UVI sought to provision and maintain 'dark fiber' infrastructure from the University's St. Croix campus to the Global Crossing/Level3 collocation facility on the west end of the island. The primary goal was to increase capacity and provide additional reliability beyond the current wide area network inter-island wireless microwave system currently in place. Partners were the Virgin Islands Next Generation Network (viNGN), fiber services provider, and the AMPATH International Exchange Point for Research and Education in Miami, operated by Florida International UniversityÆs Center for Internet Augmented Research and Assessment (FIU- CIARRA).UVI's Information Technology Services (ITS) also sought proposals for the provision and installation of underground conduit systems and fiber optic cabling on the St. Croix campus. This secondary goal provides on-campus fiber connectivity to increase network access speeds to and from existing and new buildings. Upgrading the on-campus fiber allows the UVI research community to take advantage of high-speed internet and Internet2 services, and to increase access speeds to both hosted and on-site research applications.

Implementing both goals allows the university to expand internet service and its existing network capabilities, between the St. Croix campus and UVIÆs St. Thomas and St. John campuses, as well as between existing campus buildings. This in turn allows UVI to close the cyberinfrastructure gap by providing broadband connectivity equivalent to that of major research institutions in the continental United States. These investments accelerate learning and discovery at a recognized Historical Black College and University (HBCU) that is the only university in the USVI, allowing UVI's faculty and staff to be fully integrated into nationwide interdisciplinary research collaborations through curricular enhancements, graduate research, and high-performance computing training. UVI's students are better positioned for graduate school and life-long careers in marine science and mathematics, as well as computer science fields.

Key outcomes:

Increased Bandwidth
Low Attenuation and Greater Distance
Increased Data Security
Increased Network Immunity and Reliability
Redundant Data Flow Design
Increased Standards
Decreased Maintenance Cost


UVIÆs function is to hold classes, deliver course content, and meet student, faculty and staff research needs. UVIÆs wide area network (WAN) and local area network (LAN) infrastructure have been built with the focus on delivering reliable internet services that can meet and scale with the universityÆs growing needs. UVIÆs multi-campus operations depend heavily on videoconferencing, one of several critical applications that traverse UVIÆs LAN and WAN environments.  UVI researchers depend heavily on Internet2 and WAN services to deliver large amounts of data between campuses as well as off campus to other collaborating universities.

Specific impacts are:

Increased WAN bandwidth among campuses.


UVIÆs video conferencing now has less packet loss and is more reliable between the campuses. Increased bandwidth also enables ITS to consider alternate video conferencing solutions that can seamlessly connect our traditional video conference system with users on desktop solutions (including Microsoft Lync, Cisco Jabber, Google Video Chat), standard web-browsers, and mobile devices. These video conference solutions include support for HD content and video sharing, adding collaboration capabilities to our learning environment for up to 25 participants per meeting. They also help students and faculty connect from virtually anywhere wi...",,,08/15/2011,United States Virgin Islands EPSCoR RII Program:  Intercampus and Intra-campus Connectivity,Grant

Title: 		IAD: Infr for Environmental Monitoring and Modeling using Large-Scale Sensor Networks

Project Proposed:
This project, developing a publicly available environmental monitoring computer research infrastructure, incorporates open sensor network platforms and tools with intertwined wired and wireless sensors and actuators to support computing research and education. Through the one-stop web interface, users will be able to perform over-the-air programming on the wireless sensor networks and collect, model, and visualize real-time environmental data about water, land, and air from thousands of miles away. A channel measurement toolbox will be developed to capture propagation characteristics for the field of wireless sensor networks. Extensive data, including RF signal strength and throughput, will be collected for different scenaris. The work contributes to develop the Texas Environmental Observatory (TEO) that builds upon and goes beyond the ECOPLEX (Environmental Conditions Online of DFW MetroPLEX). TEO provides a real life testbed for projects that would be impossible without the deployment of large-scale environmental monitoring sensor networks and the fine-grained spatio-temporal sensor data.

171,"The Cyber Infrastructure Training and Mentoring (CI-TraM) project serves the national interest by developing and increasing the cyberinfrastructure (CI) literacy of undergraduates who are interested in STEM careers.  It does this through technical training and career mentoring focused around building knowledge in CI.  CI-TraM provides direct mentoring of new undergraduates by active STEM researchers and IT professionals.  The training will be provided by a diverse group of researchers in CI-intensive domains and CI professionals.  Topics will include network and data security, high performance computing, computer architecture, and data analytics tools to provide the background to explore computing in a) cybersecurity, b) patterns discovery in biological data, c) computational physics, d) neuroscience, e) game design and human-computer interaction, etc.  This will help address the challenge of creating a future STEM workforce that has the technical and professional skills needed to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; or to secure the national defense.  The CI-TraM program, developed in a Hispanic Serving Institution (NMSU), cultivates untapped talent within a growing, yet underrepresented, population in STEM careers. The model used for community engagement and student recruitment addresses the transitions between secondary education, post-secondary education, and individual career planning and management.  The CI-TraM model will be designed to become institutionalized with the ability to be replicated in other communities.

The main goals of the CI-TraM program are: 1) To develop a program that exposed and retains students in CI-STEM fields while teaching them valuable technical and life skills needed for successfully pursing, attaining, and maintaining careers, and 2) To develop a program that is sustainable and scalable to other institutions so that other student populations may benefit from the program.  The program utilizes common job site internship procedures in area high schools that provide dual/concurrent college credit.  The CI-TraM program will create a cohort of students interns each academic semester and summer (50/yr) that have demonstrated interest/ability in STEM career pathways.  To achieve Goal 1, technical training and career planning modules developed and taught by working STEM researchers and IT professionals will be completed by each student intern.  At the start and finish of the program a general assessment of a student's knowledge will be performed, and each module would have a tangible deliverable to evaluate student understanding and progress throughout the program.  The program itself will be assessed by a longitudinal follow up that will track students into their futures.  Assessment results will be used by the program coordinators in a continual improvement process.  To achieve Goal 2, the modules will be generated using a standard Learning Management System allowing them to be transferable to other universities.  External consultant-created rubrics will be used to evaluate the modules and their efficacy as well as the efficacy of the modules together as the body of the CI-TraM program and available for others to use.",NSF,4900,NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY,Corner of Espina St. & Stewart,Las Cruces,US,Las Cruces,NM02,New Mexico State University,NM,880038002,47.070,"['Satyajayant  Misra', 'Abdel-Hameed  Badawy']",07/12/2017,173851965,467170,07/31/2020,4900,CyberTraining - Training-based,467170,1730653,861367373,Diana V Dugas,,,US,Las Cruces,NM02,New Mexico State University,NM,880038002,dugasdvt@nmsu.edu,Diana,Dugas,V,5756466498,sprasad@nsf.gov,Sushil Prasad,7032925059,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,,08/01/2017,CyberTraining: CDL: Cyber Infrastructure Training and Mentoring (CI-TraM),Grant

This role accelerates scientific discovery by bridging the gap between researchers, other CI professionals, and institutional leadership. This role helps researchers overcome technical barriers in areas like data acquisition, network throughput, computational analysis, software management, and the storage/retrieval of research data. To create sustainable and scalable solutions, the CI Engineer leverages two central IT divisions (Networking and Computer Systems), and also partners with faculty and graduate students within the various research projects. These partnerships increase scientific computing skills across campus. The CI Engineer role reports directly to the Chief Information Officer who has established a greater priority for CI to support research at NMSU. Additionally this new role is also uniquely positioned to give voice to research priorities within the broader University IT Governance process.

NMSU's Cyber Infrastructure Engineer role is expected to expand and improve CI solutions for faculty researchers, graduate students, and undergraduates. This includes greater access to high performance computing, open science grid computing, high throughput networks, and better data storage/retrieval systems. CI solutions both on and off campus will be used to accelerate scientific discovery.

While graph algorithms for big-memory machines abound, they are inaccessible to the wider community. Developing appropriate abstractions for graph applications on distributed cyber-infrastructure like Clouds and commodity clusters has been challenging.

The aim of this project was to investigate graph algorithms, focused on de novo plant genome sequencing, that use a scalable subgraph-centric graph programming model for Clouds to accelerate a core set of next generation sequencing graph algorithms. A graph programming abstraction for large scale distributed graph processing was proposed. Based on this abstraction, subgraph-centric algorithms to rapidly accelerate distributed graph analytics were developed and applied to the accelerated analysis of datasets acquired from various domains ranging from de novo plant genome sequencing to online social networks, and road networks.

This exploratory inter-disciplinary research has the potential to profoundly impact next-generation genome sequencing in addition to other domains where graph abstractions can be employed. Research activities into distributed graph analytics led to the following outcomes:

Massive graph data processing acceleration. A large-scale graph computing software stack that enables scalable processing of graph data is applicable not only to plant genomics but other domains as well. Our work on incremental graph processing leverages the structure of prior computations to automatically identify opportunities for computation reuse. Experiments using real-life graph datasets showed that incremental subgraph-centric processing based on our abstraction achieved substantial reduction in computation time, leading to significant speedups as opposed to snapshot-based computation.

Dense Subgraph Mining on Massive Graphs. Several applications in computation biology, including discovering correlated genes, involve finding large subgraphs of high density. In this research, we proposed the problem of finding the largest subgraph of a given density. We proposed an algorithm that finds the subgraph by running multiple local search heuristics with random restarts. Experiments performed on real-life and synthetic datasets showed that our solution always discovers the largest dense subgraph with provable density guarantees.

174,"This award supports a workshop with the goal of bringing together U.S. and Colombian researchers and graduate students to identify nanotechnology research problems related to energy and medical applications that are of mutual interest to our hemisphere. The focus areas of the workshop will be local nanomaterials, biofuels with more diverse feedstocks than the US, low-cost solar cells using local biodegradable materials, low-cost medical innovation, which will build on the US strength in fundamental nanoscience and state-of-the-art instrumentation. Potential areas of discussion are the role of nanotechnology in 4th generation biofuels production, and scanning probe methods for characterizing energetic materials. The long-term vision for this workshop is to develop a model for international cooperation that addresses three key aspects: (i) emphasizing long-term, international research opportunities for graduate students and early-career researchers; (ii) leveraging existing cyber tools to accelerate collaboration between U.S. and Colombian scientists; and (iii) identifying international funding opportunities that will promote nanotechnology research in the U.S. and Colombia. 

The workshop is scheduled to be held in October 2012 in Medellín, Colombia. Multiple Colombian federal agencies, research centers of excellence, universities and leading corporations will be partners in this effort, including: (i) Colciencias, the Colombian Department of Science, Technology and Innovation; (ii) EPM, the largest energy provider in Colombia; and (iii) the Center of Excellence in Novel Materials. This workshop will consist of oral presentations and poster sessions, panel discussions, and a tutorial on the ""nanoHUB"" tool and other cyber-infrastructure organized by Purdue's Network for Computational Nanotechnology. Strengthening graduate education and education opportunities will be a key focus of the workshop.

Progress in these areas simply cannot be achieved by any one country alone because the skills, knowledge base, resources needed to tackle these problems are truly distributed worldwide. In particular, Colombia is a U.S. ally and a net energy exporter with tremendous  resources in hydroelectricity, minerals, coal, and biofuels and at the  same time it is one of the most mega-biodiverse countries on the planet  with a strong agriculture, textile, and food sector and growing  technology base in energy, health and medicine. Colombian nanotechnology researchers have complementary expertise in many of the areas mentioned above for example in local nanomaterials, biofuels with more diverse feedstocks than the US, low-cost solar cells using local biodegradable materials, low-cost medical innovation.

The main results of the workshop were as follows:

More than 300 people registered for the workshop ensuring that the space was filled to capacity for most talks. Wide press coverage accompanied the proceedings. The workshop gained tremendous visibility from the strong advertising carried out by the University of Antioquia as well as by the presence of distinguished speakers. Given that the Colombian scientists came from many regions and more than 15 institutions this can truly be regarded as being representative of Colombian scientific community in Colombia.
The breakout sessions for the part clearly identified unique collaboration areas in nanotechnology between the US and Colombia. Specifically in the theme of nanotechnolgy education, cooperation with the US through cyber-infrastructure was strongly encouraged. The sessions identified cooperation in research infrastructure also as a possible point of cooperation with the US. In the theme of nanotechnology in medicine the team identified joint research in tropical diseases such as Chagas  Disease &amp; Brain diseases: Alzheimer, for instance as one possible  point of collaboration with the US. A good topic of future work would be nanomedicine based on Colombian Biodiversity. Nanotechnology in clean water and water treatment was also identified as a key area of mutual interest and strengths.
Many follow-up research visits have already occurred or are planned between the US and Colombian participants.


One key outcome of the panel was the commitment from several key stakeholders towards the development of the Colombian National Nanotechnology Center in Medellin. The company EPM has already purchased a plot of land for the purpose and preliminary building designs have been made. The workshop precipitated commitment from many partners for the funding model of the proposed center. This financing will now be divided between EPM, the city and state government and the local Universities in Medellin. If successful this center could be built in 2015 and would greatly help ongoing cooperation with the US.

 

Finally  there was broad consensus that this be made an annual workshop (US-Colombia) for the next few years. The next such continuation workshop will be held in 2015 at the Universidad de los Andes in Bogota.

175,"Integration of Grid Enabled Researchers (TIGER) 

The intent of the TIGER project is to implement and evaluate a ""campus bridge"" model that addresses the growing need for Cyber-Infrastructure (CI) support for researchers at campuses of every size requiring resources that may not be of petascale size, but that outstrip the infrastructure that can be supported at most institutions.  The project will support regional access to HPC/HTC facilities, computational and visualization expertise as well as leveraging of expertise from each participating institution. Computational nodes for regional use have already been purchased via prior EPSCoR and DoE awards. The two HBCU partners will be connected to the regional R&E network via previously awarded ESPCoR RII 2 and ESPCoR CI R2 awards. A key task is to provide expert implementation and integration services and also increase the size of the workforce having this skill sets. 

The project will extend the campus experience to a regional one, funding a collaboration of Clemson expertise and faculty at comprehensives and HBCUs  and will expand and grow cyber-enabled knowledge discovery communities. A successful outcome is potentially transformative in providing a new model shown to enable and grow a broad and diverse cyber-enabled research community at a regional scale, leveraging strengths at a regional center of CI expertise.",NSF,4900,CLEMSON UNIVERSITY,230 Kappa Street,CLEMSON,US,,SC03,Clemson University,SC,296345701,47.070,"['Jill  Gemmill', 'James M Pepin', 'Timothy A Davis', 'Jennifer  Cash']",09/15/2010,042629816,299887,09/30/2012,4900,CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE,299887,1063679,042629816,James R Bottum,230 Kappa Street,CLEMSON,US,,SC03,Clemson University,SC,296345701,jb@clemson.edu,James,Bottum,R,8646568100,@nsf.gov,,,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The TIGER project implemented and evaluated a ""campus bridge"" model.

CI resources are moving into ""cloud services"" which can potentially be located anywhere and in some ways may be considered to be 'ubiquitous'; success in using such resources increasingly depends on expertise in use and integration of these services in a collaboration of technology and domain scientists. The key finding is that providing expert cyberinfrastructure implementation/integration services in conjunction with access to computational resources will increase use of computational approaches in multiple disciplines and increase the size of the workforce having this skill set. 

The TIGER project had a four-prong strategy in successfully completing the campus bridge model goal. 

1.              Enable access to existing campus resources, including ClemsonÆs Palmetto high performance computing cluster.


Participating users (both faculty and students) at Claflin University, Francis Marion University (FMU), and South Carolina State University (SCSU) were provided with user accounts on ClemsonÆs Palmetto HPC cluster. Claflin is a private HBCU, Francis Marion is a public Minority Serving Institution, and SCSU is a public HBCU.  Accounts included 100 GB of backed-up storage space in user home directories, as well as unlimited access to a shared 6 TB backed-up storage space.  A high-priority job queue on the cluster was established exclusively for these users.   Upon account creation, each user was introduced to the comprehensive collection of online user documentation available for the Palmetto cluster and to a computational scientist who would serve as that userÆs primary point-of-contact for user support.  The guidance and support was customized for each userÆs unique needs, enabling quick and effective adoption of the available resources.  Flexible customization of computational scientist support was key to enabling the target user community to find value in HPC resources and make use of those resources in their research activities.  Use of the Palmetto cluster and computational scientist support was funded by NSF EPS-0919440 (EPSCoR Track II).
 


2.              Connect to XSEDE facilities using regional network facilities funded by NSF ARI-R2 and EPSCoR RII funds.


Network connections for SCSU and Claflin were provided using EPSCoR C2 funds (NSF Award EPS-1006833).  FMUÆs connection was funded by DOE XXX.  These connections are not in a regional connected model due to State regulation passed during the award period, but we are able to pass traffic to these locations going through the SoX GigaPOP in Atlanta. This has not caused any issues for this project. The sharing of data and access to computational resources has been at lower bandwidth and slower speeds than we would have liked but were adequate for the High Performance Computing (HPC) access needed for this project.

3.              Extend the campus experience to a regional model, facilitating a collaboration of Clemson expertise and faculty who interact with regional researchers and technical staff to grow cyber-enabled knowledge discovery communities


There are now over 130 external users involved in this bridging model.  The TIGER activity further built a regional community with interest in scientific visualization.

Proposal Number:	EPS - 1006919 
Institution:	University of Oklahoma Norman Campus
Project Director:	Henry J. Neeman

This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). 

This OK Inter-campus and Intra-campus Cyber Connectivity (RII C2) project would be led by the University of Oklahoma Norman Campus to benefit the entire state.

Intellectual Merit
Through the Oklahoma Optical Initiative (OOI), the OK RII C2 project plans to facilitate the ability to provision a substantial number of dedicated high performance connections, both within Oklahoma and to national and international networks (e.g., Internet2, NLR). OOI would transform Oklahoma's existing research ring from routed to optical, leveraging existing infrastructure while advancing optical switching components to a new level, facilitating substantial improvement in reliability, robustness, availability and potentially bandwidth, as well as enabling the ability to provision dedicated lambdas. This initiative will leverage extant and emerging investments by OneNet and University of Oklahoma (OU). 

Individual Oklahoma institutions will achieve substantial connectivity transformations, so they can take advantage of OOI. In particular: 
(a) OU's supercomputer will have its world-facing network connectivity upgraded to 10 Gbps (10X increase);
(b) OSU (Oklahoma State University) will be upgraded to 10 Gbps intra-campus (10x increase), from its current 1 Gbps intra-campus (but 10 Gbps ring-facing); 
(c) University of Tulsa will be upgraded to 1 Gbps (5X increase), for research use only, at no upcharge; 
(d) Langston University (LU) bandwidth for High Energy Physics (HEP) projects will be increased to 10 Gbps (100X increase), at no upcharge; 
(e) Noble bandwidth will be increased to 250 Mbps (5X increase) via a fiber Indefeasible Right to Use agreement, at no upcharge; 
(f) Rural and nonmetro connectivity will be improved, via redeploying extant optical components from the research ring to OneNet's remote hubsites. 
(g) The Oklahoma Telepresence Initiative will make High Definition telepresence available to all higher education campuses in Oklahoma.

Oklahoma currently has an RII Track 1 on bioenergy and an RII Track 2 on ecoinformatics. The Track 1, a collaboration among Oklahoma State University, the University of Oklahoma and the Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation (Noble), isn't a large consumer of network connectivity, but Noble currently is at only 45 Mbps, expected to be inadequate for emerging needs; the Track1 also includes the Oklahoma Cyberinfrastructure Initiative (OCII), which provides CI resources to 540 users at 24 institutions (including 11 of Oklahoma's 13 public universities), mostly without usage charges. The Track 2, a collaboration among OU, OSU, the University of Kansas and Kansas State University, uses substantial data, with constant collection and transformation of NASA data made available from a web portal. 

Other Data-Intensive Projects include: 
(a) Oklahoma has been a longstanding leader in meteorology research, especially in real time forecasting of severe storms, including: the Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms; the Linked Environment for Atmospheric Discovery collaboration (NSF Large Information Technology Research); development of the Advanced Regional Prediction System as an NSF Science and Technology Center and now a key developer of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model; a just-awarded NSF Petascale Applications grant for Ensemble Kalman Filtering on the NSF's Blue Waters multi-petaflops system. 
(b) For the past 6 years, Oklahoma's DOE EPSCoR has supported a High Energy Physics collaboration among OU, OSU and LU, Oklahoma's only Historically Black University. In addition, OU and LU, with two other institutions, form the NSF-funded ATLAS Southwest Tier2 Center. At OU, HEP projects are expected to consume roughly 5 Gbps starting in 2010; at LU, campus networking capability is inadequate for LU's growing computing and data responsibilities. 
(c) The OU and OSU HPC centers support dozens of research teams. 
(d) The state's Science & Technology (S&T) plan includes bioenergy, plant science, weather and weather sensors, plus other areas that are supported under OCII but not called out in this RII C2 proposal.

Broader Impacts
The Oklahoma Networking Mentorship Program will provide networking professionals from OU and OneNet to institutions across the state (20 institutions have expressed interest), to deliver presentations on the practicalities of the networking profession and job shadowing opportunities, both physical and virtual. In addition, each of the science projects described has its own extensive education program, Oklahoma Cyber-infrastructure Initiative (OCII) has its longstanding and successful SiPE education program, and Oklahoma EPSCoR has comprehensive educational and outreach programs, links to economic development and to initiatives designed to enhance public awareness of the importance of science.

K-12 students and teachers are being exposed to cutting-edge science and CI through summer technology academies, mobile science vehicles, and teacher training workshops. Undergraduate student research experiences in industry and academia are supported and talented students are being recruited into bioenergy based graduate programs. Workshops are being geared towards the education, training and integration of CI in the outreach and research components of Oklahoma's RII projects. Conferences to encourage multidisciplinary, multi-campus collaborations and to enhance faculty competitiveness in future grant submissions are being supported. An entrepreneurial workshop, a business plan competition for students along with commercialization vouchers to assess the commercial potential of researcher's inventions would foster the spirit of entrepreneurship of both students and faculty. 

Along with publications, website and wiki, outcomes of this RII C2 project are proposed to be disseminated via the Oklahoma Supercomputing Symposium, which in 8 years has had over 2000 attendees from 84 academic institutions in 23 states and Puerto Rico (32 in Oklahoma and 19 in 12 other EPSCoR jurisdictions), including PhD-, masters- and bachelors-granting universities, community colleges, career techs, a high school and public school systems, as well as 79 private companies, 29 government agencies (21 in Oklahoma) and 13 non-governmental organizations.

RII education outreach initiatives embrace the inclusion of underrepresented groups and women, and strengthen competitiveness and diversity through collaboration with LU (Oklahoma's HBCU) and tribal college, facilitating transition from high school to college, providing culture-attuned counseling support, and promoting enhancement programs to retain students pursuing STEM disciplines. Other initiatives promote effective communication of scientific advances to enhance public awareness of the value of science to the state legislature and the general public. Collectively, the RII investments would position Oklahoma to enhance competitiveness for mainstream NSF funding.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA,201 Stephenson Parkway,NORMAN,US,Norman,OK04,University of Oklahoma Norman Campus,OK,730199705,47.083,"['Dana  Brunson', 'James  Deaton']",08/18/2010,848348348,1176470,08/31/2013,4900,EPSCoR Research Infrastructure,1176470,1006919,046862181,Henry J Neeman,201 Stephenson Parkway,NORMAN,US,Norman,OK04,University of Oklahoma Norman Campus,OK,730199705,hneeman@ou.edu,Henry,Neeman,J,4053255386,@nsf.gov,,,040101 RRA RECOVERY ACT,"The Oklahoma Optical Initiative (OOI), Oklahoma's National Science Foundation EPSCoR Cyber Connectivity (C2) grant, was designed to address four objectives: (1) upgrading Oklahoma's statewide ""ring"" network; (2) upgrading individual institutions' research and education connectivity; (3) a statewide telepresence initiative to provide high end videoconferencing capability; (4) a statewide workforce development initiative to expose Computer Science (CS) and Information Technology (IT) students statewide to the profession of IT.

Accomplishments:

(1) Statewide Ring Network Upgrade

The statewide ring's five sites -- Tulsa, where the University of Tulsa (TU) is located, Stillwater, where the main campus of Oklahoma State University (OSU) is located, Norman, where the University of Oklahoma (OU) main campus is located, Oklahoma City (OKC), where the OU Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) is located, and Oklahoma City Community College (OCCC) -- were upgraded from routed ""mux/demux"" devices to Reconfigurable Optical Add Drop Modules, allowing new 10 Gbps (10 billion bits per second) network circuits to be created quickly and affordably.

(2) Institutional Connectivity Upgrades

(a) OSU's supercomputer connectivity was upgraded from 1 Gbps to initially 10 Gbps and soon 20 Gbps (20x increase). During 2007-11,

OSU awarded the 2nd most PhDs to American Indian/Alaska Native (AI) students in the US.

These students built Wilson-Cloud chambers to detect radioactive particles, used different colored candies to learn about light absorption and designing materials to absorb light for solar cell applications, became ?geologists for a day? as they explored current issues related to petroleum engineering, and gazed into the future of DNA nanotechnology and DNA origami. Each of these activities involved a unique partnership between a STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) graduate student at the University of Wyoming and a Wyoming teacher.  These partnerships were made possible through the EENano program, an NSF GK-12 project.

From 2010 to 2016, the EENano program fostered partnerships with over 30 Wyoming teachers to engage middle and high school students from rural communities in real-world STEM activities.  During this time, 25 PhD and Master?s students were supported and given training to enable them to successfully communicate the intricacies of their research through engaging and hands-on activities.  Each graduate student?s research was related to nanotechnology, an emerging field with which many middle- and high- school teachers and students were unfamiliar. 

The heart of the EENano project was the collaboration between Partner Teachers and Graduate Fellows, and there was a significant impact on both. Fellows received training to develop their Energy and or Nanotechnology lessons using the principles of inquiry. Partner Teachers appreciated the infusion of new activities and ideas to their curriculum, and their students appreciated learning in an inquiry-driven and hands-on atmosphere. Graduate Fellows learned how to best present their research in an interactive, engaging, and understandable method. Partner Teachers were challenged to teach outside their comfort zone and to learn more about nanotechnology, engineering, energy and environmental topics.  

For Partner Teachers, Fellows, and Wyoming students, the EENano Program provided opportunities to help teachers (and schools) incorporate new ideas and cutting-edge research in STEM fields into existing STEM curriculum. By taking Energy and Environmental Nanotechnology research and sharing it at an age-appropriate level, three major goals were met, all in sync:

ONE: Fellows gained confidence and leadership skills, broadened their understanding of nanotechnology and their own areas of research. Through teaching and collaboration they increased their communication skills and learned to contribute as part of a team. Making their research understandable to a non-technical audience gave Fellows new insights on their own research and their field in general as well as a deeper understanding and renewed passion for their field as they got caught up in student excitement at doing their hands-on, ?real? science activities.
TWO: Partner Teachers gained insight into nanotechnology and the cultures and practices of science. Their students not only got to interact with practicing scientists but also were able to see real-world connections between the science in their textbooks and cutting-edge research. Partner Teachers also learned about current research happening at the University, which helped reignite their own passion for teaching science and updated their content knowledge. The lessons and activities devised and implemented by Graduate Fellows within Partner Teacher classrooms were designed to provide content-rich and research-current activities Partner Teachers can integrate in their courses. This extends the reach of the program beyond the students who worked with the Graduate Fellows to the Partner Teacher?s future students.
THREE: Allowing Wyoming K-12 students to do ?real? science with a ?real? scientist or engineer increased their interest for STEM fields. By connecting Graduate Fellows' research with what the teacher is teaching and showing students concrete examples of when, indeed, they will use ""all that stuff"", this program gave middle and high school students a taste of where science and engineering can take them &ndash; and why it is so important. Graduate Fellows are inspiring the next generation of scientists and engineers &ndash; helping these students picture themselves as the future STEM leaders.

Title:  		MRI/Acq.: Acq. of a Supercomputer by the Front Range Computing Consortium

Project Proposed:
This project, acquiring instrumentation to investigate and address the technical obstacles to practical petascale computing for CU-Denver, CU-Boulder, and NCAR, explores the interplay of multi-core, intra-socket and inter-node parallelism in a variety of applications and additionally studies extreme application scalability, (issues critical to the petascale era). The work enables the researchers from the Front Range Computing Consortium (FRCC) to make discoveries in multiple areas through the supercomputing instrument with peak performance (over 100 TeraFLOPs). Access to this critical state-of-the-art Track 3 computational instrumentation enables HPC-driven problems such as Earth-System Sciences (e.g., climatology, critical oceanography, meteorology, land surface dynamics), Biotechnology (e.g., genomics, structural biology, microbial ecology), renewable energy applications; Material Science (e.g., nano-structured composites), turbulence, turbulent magnetic dynamos, and laser-plasma acceleration, and Computational Science. The instrument proposed combines Sun?s highest density Constellation assemblies, Intel?s next generation Nehalem-EP microprocessors, a custom InfiniBand QDR-based mesh interconnect, NVIDIA accelerators, and Sun Thumper storage modules to produce a highly balanced I/O rich, and cost-effective computing system. This new instrument, deployed within the integrated framework of the FRCC, offers a broad spectrum of investigators the necessary computational ecosystem to advance their research and strengthen their collaborations with national laboratories. Because the HPC manifested by NSF cyber-infrastructure hierarchy calls for ?a significant number of systems with peak performance in the 50-500 teraflops range, deployed and supported on the local level by individual campuses and research organizations,? the instrument fits into the NSF cyber-infrastructure hierarchy as a track 3 system and will have a software environment that allows it to peer seamlessly with other NSF cyber-infrastructure investments. Exhibiting potential to benefit other Directorates and Offices, this work undoubtedly directly benefits GEO, MPS, BIO, ENG, OCI, and CISE.

Broader Impacts:
This project brings together a broad and diverse set of disciplines to focus on key research priorities. The Consortium also decreases the barrier for collaboration between researchers at institutions along the Front Range, thereby accelerating scientific discovery, increasing scientific productivity, and fostering vibrant HPC ecology. Moreover, the instrumentation facilitates focused education, training, outreach, and support. Courses offered through this initiative are a vital component of training the next generation of scientists and engineers in the areas of modeling and scientific computing, numerical analysis, applied analysis, and high performance computing. The instrumentation supports ten historically black colleges and universities through distance learning courses and leverages existing mentoring programs such as NCAR?s Summer Internship in Parallel Computational Science (SIParCS), UCAR?s Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science program (SOARS), and the CU Boulder?s Summer Multicultural Access to Research Training (SMART) programs.",NSF,4900,"REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO, THE","3100 Marine Street, Room 481",Boulder,US,Boulder,CO02,University of Colorado at Boulder,CO,803031058,47.070,"['Jan  Mandel', 'James P Syvitski', 'Richard D Loft', 'Keith  Julien']",07/07/2008,007431505,2796500,07/31/2013,4900,MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION,2796500,0821794,007431505,Henry M Tufo,"3100 Marine Street, Room 481",Boulder,US,Boulder,CO02,University of Colorado at Boulder,CO,803031058,tufo@cs.colorado.edu,Henry,Tufo,M,3034922771,rrodrigu@nsf.gov,Rita V.

""The New Role of Science and Engineering in Risk Reduction""


In February 2002, NSF funded a successful workshop in New York City, inspired by the events of September 11, to develop a research agenda related to unexpected events.  Now, one year later and with the Department of Homeland Security established, the topic of homeland security is much better defined as it relates to the Federal Government and NSF.  NSF is now engaged in developing a large cross-agency initiative in Cyber-Infrastructure.  The workshop being funded by this grant is intended to bring the two areas of cyber-infrastructure and homeland security into juxtaposition, with the goal of developing a computer/information science research agenda within the context of homeland security, as related to cyber-infrastructure.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",Office of Contract & Grant Admin,La Jolla,US,La Jolla,CA49,University of California-San Diego,CA,920930934,47.070,"['Larry L Smarr', 'Frieder  Seible']",04/18/2003,804355790,200000,03/31/2005,4900,DIGITAL GOVERNMENT,200000,0309195,071549000,Ramesh R Rao,Office of Contract & Grant Admin,La Jolla,US,La Jolla,CA49,University of California-San Diego,CA,920930934,rrao@ucsd.edu,Ramesh,Rao,R,8585346433,@nsf.gov,,,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,,04/15/2003,DG:  The New Role of Science and Engineering in Risk Reduction,Grant
181,"The project creates high-performance algorithms for discovering and validating parameterized probabilistic models against formal specifications of their expected behavior. Probabilistic models naturally describe the impact of uncertainties on the behavior of many real-world systems including probabilistically correct computing devices, autonomous cyber-physical systems, and multi-outcome predictive models. Parameters in computational models are employed to represent incompleteness in the knowledge about the system being described - either due to a lack of sufficient experimental insight or due to the need for constructing template designs that can be reused. The analysis and synthesis techniques for probabilistic systems developed in this project could have a broad impact since many important real-world systems are probabilistic in nature. 

The project exploits the synergy between Bayesian risk analysis and change of probability measures to design new model validation algorithms that expose rare but interesting behaviors of computational models. By leveraging theoretical results in randomized metric embeddings and practical advances in extreme-scale computing, the project creates new parallel algorithms for synthesizing parameters of probabilistic models from a suite of behavioral specifications. The project uses computational models of biochemical and cyber-physical systems as benchmarks for evaluation, and creates a web-based cyber-infrastructure for rapid dissemination of the algorithms to the wider community. The project will accelerate the design of complex predictive models by automatically validating them against multiple historical observations. It will also enable a formal methods based uncertainty quantification framework for analyzing the correctness of intelligent cyber-physical systems - thereby, making these devices safer.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA BOARD OF TRUSTEES, THE",4000 CNTRL FLORIDA BLVD,ORLANDO,US,Orlando,FL07,University of Central Florida,FL,328168005,47.070,,07/02/2014,150805653,487627,06/30/2019,4900,SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION,503627,1422257,159621697,Sumit K Jha,4000 Central Florida Blvd,Orlando,US,Orlando,FL07,University of Central Florida,FL,328263252,jha@eecs.ucf.edu,Sumit,Jha,K,4078822215,namla@nsf.gov,Nina Amla,7032928910,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,"['Faraz Hussain, Christopher J Langmead, Qi Mi, Joyeeta Dutta-Moscato, Yoram Vodovotz and Sumit K Jha~Automated parameter estimation for biological models using Bayesian statistical model checking~BMC Bioinformatics~16~2015~S8~~10.1186/1471-2105-16-S17-S8~0~ ~0~ ~04/05/2016 23:55:39.136000000', 'Arvind Ramanathan, Laura Pullum, Faraz Hussain, Dwaipayan Chakraborty, Sumit Kumar Jha~Integrating symbolic and statistical methods for testing intelligent systems: Applications to machine learning and computer vision.~Design, Automation, and Test in Europe (DATE)~~2016~786~~978-3-9815370-6-2~0~ ~0~ ~24/05/2017 22:53:25.603000000']",07/01/2014,SHF: Small: Exascale Formal Verification Algorithms for Parameterized Probabilistic Models of Complex Computational Systems,Grant

Title:   ARI-R2: 
Modernization of Multi-scale Characterization, Analysis, and Synthesis
Facility for Materials and Devices: Remote Access, Visualization, and Public
Engagement 





The University of North Texas (UNT) has renovated and modernized
its existing Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART) into a modern, unique facility by consolidating currently spatially dispersed advanced characterization and analysis instruments, upgrading the space to include cyber network tools, and by integrating the CART space with a clean room and technology incubator; thereby creating the UNT Nanofabrication Analysis and Research Facility (NARF) - an open-access ""one-stop-shop"" for advanced device fabrication and analysis across multiple length and time scales.

The project research outcomes and education activities that
address intellectual merit and broader impacts are discussed below.

Intellectual Merit: This renovated facility occupies ~5000 sq. ft. of research space employing an ""Open system design"" architecture to maximize collaboration and shared use of equipment, ""Integration for fabrication"" to
maximize entrepreneurial activities characterized by co-location of clean room
and technology incubator, and a ""community/school-friendly"" setting, whereby students and other researchers have opportunities to share the results and explain their work in real-time or via distance. The renovated facility hosts a unique trio of tools consisting of a dual-beam focused ion beam instrument, a high resolution transmission electron microscope, and a local electrode atom probe, capable of true atomic scale analysis of the structure and chemistry of materials as well as many other advanced instruments, into direct proximity of one another. UNT research employing this facility has already led to significant fundamental insights into atomic and nanoscale phenomena in aerospace structural materials, attracting a multi-million dollars contract from the Air Force, and is also playing a critical role in the development of a novel atomically precise manufacturing process (DARPA). Other UNT projects that have benefited from the renovation include molecular electronics, OLEDs, nanowires/nanotubes PVD and CVD of ceramic and metallic nanostructured thin films, organic nanocomposites, bio-inspired products, and nanomechanics which have been extensively supported by NSF CMMI and DMR. This renovated facility also has cyber infrastructure and mounted IT network devices to increase collaborative, interdisciplinary programs
between researchers located at the different UNT campuses. The renovation and development of the NARF facility, using ARI-R2 funding, has substantially improved research and training of undergraduate/graduate students and postdocs in advanced structural and hybrid aerospace materials; design, synthesis and characterization of devices based on molecular electronics; chemical synthesis of nanoparticles, quantum dots, nanotubes and nanowires; and surface engineering of coatings for various applications.

Broader Impacts: The renovated NARF is already having a substantial impact on undergraduate and graduate education in the nano-sciences and technology. The facility has been redesigned, under the ARI-R2 project, to maximize external collaborations with industry, national labs, and, academia at the regional, national, and, international levels via the installation of cyber-connectivity.  Secondly, the close proximity of this facility to UNTÆs technology incubator for start-up companies makes it ideally suited for technology transfer activities. Thirdly, educational outreach has been maximized via an IT platform, designed for the visiting public, using glass-walls, interactive video, and interpretation by researchers and graduate students. Several recent activities since the completion of renovation, such as ASM Materials Camp (July 2013) have involved teaching high school students, many of whom were women and under...",,,10/01/2010,"Modernization of Multi-Scale Characterization, Analysis, and Synthesis Facility for Materials and Devices",Grant

With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multiuser program (CRIF:MU), Alec M. Wodtke from the University of California Santa Barbara will acquire a gas chromatograph time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer (MS) for the Mass Spectrometry Facility of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. The high resolution instrument will have several ionization sources such as electron ionization (EI), chemical ionization (CI) and field desorption/field ionization (FI/FD) suitable for small molecule analysis. In addition to supporting researchers at this institution, cyber-enabling of the spectrometer will support remote data access for scientists and students in other campus departments and area institutions such as Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo, Westmont College-Santa Barbara, Cal State University-Channel Islands, Cal State-Sacramento. The cyber infrastructure will also support educational and outreach initiatives via real-time remote instrument access in both college and high school chemistry courses. Research areas that will be impacted by this spectrometer include among others: the study of marine natural products with wound healing properties, total synthesis of natural products, optoelectric properties of organic materials, the development of new transition metal mediated chemical processes and environmentally sustainable chemical synthesis.


TOF-mass spectrometry with ionization capabilities is an excellent technique for obtaining accurate molecular weights on small and large molecules.

184,"The study of engineering can advance the problem solving and critical thinking ability of all students and prepare them for the technological workplace.  Early exposure to engineering principles may increase all students' interest in STEM fields, while embedding problems in social issues may aid in the recruiting of underrepresented groups to the STEM enterprise.  The INSPIRES program implements these ideas and tests their impact on learning and teaching.  The face-to-face workshops used in the INSPIRES program at Purdue are extended through cyber-infrastructure with the use of video-based mentoring in real time and an asynchronous learning experience.   A video and audio network links elementary school teachers with researchers and educators at Purdue to form a community of practice dedicated to implementing engineering education at the elementary grades.  A learning progression, based on the Engineering is Elementary and model-eliciting mathematics materials, is developed for elementary school teachers to increase their ability to adapt and refine engineering learning materials in their classrooms.  Existing assessment instruments will be revised and new ones developed, as necessary, to measure the impact of the professional development that includes engineering on teacher, student, administrator and parent knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors about engineering and engineering education.  The research plan identifies the changes in teacher and student knowledge, the abilities and behaviors resulting from the introduction of engineering, and the attributes of face-to-face and cyber-enabled teacher professional development and community building that can transform teachers into master users and designers of engineering education for elementary learners.

Educators, policymakers, industry and parents are seeing the value of teaching engineering to students in elementary school. Early findings of doing so show engineering could advance all studentsÆ critical thinking and problem-solving abilities and prepare them for an increasingly technical workplace. The early exposure to engineering principles may interest students in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields, while a vision of engineering as being socially relevant may aid in recruiting underrepresented groups to STEM fields. However, a lack of teacher training with elementary engineering content and elementary studentsÆ ability to learn engineering are seen as hurdles to implementation. Through this five-year research project, the research team sought to investigate the impact of teacher training with elementary engineering on teacher practice, student learning, and the greater school community, including administration and parents.  
Working with a very large school district in south central United States, the research team provided professional development for teachers in grades two to four through a summer academy and ongoing support. During the academic year, with research team support, teachers introduced their students to the definitions of engineering and technology, the work of engineers, and the engineering design process. Then teachers engaged their students in an Engineering is Elementary (http://www.eie.org) design activity linked to science content already being taught. Teachers returned the following summer for an additional three days of professional development with engineering and then went back to their classrooms to teach engineering for a second year.  Four cohorts of teachers (more than 160 total) participated anywhere from one to five years. Their students (over 3000), many from underserved populations, were impacted during their involvement, which ranged from one to three years.
Research findings related to students show that even with limited engineering instruction per year (less than 13 hours) there can be positive changes in studentsÆ understanding of the work of an engineer and engineering design, technology, and science concepts as well as the notion that engineers create and design technologies. They can identify steps in the engineering design process.  These changes can affect boys and girls in equal measure, and exposure to engineering in second grade can prepare students for greater learning of engineering in future years.
Research findings related to teachers suggest that teachersÆ impact on student learning of engineering improves with experience and continued professional development with engineering.  Teachers in their first year of teaching with engineering focus on the logistics of bringing engineering lessons and new teaching strategies into their classrooms.  In the second year, they focus more on integrating engineering with other subject matter (e.g. reading, math, science), enabling a richer educational experience for their students.  Teachers saw improved student performance, such as learning to participate in a team, solving problems with more than one answer, and recovering from failed design attempts.  Teachers also report that students are enthusiastic about the hands-on engineering lessons. Research findings also suggest administrative support is necessary for successful and continued use of new teaching strategies.

186,"Modern critical infrastructure relies on successful interdependent function among many different types of networks. For example, the Internet depends on access to the power grid, which in turn depends on the power-grid communication network and the energy production network. For this reason, network science researchers have begun examining the robustness of critical infrastructure as a network of networks, or a multilayer network. Research in network anomaly detection systems has focused on single network structures (specifically, the Internet as a single network). Among these methods, some promising detection algorithms rely on decentralized and distributed coordination among many participants, improving meaningfully over results from independent parallel and centralized algorithms. The project involves rigorous analysis of the different challenges and opportunities for anomaly detection posed by multilayer networks relative to single network structures, with a particular focus on how cross-layer information can be effectively used to improve both efficiency and detection as well as how cross-layer threats can create vulnerabilities. 

The project develops a general framework that can be used in multiple applications to detect large-scale threats to information flow for enhanced security.

187,"The Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) will become a focus of scientific research, education and scientific collaboration for the worldwide community of computational molecular scientists.  The MolSSI aims to reach these goals by engaging the computational molecular science community in multiple ways to remove barriers between innovations that often occur in small single-researcher groups and the implementation of these ideas in software that is used in the production of science by the entire community. Thus, great ideas will not languish in the ""just get the science right"" mode, but be incorporated into usable software for the wider community to enable bigger and better molecular science. The MolSSI will catalyze significant advances in software infrastructure, education, standards, and best-practices. These advances are critical because they are needed to address the next set of grand challenges in molecular science. Activities catalyzed by the Institute will improve the interoperability of the software used by the community, make easier the use of this software on the varied and heterogenous computing architectures that currently exist, enable greater scalability of existing and emerging theoretical models, as well as substantially improving the training of molecular-science students in software design and engineering. Through the range of outreach efforts by its multiple institutions, the MolSSI will engage the community to increase the diversity of its workforce by more effectively attracting and retaining students and faculty from underrepresented groups.  All of these endeavors will result in fundamentally and dramatically improved molecular science software and its usage, that will reduce or eliminate the current delays - often by years - in the practical realization of theoretical innovations.  Ultimately, the Institute will enable computational scientists to more easily navigate future disruptive transitions in computing technology, and most importantly, tackle problems that are orders of magnitude larger and more complex than those currently within their grasp and to realize new, more ambitious scientific objectives. This will accelerate the translation of basic science into new technologies essential to the vitality of the economy and environment, and to compete globally with Europe, Japan, and other countries that are making aggressive investments in advanced cyber-infrastructure.

The MolSSI aims to reach these goals by engaging the computational molecular science community in multiple ways to remove barriers between innovations that often occur in small single- principle investigator groups and the implementation of these ideas in software that is used in the production of science by the entire community. The MolSSI will create a sustainable Molecular Sciences Consortium that will develop use cases and standards for code and data sharing across the software ecosystem and become a focus of scientific research, education and scientific collaboration for the worldwide community of computational molecular scientists.  The Institute will create an interdisciplinary team of Software Scientists who will help develop software frameworks, interact with community code developers, collaborate with partners in cyber-infrastructure, form mutually productive coalitions with industry, government labs, and international efforts, and ultimately serve as future experts and leaders. In addition, the Institute will support and mentor a cohort of Software Fellows actively developing code infrastructure in research groups across the U.S., and, in turn, they will engage in MolSSI outreach and education activities within the larger molecular science community.  Through a range of multi-institutional outreach efforts, the Institute will engage the community to increase the diversity of its workforce by more effectively attracting and retaining students and faculty from underrepresented groups.  The Institute will educate the next generation of software developers by providing workshops, summer schools, on-line forums, and a Professional Master's program in molecular simulation and software engineering.  MolSSI will be guided by an internal Board of Directors and an external Science and Software Advisory Board, both comprised of leaders in the field, who will work together with the Software Scientists and Fellows to establish the key software priorities.  MolSSI will be sustained by a mix of labor contributed by the community, revenue from education programs and license revenues.

190,"The objective of this project is to develop a data-driven smart monitoring methodology of Alzheimer?s disease (AD). AD follows an accelerated degradation trajectory as compared to normal aging. Accurate monitoring and prognosis of the disease trajectory is critical for the success of many preventative interventions. Currently, no first-line screening system for monitoring the fast-growing preclinical population is available. While emerging personalized health screening systems provide the infrastructure to routinely screen massive numbers of individuals, it is an essential challenge to transform the role of these systems from passive information collection into smart monitoring to proactively characterize the underlying complex time-varying disease trajectory shaped by an individual?s risk factors. This project aims at developing such a ?smart monitoring? approach that will equip nowadays cyber infrastructure with powerful data-driven decision-making capabilities for better management of the preclinical individuals, leading to more efficient targeted screening and affordable care, better treatment planning and management, and improved quality of life for both patients and caregivers.

192,"The Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) supports a diverse community of experts who model Earth surface processes. It does so by developing, supporting, and disseminating integrated software modules that predict the movement of fluids, and the flux (production, erosion, transport, and deposition) of sediment and solutes in landscapes and their sedimentary basins.  CSDMS provides open-access to numerical models, maintains data for modelers and educational resources on earth science modeling for teachers, provides computing resources for members, offers help in advanced model coupling, and is a platform of discussion for earth science research.

This project aims to enhance the CSDMS cyber-infrastructure.  The current CSDMS Modeling Framework will be extended for use within a web browser, on a wider variety of computational platforms, and on other high performance computing clusters to ensure robustness and sustainability of the framework. Community-generated models will be converted into ?plug-and-play? components through the development of automated wrapping tools. Methods for quantifying model uncertainty will be adapted. Benchmarking data will be incorporated into the CSDMS modeling framework to support model inter-comparison. Finally, a robust mechanism for ingesting and utilizing semantic mediation databases will also be developed within the Modeling Framework.  In addition, six new community initiatives will be pursued: 1) an Earth - ecosystem modeling initiative to capture ecosystem dynamics and ensuing interactions with landscapes, 2) a geodynamics initiative to investigate the interplay among climate, geomorphology, and tectonic processes, 3) an Anthropocene modeling initiative, to incorporate mechanistic models of human influences, 4) a coastal vulnerability modeling initiative, with emphasis on deltas and their multiple threats and stressors, 5) a continental margin modeling initiative, to capture extreme oceanic and atmospheric events generating turbidity currents in the Gulf of Mexico, and 6) a CZO Focus Research Group, to develop compatibility between CSDMS architecture and protocols and Critical Zone Observatory-developed models and data.

CSDMS streamlines the computer modeling of myriad societally relevant processes, including melting glaciers, landslides, erosion, wetland evolution, water cycling, flooding, and coastal change. Through its community support mechanisms, CSDMS catalyzes the process of idea generation and hypothesis testing, enabling the rapid creation and application of models tailored to specific settings, scientific problems, and time scales. CSDMS? community approach allows the efficient development of models that are more powerful than could be developed by any single group ? redundancy is reduced, models are better vetted, the capability for innovation is expanded, and energy can be focused towards earth-surface domains that are poorly represented or controversial. CSDMS ensures that models are accessible and transparent by soliciting and publishing model documentation. Staff at the CSDMS Integration Facility convert models into modules that can be easily coupled together; this modularity gives rise to new applications for existing software.  This new award will enable CSDMS to enhance its cyber-infrastructure by developing: 1) software products and approaches designed to be accessible, easy to use, and relevant, 2) new community initiatives to advance earth-surface process modeling across many disciplines, and 3) educational products and training workshops aimed at various entry levels.",NSF,4900,"REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO, THE","3100 Marine Street, Room 481",Boulder,US,Boulder,CO02,University of Colorado at Boulder,CO,803031058,47.050,,10/12/2012,007431505,4074999,09/30/2019,4900,GEOINFORMATICS,5690110,1226297,007431505,Gregory E Tucker,"3100 Marine Street, Room 481",Boulder,US,Boulder,CO02,University of Colorado at Boulder,CO,803031058,gtucker@colorado.edu,Gregory,Tucker,E,3034926985,ryuretic@nsf.gov,Richard Yuretich,7032924744,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,"['Van Dijk., A.I.J.M., Brakenridge, G.R., Kettner, A.J., Beck, H.E., and de Groeve, T.~River gauging at global scale using optical and passive microwave remote sensing.~Water Resources Research~52~2016~6404~~DOI: 10.1002/2015WR018545~0~ ~0~ ~16/08/2017 14:43:01.936000000', ""Williams M, J Zalasiewicz, CN Waters, M Edgeworth, C Bennett, AD Barnosky, EC Ellis, MA Ellis, A Cearreta, PK Haff, JA Ivar do Sul, R Leinfelder, JR McNeill, E Odada, N Oreskes, A Revkin, D deB Richter, W Steffen, C Summerhayes, JP Syvitski, D Vidas, M Wa~The Anthropocene: a conspicuous stratigraphical signal of anthropogenic changes in production and consumption across the biosphere.~Earth's Future~4~2016~34~~~0~ ~0~ ~16/08/2017 14:43:01.943000000"", 'Zalasiewicz, J, CN Waters, AP Wolfe, AD Barnosky, A Cearreta, M Edgeworth, EC Ellis, IJ Fairchild, FM Gradstein, J Grinevald, P Haff, MJ.

193,"The Quake-Catcher Network (QCN) is a transformative approach to earthquake detection, science, and outreach. The QCN is a distributed computing project that links internal (no cost, built-in) or external (low cost, USB-based) accelerometers connected to any participating computer for earthquake research.
Leveraging an innovative set of cyber-enabled seismic observations, this approach will enable the creation of a very dense, low-cost seismic network that can explore earthquake fault rupture in real-time, establish ground response to seismic wave passage, and quantify the shaking effects on critical structures. Results from a one-year exploratory grant from the NSF Cyber-Infrastructure Teaching, Education, Advancement and Mentoring program indicate QCN has the ability to be a new and transformative type of network, which is scalable and easy to deploy world-wide. Increasing the number of QCN sensors from 1,000 to more than 30,000 worldwide and developing efficient schemes to ingest, process, and distribute Terabytes of data will allow us to (1) explore fault mechanics (including directionality, slip distribution, and rupture velocity) at unprecedented resolutions, (2) study ground motions to assess seismic hazard and building response and (3) analyze data in real time for earthquake early warning and rapid response. This proposal will result in network with 6,000 new USB sensors and tens of thousands of no-cost sensors
commonly built internal to laptops and other devices. Additionally, QCN will provide the cyberinfrastructure to process and analyze the large new seismic data sets in near-real time and to foster collaboration between 1000?s of researchers and interested participants around the world. The framework
laid by this project will enable rapid expansion of the network internationally and will allow us to grow the network at a fraction of the cost of traditional seismic instrumentation and infrastructure, providing valuable data to augment the existing seismic networks.The success of the Quake-Catcher Network is intrinsically linked to the broader participation of the general public; members of the public, schools (K-12, undergraduate and graduate), and community organizations host QCN sensors. These ?citizen-scientists? will receive real-time earthquake information, seismic data and results, and interactive educational materials.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,210 Hullihen Hall,Newark,US,Newark,DE00,University of Delaware,DE,197162553,47.050,,09/24/2010,059007500,88018,09/30/2014,4900,CDI TYPE II,100961,1027807,059007500,Michela  Taufer,210 Hullihen Hall,Newark,US,Newark,DE00,University of Delaware,DE,197162553,taufer@utk.edu,Michela,Taufer,,3026907845,ezanzerk@nsf.gov,Eva E.

seismic networks by involving the general public in the
collection, detection, and recognition of seismic events.  The
Quake-Catcher Network (QCN) is a large network of low-cost
sensors connected to computers, both desktops and laptops, owned
by volunteer participants around the world to monitor seismic
events. The QCN architecture is built upon the Berkeley Open
Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) software for
volunteer computing. BOINC enables QCN hosts to efficiently
report ``triggers'', i.e., indications of probable seismic
activity at the host location, to a project server at Stanford
University in California, USA.

The location and density of the QCN sensors can impact the
accuracy of event detection. Testing different arrangements of
new sensors could disrupt the currently active project, thus this
experiment is best accomplished in a simulated environment. With
the proper sensor density and locations, QCN can augment
traditional earthquake detection networks and improve their
ability to quickly detect moderate to strong earthquakes, with
per-sensor costs well below those of these other networks.

In this project we studied the design and implementation aspects
of trustworthy QCN networks of low-cost sensors.  To address the
problem, we designed and implemented an accurate and efficient
framework for simulating the low cost QCN sensors and identifying
their most effective locations and densities. To build the
framework, we extended and existing simulator of volunteer
computing projects to handle the trickle messages generated by
sensors connected to volunteerÆs hosts and sent to the QCN server
when strong ground motion is detected. The simulator allowed us
to rigorously study QCN simulations at 100,000 or even 1,000,000
sensors, highlight strengths and weaknesses of different sensor
density and placement, and test the network with various
parameters, conditions, and earthquake scenarios. Our simulations
also outlined that the master-worker topology in QCN and other
similar projects is a major weakness. For example, the
centralized master can fail to collect data if the volunteers'
computers cannot connect to the network, or it can introduce
significant delays in the warning if the network is congested. We
solved the problems associated to this weakness by using multiple
servers in a more advanced network topology than the simple
master-worker configuration. We considered several critical
scenarios modeling the 1986 Oceanside earthquake, occurs in the
region of San Diego (CA). Results obtained with the simulation of
these scenarios and using our framework showed how our
simulations can reliably enable the study diverse sensor
densities and seismic scenarios under different geographical and
infrastructural constraints.

We integrated the simulator in an educational tool that is hosted
on Amazon AWS and is accessible to the public called QCN
Explorer (http://qcnexplorer.org/). QCN Explorer allows users to
study any earthquake scenario on the earth through simulations of
the Quake Catcher Network in an easy-to-use and friendly browser
environment. The goal of this interface is to educate people
about seismology and to increase the awareness on the science
beyond earthquake monitoring and predictions. For example, QCN
Explorer allows users to simulate how QCN responds to an
earthquake with a larger number of sensors than the network
currently supports. The simulator is free for anyone to use and
will be maintained online beyond the duration of the project.

194,"Modeling and simulations of crystallization/solidification of materials for understanding a given material's microscopic structure and final properties have spawned significant advances in today's explorations of new nano-materials and devices in materials sciences and engineering. In the past decade, many computational models have been developed to partially simulate the crystallization and solidification on either microscopic or macroscopic scales. However, a generalized model to develop microscopic (molecular, meso-scale) calculations with macroscopic computations has not been developed, due to the model's complexity on multiple scales and validity of computational power.
This research involves developing a computational infrastructure that includes a large-scale microscopic and macroscopic model of crystallization/solidification of nanostructure materials, and associated high performance computational algorithms and numerical methods, using the cyber-infrastructure-enabled computing resources and facilities. The investigators will develop an integrated software package which can systematically solve many challenges in the modeling and simulation of nanostructure material formation. The model begins with the atomic/molecular interactions for the origin of nucleation by using parallel molecular dynamics (MD), and considers the mechanisms of nano-scale crystallization, nano-particle/crystal formation and growth. The researchers employ thermal dynamics and the equilibrium theory to account for the microscopic liquid-state precipitation and/or segregation, local thermal and special non-equilibriums, microstructure transition, particles and interactions, and phase change. They also consider the macroscopic transport phenomena and various defects at a macroscopic level. The computational infrastructure model fully lies in the large-scale parallel computing technologies bred by national cyber-infrastructure.

197,"This project addresses one of the fundamental problems in distributed computing: the ability to compute on sensitive or private data in a secure manner.  This is critically important for multi-institution and cross-disciplinary sharing and analysis of data, particularly in health-related fields and the social sciences.  This project builds upon and enhances several cyberinfrastructure elements which have been developed through other NSF awards and are already part of the existing research base.  By developing methods for securely sharing private data in different collaborative settings, ImPACT (Infrastructure for Privacy-Assured CompuTations) lowers the barriers to using privacy-restricted data in scientific collaborations. It reduces the time to discovery and opens new avenues for research.

ImPACT enables a variety of research scenarios that require integration of data across subdomains where relevant data sets are held by different stakeholders. The goal of ImPACT is to enable cooperative processing across the stakeholder-owned datasets, while respecting the privacy policies of the individual owners, and to provide a model for collaboration that could be readily used by other institutions.  The project brings together a team that includes social science researchers, cyber-infrastructure experts, and distributed systems and security experts from the University of North Carolina, Duke University, and Indiana University. A non-profit organization formed by the city of Durham, NC provides some of the data sets that are used in the project. To enable end-to-end data flows, ImPACT builds upon prior investments by the NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure program at the Duke and UNC campuses, as well as the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) program to support straightforward transfers of data within the respective virtual infrastructures.  By supporting three different trust models between collaborators, the project develops diverse methodologies with best practices in networking, data management, security, and privacy preservation to accommodate a variety of collaborative scenarios.

198,"Title: CRII: SCH: Brain-Body Sensor Fusion: Merging Neuroimaging With Full-Body Motion Capture
PI: Kunal Mankodiya

This proposal is to establish a cyber infrastructure to detect and visualize the brain's activities while the human body is in motion, performing various limb movements. Any disturbance in the brain-body functional coupling affects one's ability to move efficiently, causing various movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease that is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 4 million worldwide. Acquiring deepened understanding of such movement disorders demands to study brain activity and body movements simultaneously. Due to technical constraints, traditional brain scanners such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) require the body to remain horizontal and motionless during scanning periods. Moreover, fMRI is bulky and immobile, providing one image per second, while the brain's activity occurs at a much faster rate. Hence, there is a limited knowledge of brain dynamics that are coupled tightly to body's mobility behaviors. In recent years, ""functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)"" is emerging as a portable, optical neuroimaging device that provide greater benefits compared to the bulky counterparts such as fMRI. The PI takes the fNIRS technology one step further by integrating it with the maturing technology of body sensor networks (BSN) to quantify brain-body connectivity. 

The project aims to establish a medical cyber-physical system (mCPS) delivering the system integration of fNIRS and BSN. Specifically, the project mainly explores the following directions: System Integration: The mCPS is a system integration aggregating two complex subsystems (20-channel fNIRS system and 17-sensor body motion suit) to produce a unique interface delivering the overarching functionality of motion-tagged neuroimaging. Challenges in this project emerge from the heterogeneity of system components and interactions among them. In this work, system integration takes place into three forms: 1) ""hardware integration"" for centralizing the multimodal sensor data, 2) ""data integration/fusion"" for conditioning and fusing multi-dimensional task-level signals, and 3) ""presentation integration"" for combined visualization of brain and body behaviors. Motion-Tolerant Neuroimaging: It is expected that fNIRS neuroimaging data will face challenges of motion artifacts. Brain activity data would largely be superimposed by the mechanical vibrations traversed to the scalp due to the body movements. The PI explores harmonic sum models to rectify motion-affected brain activities to extract the more accurate hemodynamic response of the brain in mobile settings. A Clinical Screening Interface for Neurologists: The PI collaborates with a neurologist specialized in treating Parkinson's disease. The end result will be a clinical tool for physicians to screen the motor exams of patient with Parkinson's disease. The clinical tool is aimed at providing quantified data of motion and brain's cortical activities displayed side-by-side for the improved diagnostic screening of Parkinson's disease.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND,RESEARCH OFFICE,KINGSTON,US,Kingston,RI02,University of Rhode Island,RI,028811967,47.070,,05/16/2016,144017188,174999,05/31/2018,4900,Smart and Connected Health,174999,1565962,075705780,Kunal  Mankodiya,4 East Alumni Road,Kingston,US,Kingston,RI02,University of Rhode Island,RI,028811967,kunalm@uri.edu,Kunal,Mankodiya,,4018745138,wnilsen@nsf.gov,Wendy Nilsen,7032928930,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Brain Body Sensor Fusion was a 2-year project supported by NSF CISE Research Initiation Initiative. This project was conducted at the University of Rhode Island. The overall objective was to establish a cyber infrastructure to simultaneously collect the multi-channel data from a portable brain monitor and a full-body motion capture system. The project was aimed to assist the interventions of Parkinson?s Disease. 


The project outcomes are summarized in three parts: 
1) Integration of Brain and Body Monitoring Systems: We developed, validated, and experimented a data acquisition system that could collect multi-channel sensor signals from commercial devices - functional near infrared spectroscopy brain monitor and inertia-based full-body motion capture system. The data acquisition system was designed after a thorough investigation in the area of system integration and software engineering. The latest software is a one-click interface taking care of connecting, initializing, and gathering the data from two complex systems. 


2) Integration of Brain and Body Data: When the data from two systems are centralized and stored, they need to be analyzed for the measurement of how the body and brain are synchronized. The data arriving from both systems are inconsistent because the sensors are sampled at a different speed. We designed signal processing algorithms to synchronize the data.  


3) Visualization of Brain-Body Data: We also developed a visualization interface presenting the data from brain and body simultaneously side-by-side. This interface designed using graphics and animation software is helpful for neuroscientists who study movement disorders and are interested in learning about brain-body synchrony. 


The project also involved a data collection study from human participants including healthy individuals and Parkinson?s patients. The preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the data acquisition system could show differences in brain-body synchrony between Parkinson's patients and healthy individuals. In-depth analysis of the study data is underway.

200,"The overall goal of the project is the design and prototype implementation of a multi-cloud computing framework that seamlessly integrates community observations, remote sensing measurements, and advanced multimedia analytics for effective environmental monitoring. This infrastructure, called Meghdoot, will be employed for early detection of salt marsh stress in coastal areas and cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms in inland waters. This framework will harness multiple clouds including community clouds, sensor clouds, and computational clouds to develop efficient and timely event detection strategies. In addition, efficacious mechanisms for motivating and enabling community members to contribute high-quality content for enhanced environmental monitoring will be investigated. The first research thrust of the proposed project is to invent mechanisms to effectively leverage community clouds for monitoring lakes and salt marshes. In this community-as-sensors paradigm, data produced by individuals of the community (i.e., blogs, images, tweets) in online social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, etc.) will be used to generate trustworthy, actionable information. This, in turn, will act as the initial trigger for activating the traditional sensing infrastructure. The data from sensor clouds comprised of high resolution cameras and hyperspectral radiometers will be processed through the computational cloud using specialized techniques such as segmentation, feature extraction, registration, indexing, and spectral models for producing estimates of the cyanobacteria concentration and marsh biophysical characteristics from the study sites.  The final research thrust of this project will focus on the optimization of the deployment and operation of the sensor cloud based on the information from the community cloud and the results from the computational cloud.

This project addresses two environmental issues important to coastal states in southeastern United States, namely, harmful algal blooms and marsh browning events. Over the last decade the frequency and magnitude of these environmentally detrimental events have gone up primarily because of drought as well as sea level rise. Therefore, accurate, cost-effective, and targeted monitoring of these events is indispensable to sustainable management of the environment.  The proposed cyber-infrastructure-based warning system will enable early detection and timely implementation of preemptive measures to reduce the frequency and severity of future events while ensuring environmental conservation and sustainability.  The project plans to engage students, community leaders, resource managers, and the general public via training, workshops, and social media in various aspects of the research starting from crowd sourcing to environmental sensor deployments, data acquisition, processing, and interpretation.

201,"ABSTRACT
Our nation's practices in managing the growing amounts of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) that are generated every year are unsustainable. The majority of MSW generated every year is still disposed of in landfills despite national and international efforts aimed to increase recycling. In modern landfills, MSW is treated as a material to be isolated and contained. Current MSW management strategies cause sub-optimal degradation of landfill waste resulting in the generation of biogases (primarily methane and carbon dioxide) that are mostly flared, vented or leaked to the atmosphere where they remain as greenhouse gases (GHG). As a result, landfills represent the second largest anthropogenic source of methane in the US. Fortunately, MSW has high energy potential that remains virtually untapped as a national energy resource. The overarching goal of this research is to revolutionize how MSW is managed to provide a transformative means of extracting utility-scale energy from waste using next-generation facilities to be termed Sustainable Energy Reactor Facilities (SERFs). This paradigm-shift is only recently possible through the adoption of innovative computing technologies such as high-performance computing for multi-domain process modeling, low-cost autonomous sensor networks, and unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs), all synergistically integrated within a customized cyber-environment.  This integration of in-situ SERF observation with high-performance computing allows the energy generation capacity of SERF to be maximized resulting in lower cost energy production with a dramatic reduction in GHG and carbon footprint compared to traditional dry-tomb landfills. 

SERFs will be designed with two objectives: maximize energy recovery and minimize environmental impact. The explicit objective of maximizing energy generation will necessitate a significant deviation from modern MSW management practices which are based on empirical methods.  SERFs are only possible through environmental sensing and modeling of physical-chemical-biological processes occurring within a landfill. At the core of the SERF technology will be complex, multi-domain computational performance models (CPMs) that require execution in near real-time and consider these processes over varying spatial and temporal scales. CPM is enabled by high-performance computing platforms that can update and execute the CPMs using in-situ observations of MSW processes collected by field deployed wireless sensor networks. Model uncertainty can be further reduced through the introduction of ground-based and aerial mobile sensing platforms whose paths are optimally planned using CPM model uncertainty and platform constraints (e.g., energy) within the same minimizing objective function. With CPM models updated, energy generation can be predicted by SERF owners with energy extraction maximized by the injection of septage and leachate into the SERF. A multidisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in landfill design and modeling and researchers from computer science will work in close collaboration with an Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) of major waste industry stakeholders (i.e., waste management companies, industry consultants, and government regulators). Research, educational and outreach activities are integrated through a virtual ""hub"". The IAB will provide guidance on decisions pertaining to the project's research and education activities. Activities are planned to promote education of the society-at large, integrate undergraduate and graduate education and research, and nurture a well-equipped future domestic workforce to manage and advance SERF technology. An award-winning journalist will also be engaged in training engineering students in efficiently communicating with broad audiences complex engineering matters, and in evaluating the proposed web-based resources (videos and animations). In addition, the research team will partner with a team of Chinese researchers leading to international technology, education and cultural exchanges.",NSF,4900,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3003 South State St. Room 1062,Ann Arbor,US,Ann Arbor,MI12,University of Michigan Ann Arbor,MI,481091274,47.070,"['Jerome P Lynch', 'Edwin  Olson']",08/06/2014,073133571,1199600,08/31/2019,4900,CyberSEES,1199600,1442773,073133571,Dimitrios  Zekkos,2350 Hayward Street,Ann Arbor,US,Ann Arbor,MI12,University of Michigan Ann Arbor,MI,481092125,zekkos@umich.edu,Dimitrios,Zekkos,,7346471843,bhamilto@nsf.gov,Bruce K.

202,"This award provides partial support for a workshop to bring together a diverse group of community experts from academia, government, and industry to explore the integration of major Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) activities in various universities across the nation and to learn about important ongoing MGI research through plenary speakers and posters on major MGI-related themes. The Materials Genome Initiative is a multi-agency initiative designed to create a new era of policy, resources, and infrastructure that support U.S. institutions in the effort to discover, manufacture, and deploy advanced materials twice as fast, at a fraction of the cost. Ideas developed during the workshop will provide the foundation to develop a roadmap for integrating MGI activities. This will advance the science and engineering of materials. Since advanced materials are essential to economic security and human well-being, this workshop contributes more broadly to the needs of society. 

This workshop contributes to building a network to integrate ongoing and future activities associated with the MGI. The workshop will be held June 5-6, 2014 at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia. The MGI has launched a broad discussion among industry, government and university stakeholders on digital data, computation, and experiments necessary to accelerate the discovery and development of materials and their incorporation into products. The stated MGI goal is to speed up the process from discovery to deployment, in ""half the time at half the cost."" However, efforts to achieve this goal are often localized in specific institutions leading to major challenges in integrating efforts to achieve synergies, employ best practices, and avoid duplication. Related to these challenges, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, in conjunction with the 2nd anniversary of the MGI, announced in June 2013 an initiative organized jointly by Georgia Tech, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the University of Michigan to begin a national dialogue regarding prospects for establishing a national scale ""Accelerator Network"" for materials discovery, development, and deployment. Such an Accelerator Network would support MGI goals of significantly reducing the timeframe required to discover, develop, and deploy materials through collaborative efforts among industry, government, and university stakeholders. The merit of this activity lies in its potential to lead to more efficient and effective incorporation of scientific and engineering advances from institutions across the nation leading into the community leading to more rapid progress on the effort to decrease the time from the discovery of a material to its deployment in products.",NSF,4900,GEORGIA TECH RESEARCH CORPORATION,Office of Sponsored Programs,Atlanta,US,Atlanta,GA05,Georgia Tech Research Corporation,GA,303320420,47.049,,05/20/2014,097394084,15001,05/31/2015,4900,CONDENSED MATTER & MAT THEORY,15001,1444032,097394084,David L McDowell,225 North Avenue,Atlanta,US,Atlanta,GA05,Georgia Institute of Technology,GA,303320002,david.mcdowell@me.gatech.edu,David,McDowell,L,4048945128,dhess@nsf.gov,Daryl W.

Title:	EPSCoR 2030 Workshop

Institution:	West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission


This project seeks to conduct a workshop with representatives from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the EPSCoR  community, and recognized leaders of industrial and legislative bodies from both EPSCoR and non-EPSCoR jurisdictions. This workshop, entitled EPSCoR 2030, will be a timely follow-up to the ?EPSCoR 2020: Expanding State Participation in Research in the 21st Century ? A New Vision for EPSCoR? workshop held in 2006 and seeks to review progress on recommendations from EPSCoR 2020 and make needed adjustments. In addition, EPSCoR 2030 seeks to continue the dialogue with NSF on a shared understanding of EPSCoR goals and metrics and the most effective actions to enhance research competitiveness nationally. 


Intellectual Merit: The EPSCoR 2030 Workshop will provide NSF senior management with recommendations for increasing the quality and broadening the scope of research in EPSCoR jurisdictions, for more effectively developing and utilizing their science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) talent over the next decade, and for better targeting available funding to those jurisdictions for which the EPSCoR program can provide the largest incremental benefit to their research infrastructure. 

Broader Impacts:  Recommendations from the workshop are expected to prompt sustainable improvements in physical, human, and cyber infrastructure with EPSCoR jurisdictions as well as broader collaborative activities leading to collective solutions to challengers of regional and national importance.",NSF,4900,WEST VIRGINIA HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY COMMISSION,1018 Kanawha Blvd East Suite 700,Charleston,US,Charleston,WV02,Higher Education Policy Commission,WV,253012841,47.083,,09/09/2011,928636323,99684,08/31/2012,4900,EPSCoR Outreach and Workshops,99684,1155975,068126721,Paul L Hill,,,US,Charleston,WV02,Higher Education Policy Commission,WV,253012841,paul.hill@wvresearch.org,Paul,Hill,L,3045584128,dbarnes@nsf.gov,Denise M.

The two-day workshop produced observations about the value of the NSF program and recommended programmatic changes to be made both by NSF and by the EPSCoR states that can enhance EPSCoRÆs effectiveness.

EPSCoR statesÆ universities and colleges and their research faculty play a key role in U.S. economic competiveness. 
The NSF EPSCoR program has been highly successful in building research competitiveness. However, much more needs to be done to secure the programÆs future success. 
The vast majority of NSFÆs S&amp;T investment goes to a small number of non-EPSCoR states and institutions.
NSF EPSCoR needs to become more adaptive in order to improve strategic planning and to take advantage of new collaborative research opportunities in areas across states where EPSCoR has built strength relevant to S&amp;T opportunities emerging at the national and international levels.
The 31 EPSCoR jurisdictions in this unique federal-state partnership offer NSF an incredible ""test bed"" for its new initiatives. 
EPSCoR is a unique program at NSF. It is not a research program in and of itself, but a capacity building program that was designed to have an impact on research infrastructure across institutions and states.

EPSCoR research universities are a vital resource      that can and must be employed as the United States tackles S&amp;T issues      impacting the ability of the country to compete in high-tech global      markets. 
There are challenges where EPSCoR institutions have      the experience that can help NSF and the nation including energy, climate      variation, health, defense and homeland security and cyberinfrastructure.
While the NSF EPSCoR investment has fueled      incredible advancements in building research infrastructure, both NSF and      the EPSCoR states need to better articulate the need for and      achievementsof the NSF (and federal-wide) EPSCoR and IDeA efforts.
One of EPSCoRÆs strengths is that state committees,      universities and faculty are committed to scientific and engineering      excellence.
EPSCoRÆs current award mechanisms could be modified      to better reflect new NSF priorities, reduce the emphasis on funding      multiple activities with a single award, focus funding on achieving      critical needs in science and infrastructure and allow groups of EPSCoR      researchers to better pool the expertise which EPSCoR already has      developed in areas like water, energy, and cyberinfrastructure.


 

Recommendations include:

Since NSF EPSCoR research is critical to the      nationÆs science and technology policy, NSF must continue to expand its      EPSCoR funding and overall support in order to guarantee this programÆs      relevance.
NSF EPSCoR should return to its original focus of      increasing research capacity.
NSF should use EPSCoR states and their research      institutions as a test bed for new agency initiatives taking advantage of      their size, diversity and nimble structures.
NSF and EPSCoR institutions must act now to develop      a robust cyberinfrastructure to ensure that faculties are, and remain,      competitive.
The ""EPSCoR success story"" must be better told in      the national interest.

204,"This proposal brings together urban planners and environmental scientists, experts in complexity modeling and spatial analyses for science and policy applications, learning scientists studying how technology enhances cognitive and decision-making processes, and computer scientists concerned with visualizations and visual analytics. The aim is to enhance existing visualization tools and the social processes in which they are embedded to better support participatory planning addressing complex environmental problems. 

The complexity of such problems makes it hard to trace causal impacts through the web of interactions, including the effects of individual decisions on the quality of shared natural resources. While visualization tools have been designed to assist stakeholders to plan for these problems, they are usually very elaborate, requiring trained facilitators to manage their inputs and interpret their outputs. Similarly, an increasing amount of relevant sensor and simulation data exists, but in a form that is not accessible or usable for this community. As a result, stakeholders are insulated from the very information they need for their decisions, basing them instead on invalid knowledge and unexamined assumptions. This study will allow us to design tools that bring forward the spatial relationships and interactions that are hidden in the complexity of environmental problems, yet making them accessible to stakeholders for routine use in the planning decisions shaping the environmental future of places across the U.S. 

To achieve these aims this team is working with existing agent-based modeling and geographic information systems software, applying Design-Based Research and Participatory Design methods to create software and evolve the collaborative learning structures needed for its use in this context. They are distilling stakeholder needs and preferences to propose and test alternate user interfaces to support stakeholders? input of specialized knowledge and values, interpretation of outputs, and collaborative use of the tools in the social context of participatory planning. They are also exploring ways to capitalize on the data- and opinion-sharing potential of social networking technology to enhance stakeholders? collective learning and planning with these tools. Engaging actual stakeholders in the design process thus greatly increases the chance that the software and learning structures will be ultimately adopted by the target demographic upon deployment. A by-product of this research includes the assessment materials to examine how each one of these tools supports different aspects of visual thinking about complex environmental problems, and how they inform planning judgments to address them. This is of interest to researchers evaluating similar processes. Approaching environmental issues from across these fields provides the appropriate scope for creating infrastructure for the public and for planning practitioners in a way formerly limited to specialists. 

Broader Impacts 
The main goal is to train citizens with the ability to engage in spatial and complex systems conceptualization of the environmental issues they face, and empower them to chart their own future with a fuller understanding of the impacts of their decisions. By definition, participatory planning seeks different voices to be heard in defining a problem and in suggesting solutions. This work is developing guidelines for effective participatory visualization software and learning activities so that stakeholders are active constructors and engaged users of the tools needed for critical deliberation around complex environmental problems. By empowering diverse representatives to take part in the production of relevant information and recommendations, the project aims to counteract the power imbalances that tend to plague policy and plan making, where only a few have access to key information. A second goal is to develop the curricular and pedagogical materials to train Computer Science students to create effective visualization software and interfaces for this purpose, and Urban Planning students to conduct participatory processes with these tools. A future implementation stage will build on this work to deploy the software, accompanying social practices and supporting cyber-infrastructure in other stakeholder communities dealing with a variety of complex environmental problems, and to incorporate the training modules in the Urban Planning and Computer Science curricula at UIC, which serves one of the most diverse student bodies in the US",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS,809 S MARSHFIELD,Chicago,US,Chicago,IL07,University of Illinois at Chicago,IL,606124305,47.070,"['Andrew E Johnson', 'Joshua  Radinsky', 'Leilah B Lyons', 'Charles  Hoch']",08/19/2011,098987217,249953,12/31/2016,4900,CI-TEAM,265953,1135572,041544081,Moira  Zellner,"412 S.

We examined how complex systems visualization techniques, custom user interfaces, and facilitation designs helped stakeholders comprehend and respond to environmental complexity, and how what they learned informed planning deliberations. Throughout the life of this project, we:

-Developed groundwater and flooding models for participatory modeling that employ visualizations of ongoing complex processes

-Developed custom mobile and tangible user interfaces and supportive facilitation structures to enable stakeholders to jointly explore the complex problem, design and test possible solutions, and seek compromises to resolve the tradeoffs of specific solutions.

-Developed a learning assessment methodology to examine how stakeholders individually and collectively learn and plan with different visualization tools.

-Conducted multiple lab and in-situ studies to test and refine our models, interfaces and facilitation guidelines.

-Strengthened existing relationships and established new ones with external partners (NGOs and local, regional, state, and federal governmental agencies in the US and abroad) interested in adopting the participatory modeling approach in their professional practice.

We found that:

-Engaging in complex systems modeling helped participants shift from a local to a regional perspective and understanding of interactions, and propose novel policy ideas to address flooding and water supply.

-An interactional setting supporting hands-on tactile manipulation of tangible interface elements expanded the range of collaborative exploration and stimulated the consideration of novel solutions, more so than relying on digital mouse clicks and discussion in a more instructional setting. Our iPad applications complemented the tangible interfaces, allowing users to focus on participants' variables of interest. Our final activity protocol supports participants as they reason spatially about the dynamics of water flow through the landscape, and reason critically about the possible impacts of solutions and the identification and discussion of important tradeoffs, based on an enhanced understanding of spatial interactions between water, infrastructure and land cover, and of the diversity of values among stakeholders.

Our work contributes to planning, computer science and learning sciences theories and practice by:

-Providing evidence of productive collaborative exploration of complex problem spaces, innovation of solutions, and compromise-seeking behavior around solutions with visualization tools that make the complexity of biophysical processes and community values transparent and visible.

-Distilling specifications for the design of modeling tools and interfaces to enhance the public's access to complex systems simulations, and thus support policy-making with scientific understanding.

-Developing a methodology to assess social learning processes using visualization tools in planning settings, and a data mining method to identify productive component strategies in an open-ended spatial reasoning problem space.

The broader impacts of our work include:

-Generating interest in a variety of communities, including professionals who want to adopt the tools we have developed in their planning practice, and modelers who want to ensure the broader stakeholder use of the tools they develop.

-Strengthening interdisciplinary collaboration among disparate fields (hydrology, planning, spatial modeling and analysis, complex systems, learning sciences, computer science) to address complex environmental problems.

-Interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students, who gained skills in management, and design and development of models, interfaces, facilitation structures, and assessments. Assistants participated in lab and in-situ trials, learning how to set up, conduct and evaluate such workshops. Assistants were also actively involved in manuscript writing and publication, serving as co-authors in many publications.

-Numerous scholarly publications and academic and community presentations, two dissertations, and a patent application.

-Inclusion of the literature produced and insights gained from the project into UIC planning and computer science curricula.

Our ultimate goal is to enhance environmental planning and policy-making with better tools for decision makers and more effective ways they can use them. Our protocol has already influenced the design of green infrastructure solutions to flooding. Some workshops produced innovative solutions through interaction with our tools, and plans have been adapted based on what participants learned during our workshops, effectively integrating science (represented in the flooding simulation) and democracy (represented in the visualization and valuation of diverse interests of stakeholders) to inform policy. Our next step is to scale up our work: external partners and stakeholder representatives in the region have expressed a need for these tools and their willingness to try them in their communities, encouraging us to pursue commercialization of our product. In addition, our work has attracted the attention of communities of socio-ecological modelers, who see increasing value of enhancing the stakeholder and decision-maker access to and use of modeling tools developed by these communities, and are including such considerations in current work agendas and fundraising efforts. Further funding will allow us to deploy pilot exercises, keep refining our protocol, and developing it for widespread use in planning and policy-making for a range of complex environmental problems.

205,"Activities undertaken in the SESv3 Federated Security Intelligence project will develop significant new capabilities supporting the collection and sharing of cybersecurity threat data and intelligence, and a rich analytic knowledge of the reputation and forensic history of Internet elements. Work will be based on the existing open source REN-ISAC Security Event System (SES) and sister system, the Collective Intelligence Framework (CIF). Developed capabilities will be transitioned to operational practice in the REN-ISAC community, supporting security protection and response in the higher education and research communities, and will support the sharing of security event and incident intelligence among other discrete trust federations.

In 2008-9, REN-ISAC developed SESv1 with funding from the US Department of Justice through Internet2. A production service in the REN-ISAC community, SESv1 collects aggregated security event information from participating sites and information sharing partners, correlates the data to develop confidence in the identification of bad actors, and provides resulting high-confidence threat intelligence back to participating sites for use in local protections. SESv2, to be deployed summer 2011, advances SES with the addition of the ""Collective Intelligence Framework"". CIF integrates a vast array of data from private partners, public sources, and mining, to provide intelligence supporting reputational knowledge and forensic history of Internet elements, including IP address, URL, domain name, CIDR, AS, and email addresses.

SDCI Sec: SESv3 will substantially increase the reputational knowledgebase and forensic history by incorporating additional data types, such as BGP and passive DNS. These data types will permit analytic identification of miscreant cyber infrastructures. Free form data types such as e-mail, IRC, tweets, etc. will be incorporated to enrich threat understanding by correlating human conversations with the structured security event information. The underlying repository and system architectures will be redesigned in order to support massive scaling required by the additional data types and historical record. Leveraging the flexible SES/CIF v2 RESTful API, access and submission to SES and CIF will be incorporated into common incident analyst and responder tools. And importantly, methods will be implemented permitting unique and discrete information sharing trust communities to share event and incident intelligence, mediated by policy. SESv3 will be transitioned to operational status in the REN-ISAC community, providing direct support to the higher education and research communities, will be open source published, and the SESv3 team will continue with their strong advocacy for standards-based security information interchange, and SES/CIF technologies in the security community at-large.

Intellectual Merit: SDCI Sec: SESv3 will lead development and deployment of inter-community security event and incident information sharing (addressing technical and policy issues), will significantly reduce human interrupt in the discovery, analysis, and protect cycle, and will develop advanced correlations among threat data types. SESv3 will provide novel integration of federation-based intelligence and data collection into the workflow of the security incident responder and analyst, and novel correlation of human conversations to structured data regarding Internet elements.

Broader Impact: SDCI Sec: SESv3 will provide fundamental improvement to national and international capabilities concerning the protection of critical cyberinfrastructure. Intelligence developed and shared in SES is actionable, and is a resource for understanding threat and criminal operations. Advanced new capabilities and information sharing relationships with industry, government, and law enforcement will be established in REN-ISAC, supporting the research and education sector. Outside R&E, national capabilities and information sharing practice will be stimulated by SESv3 concepts, open source code, data standards advocacy, and the technical and policy information sharing frameworks.",NSF,4900,TRUSTEES OF INDIANA UNIVERSITY,509 E 3RD ST,Bloomington,US,Bloomington,IN09,Indiana University,IN,474013654,47.070,['Minaxi  Gupta'],08/03/2011,006046700,799322,05/31/2015,4900,Cyber Secur - Cyberinfrastruc,799322,1127425,006046700,Douglas D Pearson,P.O.

This project built upon the existing Security Event System (SES) project [1] within the research and higher education (R&amp;E) security community. In a community such as REN-ISAC [2], guided by policy and information sharing agreements, machine and human derived security event data are normalized, and through secure interfaces, submitted to the SES repository to be shared with participants in an automated fashion.
In REN-ISAC SES, data is received from participating REN-ISAC members, information sharing relationships that REN-ISAC has established with other organizations, and public data sources. Submission parameters, correlation, and data augmentation identify ""bad actors"" and determine confidence. High confidence bad actor data is formed into ""watch for these"" and ""block these"" feeds. Participating sites retrieve the feeds and apply local protections against the bad actors in such things as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and domain name system sinkholes. Additionally, via Web and application programming interface, participating analysts interact with the data for intelligence supporting incident response processes.
Early versions of SES reduced the overhead involved in sharing and using threat intelligence by focusing on machine-to-machine interaction over human-mediated interaction. The goal of the ongoing SES project is rapid collection and deployment of high-confidence threat indicators into security systems, providing timely protection, aiding incident response, and supporting analytic discovery and knowledge of criminal cyber infrastructure. SESv3 dramatically improves the capabilities to receive, store, process, access, and share threat intelligence; SESv3 incorporates new data types supporting threat analysis; and, the system architecture and development methodology supports rapid deployment of new features and enhancements.
The NSF award for SESv3 enabled scaling and supporting the work in a way that enlisted support of the broad international Computer Security Incident Response Team (æCSIRTÆ) community in addition to our home research and education (R&amp;E) community. With this, we were able to incorporate valuable feedback concerning features, approaches, and priorities from many sectors, such as Telecommunications, Finance, and Government, in addition to our 400+ member R&amp;E community.
By conducting the work as a professionally-managed open-source project, used in production, we were able to grow our user and interest community from a few dozen to over 500 external participants in a few years. In doing so, we produced two major releases of the software, including over 20 alpha and beta releases, pioneering intelligence sharing concepts. The outcome is a tool that enables CSIRTs to consume and share threat intelligence in real-time; and importantly, an outcome is the ability to sustain and scale ongoing development in a way that meets the demands of a large, open-source project. By opening up the project from the beginning we tapped into a large pool of user, developer, and analyst contributions. By employing an efficient development-to-release pipeline we quickly moved from idea, through testing and quality assurance, to production. The result was a more stable and useful piece of technology that was battle tested and solved real world problems as it was being built.
This NSF funding enabled us to develop a framework for other open-source security projects, not just in how they should operate, but in ways conducive for long term sustainability. Many projects focus on commercialization. Our focus was to develop a methodology around community-driven tool development for CSIRTs and security teams; while at the same time equipping them with a tool to share threat intelligence within their served community and with other trusted partners.

206,"The integrated Rule Oriented Data System (iRODS) software is used in production systems on an international scale, supporting interdisciplinary research projects in seismology, oceanography, astronomy, plant biology, climate change, cognitive science, social sciences, psycholinguistics, and high-energy physics. The iRODS data grid supports collections at scale, from small 200 Gigabyte social science collections, to multi-petabyte collections of observational data.

This will fund the development of the iRODS infrastructure to incorporate new capabilities to meet the requirements by each user community, to support interoperability with domain specific technologies such as support for an extended metadata system, advanced data transport protocols, unification of authentication environments, user-selected access mechanisms, data analytic micro-services, and real-time data streams.  This will also fund continued consulting support for installation and customization of the software, incorporation of new features developed by an international group of collaborators, and presentation of tutorials and workshops on applications of iRODS. We will develop rulekits that encapsulate standard policy and procedure sets to simplify use by new communities. We will collaborate with the University of Wisconsin on security appraisals to minimize vulnerabilities, and collaborate with the Renaissance Computing Institute on integration with cloud computing systems. We will explore research initiatives related to database federation and workflow integration to meet specific requirements of the user communities.

We will develop the mechanisms (improved user interfaces, documentation, and rulekits) that will enable use of the iRODS data grid at scale with thousands to millions of users. We will support the application of the iRODS infrastructure to NSF research initiatives with the explicit goal of enabling use of shared collections within institutional repositories for education initiatives. Since the policies used within iRODS to control collections can be tuned to meet specific community goals, iRODS can be used to integrate institutional repositories with NSF national research initiatives. iRODS can also link personal laptops into national collaborations, enabling policy-controlled participation by students in research initiatives.

With people pooling data, methods, computation and skills it is very important to develop a sustainable and extensible model for a  cyber-infrastructure platform that can be easily deployed and that can work across multiple disciplines to provide a uniform interface enabling long-term and short-term research collaborations. The integrated Rule Oriented Data System (iRODS) software, developed and deployed under this NSF funded project is  a model collaboration platform that is being used by large-scale scientific and bio-medical communities.

Research collaboration infrastructure relies on two important concepts: virtualization and federation. Virtualization provides a means of hiding differences in technologies and peculiarities of system requirements by exposing a uniform interface to the applications and users. For example, two autonomous systems can differ in the way they authenticate a user for access to their systems. But middleware can hide these differences and provide a uniform way to authenticate a user while acting as a proxy user to these two systems. Virtualization of the management of a set of resources for a  community of users gives rise to self-contained Virtual Organizations (VO). Federation mediates interactions across two or more VOs and manages the trust relationship between autonomous communities of users.

 We explored a particular type of virtual organization (VO), called the policy-oriented data management system and which led to the development of the iRODS software. In iRODS, namespaces for users, resources, metadata, methods, and micro-services are virtualized and form a means of abstracting technological differences in the physical implementation of the system. The user is exposed to a virtual framework which remains unchanged even as technology extension, versioning, obsolescence and refresh is happening under the covers. The stability provided by such a system makes it easier for scientists to concentrate on Science rather than dealing with the ever changing technology. We also explored models of federation across VOs &ndash; across homogenous systems and heterogeneous systems. Two models of federation &ndash; strong federation and weak federation - were established and developed as part of the iRODS software infrastructure. The two models provide deployment at different levels of trusted interactions between two autonomously managed resources and VOs.

Multiple versions of the iRODS system software were successfully released by the project team. Sound software engineering practices were adopted in developing iRODS including repeated in-depth vulnerability assessments, resulting in a highly secure community software.   More than a thousand projects all around the world are using iRODS for implementing their virtual data organizations. These include major NSF-funded projects such as the iPlant Collaborative Data Store, the XSEDE Data Replication Service, the Southern California Earthquake Simulation data management, PetaShare Data Network, the GENI project and the Data Federation Consortium Platform. Other projects that use iRODS range from federal agencies such as NASA, NOAO, and NOAA data grids, and commercial enterprises such as the Sanger Institute, the Broad Institute and Data Direct Networks.  Other regional, institutional and national projects include the SILS Life Time Library, the Texas Digital Library, CineGrid, Chronopolis, French National Library, Taiwan National Archive and the Australian Research Collaboration Service.

The iRODS system developed with NSF funding, enjoys a large user base and plays a critical role in national-scale projects and enterprises. Hence, transitioning the software into a sustainable environment was critical so that commitments made to these projects will be kept and the funding put forth by NSF in promoting this effort will continue to have a major impact into the futu...",,"['Rajasekar, A., H.

207,"Widely deployed for military and civilian applications, sensor networks have become an indispensable segment of national cyber infrastructure. In sensor networks, sensor nodes sense continuously and generate data to describe the environment; once data have been generated, an essential mission of the network is to manage sensor data such that useful data are stored safely and authorized users can have access to data of their interest. Meanwhile, sensor nodes are usually deployed in unattended even hostile environments, and they typically lack tamper resistance. As such, sensor data management is susceptible to various security attacks. Although a few schemes have been proposed against selected attacks, the limitations are also salient: lacking protection for emerging sensor data management approaches, disrupting normal data management operations, high overhead, lack of adaptability to balance security level and system overhead, and no systematic solutions to counter multiple types of attacks at the same time. To address these issues, this project is to design an integrated solution to provide novel privacy, confidentiality, integrity and reliability protection for sensor data management. It includes four components: location privacy protection, data confidentiality protection, data integrity protection and data reliability protection. These components will be integrated together via a carefully-designed hierarchical and modular software structure, and to be evaluated through a combination of model checking, simulation, and implementation on a sensor network testbed. The project will contribute to the development of innovative solutions for protecting sensor networks, training of a diverse cadre of young scientists, students and professionals in wireless

208,"This CI-Team demonstration will create a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary, engineering model to support in-silico prototyping of snake-inspired robotic systems.  Snake-inspired robots have many potential applications, including those in medicine, civil engineering, search and rescue, and homeland security.  This model will be created during a coordinated set of multi-disciplinary classes developed by the PIs and concurrently taught across the partner institutions and accessible via distance learning systems.  The CI-Team plans an ambitious use of cyber-collaboration and education technologies to prototype a set of core courses in a curriculum for ""Engineering Informatics"" that spans our institutions and unites computer and information sciences with traditional engineering domains.

The team is a highly inter-disciplinary group from four universities consisting of computer scientists and engineers with the complimentary expertise needed to create both the shared model and the educational deliverables.  The scientific challenge to the team is to produce an engineering model that integrates semantic descriptions of robotic components, behavioral and simulation software, software for snake robot control and navigation, as well as the tools needed to perform analysis, component surrogation and mission assessment.  The educational challenge is to develop course materials that are both multi-disciplinary and scientifically rich.  The goal is to educate students so they can span and integrate disciplines: semantics, engineering modeling, and computational tools.  This project will deeply connect different sub-fields of engineering and computer science, enabling the new inter-disciplinary trained engineers to rapidly create new snake-inspired robot designs. 

BROADER IMPACTS: This project contributes to the transformation of engineering into an ""informatics"" discipline and broadens the interface between computer science and engineering.  The CI-Team aims to establish the content of an ""Engineering Informatics"" curriculum around the snake robot domain and use it as a basis for integrating fundamental concepts from engineering and computer science.  Further, the technical results contained in the engineering model will support two areas of major national need.  First, it advances the state of the art in snake-inspired robotic systems and produces a repository for use by educators and researchers.  Second, through active collaboration with partners at NIST and DOE, the team will transition concepts into ongoing standards efforts sponsored by ISO and the W3C. Finally, the development of the Engineering Informatics discipline will contribute to a cyberinfrastructure-savvy workforce and by integrating the results of this demonstration project with on-going efforts for broadened participation will also create a diverse cyberinfrastructure workforce and user community.",NSF,4900,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,"1505 Race St, 10th Floor",Philadelphia,US,Philadelphia,PA02,Drexel University,PA,191021119,47.070,"['Ming C Lin', 'Vadim  Shapiro', 'Satyandra K Gupta', 'Michael  Piasecki']",09/12/2005,002604817,250000,12/31/2006,4900,CI-TEAM,250000,0537370,002604817,William C Regli,"1505 Race St, 10th Floor",Philadelphia,US,Philadelphia,PA02,Drexel University,PA,191021119,regli@umd.edu,William,Regli,C,3014056738,@nsf.gov,,,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,,09/15/2005,CI-TEAM: Exploiting Cyber-Infrastructure for Creation and Use of Multi-Disciplinary Engineering Models,Grant
209,"Advances in both hardware and software infrastructure are quickly making it possible to carry out realistic simulations of materials and materials phenomena that can lead to a better understanding of their behavior. Simulations constitute one of the key ingredients necessary to realize the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI), which calls for the reduction in time and resources necessary to develop the materials needed to enable potentially transformative technologies. To push the thriving field of Computational Materials Science (CMS) forward it is necessary to provide the next generation research workforce with a broad exposure to as many computational techniques as possible.  This project brings together researchers in materials science and engineering, and in advanced cyber-infrastructure (CI) to establish the Computational Materials Science Summer School (CMS3) that aims to train graduate students and junior scientists and engineers in some of the most advanced and widely used computational materials science simulation tools. The training provided by CMS3 will equip participating students with the knowledge and skills necessary to push the frontiers of simulation-enabled materials research. Furthermore, CMS3 will contribute to MGI's mission of maintaining the Nation's overall economic competitiveness and security by training the scientists and engineers that will discover and develop the materials that will make technologies of national importance possible.

This award leverages existing cyber-infrastructure to expand participation, including from underrepresented groups, through local and remote training. Expert instructors are selected from academic, domestic and international institutions, and national laboratories to cover three modules: continuum micromechanics, mesoscopic simulation and atomistic modeling, along with an overarching theme of data science. The school targets 20 on-site and up to 80 remote graduate and post-doctoral researchers, including industry participants. The activities of CMS3 are to (i) establish a CMS network among national laboratories and academic institutions to leverage the expertise of the CMS community at large in developing the next-generation workforce in materials research across multiple scales; (ii) develop a CMS curriculum, commensurate with a summer school format, that involves utilizing and supporting advanced CI for effective scale-up of a series of practica; (iii) organize shorter seed programs in specialized areas, such as dislocation dynamics, phase-field modeling and data-enabled materials science; (iv) integrate the theoretical foundations and practical training into the graduate curriculum and continuing education at Texas A&M University and elsewhere; and (v) introduce immersive visualization through virtual and augmented reality tools to help students with different backgrounds and learning styles interpret complex material data. Course material and software codes associated with this project not already disseminated by the original developers are maintained in a GitHub repository. This ensures that all released materials and packages are preserved to maintain historical context and broad access.

210,"Knowledge of a specific neural network supporting memory function in the human brain stems from the case of patient H.M. who, in 1953 underwent an experimental medial temporal lobectomy in the hope of reducing the frequency and severity of his epileptic seizures. The operation was successful in that respect, but it unexpectedly left him incapable of creating new memories. For more than five decades, H.M. participated in hundreds of experiments and his case was discussed in thousands of scientific publications. His brain contained the clues to understand how memory works; however, determining with precision which structures were damaged was not possible because even the latest neuroimaging could not clearly resolve the anatomy of the temporal lobes. With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Jacopo Annese will complete an 'open source', web-based microscopic atlas of H.M.'s brain which was donated to science post-mortem. The tools-embedded atlas will support the creation of teaching curricula that will expose students to raw neuroimaging data from multiple modalities, cutting edge brain mapping algorithms, web-based exploration tools, all within the clinical and biographical context of H.M. as an individual. The cyber infrastructure created through this project is expected to enable discovery neuroscience by participants world wide.  

Specifically, Dr. Annese and his research team will (1) provide a dedicated support infrastructure to maintain and manage the web atlas for H.M.'s brain; (2) significantly increase the accuracy of the atlas by increasing the number of digitized histological slices to achieve 1 mm per slice interval (from 3mm interval); (3) acquire and deliver image stacks to enable remote quantitative studies; (4) implement new web tools to enable the handling of remote request and curation of results from different laboratories; (5) convert the images into formats that can be 3-D printed using consumer products.   Such cyber infrastructure will make the valuable H.M. data available for new retrospective studies that may further change our current view of how memory is established in the human brain and enable quantitative analyses at the cellular level using a 'virtual microscope'.  The resulting atlas will be used by researchers worldwide to re-interpret, based on clear anatomical evidence, the results from hundreds of neuropsychological exams conducted when H.M. was alive.",NSF,4900,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,4400 UNIVERSITY DR,FAIRFAX,US,Fairfax,VA11,George Mason University,VA,220304422,47.075,,10/14/2016,077817450,300000,08/31/2017,4900,COGNEURO,300000,1663755,077817450,Jacopo  Annese,,Fairfax,US,Fairfax,VA11,George Mason University,VA,220304422,drjannese@gmail.com,Jacopo,Annese,,6194004901,uhasson@nsf.gov,Uri Hasson,7032927267,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"In the summer of 1953, a young epileptic named Henry G. Molaison underwent a novel type of lobotomy in the hope of reducing the frequency and severity of his convulsions. The operation was successful in reducing his seizures, but it unexpectedly left the patient incapable of creating new memories, a condition neuropsychologists calls: anterograde amnesia. Researchers quickly realized that memory depends on specific structures in the brain. From that point on, Henry Molaison became the most intensively studied individual in the history of medicine. For more than five decades, he contributed to thousands of scientific publications and hundreds of book chapters under the pseudonym, patient H.M.

 

H.M. died in December 2008, fifty-six years after the fateful surgery. Dr. Annese and his team at The Brain Observatory dissected his brain and created an archive of tissue slices and images hoping to find out the exact nature of the surgical lesion and to create a resource that would support further research on amnesia.  Now, all these data and images are available for exploration, research and teaching. Funding from the National Science Foundation supported an open-source, web-based platform that functions as a ?digital brain bank?, designed to promote collaboration and open the data to exploration. H.M.'s brain, once an invaluable but perishable wet specimen, is now immortalized into an indelible scientific and educational resource accessible to an unlimited number of researchers, scholars, and the curious world-wide.

211,"Minimizing the impact of human actions on wildlife is a priority for conservation biology.  Distributed motion-sensitive cameras, or camera traps, are popular tools for monitoring wildlife populations.  Recent work has shown that camera trap surveys can be expanded to large scales by crowdsourcing through citizen science, producing big data sets needed to evaluate the effect of sustainability strategies on wildlife populations.  However, these large-scale surveys create millions of photographs that create new challenges for data processing and quality control. 

This project seeks to develop advanced computing technologies for cloud-based large-scale data sensing, analysis, annotation, management, and preservation for wildlife and ecological sustainability to inform effective resource management, decision-making, and polices on human actions to protect wildlife and natural resources. Specifically, the project aims to: (1) explore a citizen scientist-based approach and system for large-scale sustainable data collection; (2) develop deep-learning based fine-grain animal species recognition from large data sets and automated content annotation; (3) study cloud-based computing with thin-client access and resource allocation for scalable deployment and easy access by citizen scientists; and (4) develop a comprehensive data annotation quality monitoring and control framework with tightly coupled computer annotation, crowd-sourcing, and expert review to ensure a high scientific standard of data quality. These tools will be integrated into the eMammal infrastructure to study three questions on wildlife sustainability: energy development, housing development, and wildlife harvest.  These tools will also be available to other wildlife researchers using the eMammal system, enabling an improved understanding how humans can live sustainably with wildlife. 

Collaborative wildlife monitoring and tracking at large geographical and time scales will contribute to the understanding of complex dynamics of wildlife systems, and provide important scientific evidence for informed decisions and effective solutions to sustainability issues in wildlife environments. This project will provide unique, exciting, and interdisciplinary opportunities for mentoring graduate students and involving K-12 and undergraduate students into professionally guided research.

Specifically, the project aims to: (1) explore a citizen scientist-based approach and system for large-scale sustainable data collection; (2) develop deep-learning based fine-grain animal species recognition from large data sets and automated content annotation; (3) study cloud-based computing with thin-client access and resource allocation for scalable deployment and easy access by citizen scientists; and (4) develop a comprehensive data annotation quality monitoring and control framework with tightly coupled computer annotation, crowd-sourcing, and expert review to ensure a high scientific standard of data quality. These tools will be integrated into the eMammal infrastructure to study three questions on wildlife sustainability: energy development, housing development, and wildlife harvest.  These tools will also be available to other wildlife researchers using the eMammal system, enabling an improved understanding how humans can live sustainably with wildlife. 

Collaborative wildlife monitoring and tracking at large geographical and time scales will contribute to the understanding of complex dynamics of wildlife systems, and provide important scientific evidence for informed decisions and effective solutions to sustainability issues in wildlife environments. This project will provide unique, exciting, and interdisciplinary opportunities for mentoring graduate students and involving K-12 and undergraduate students into professionally guided research.

213,"Knowledge of a specific neural network supporting memory function in the human brain stems from the case of patient H.M. who, in 1953 underwent an experimental medial temporal lobectomy in the hope of reducing the frequency and severity of his epileptic seizures. The operation was successful in that respect, but it unexpectedly left him incapable of creating new memories. For more than five decades, H.M. participated in hundreds of experiments and his case was discussed in thousands of scientific publications. His brain contained the clues to understand how memory works; however, determining with precision which structures were damaged was not possible because even the latest neuroimaging could not clearly resolve the anatomy of the temporal lobes. With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Jacopo Annese will complete an 'open source', web-based microscopic atlas of H.M.'s brain which was donated to science post-mortem. The tools-embedded atlas will support the creation of teaching curricula that will expose students to raw neuroimaging data from multiple modalities, cutting edge brain mapping algorithms, web-based exploration tools, all within the clinical and biographical context of H.M. as an individual. The cyber infrastructure created through this project is expected to enable discovery neuroscience by participants world wide.  

Specifically, Dr. Annese and his research team will (1) provide a dedicated support infrastructure to maintain and manage the web atlas for H.M.'s brain; (2) significantly increase the accuracy of the atlas by increasing the number of digitized histological slices to achieve 1 mm per slice interval (from 3mm interval); (3) acquire and deliver image stacks to enable remote quantitative studies; (4) implement new web tools to enable the handling of remote request and curation of results from different laboratories; (5) convert the images into formats that can be 3-D printed using consumer products.   Such cyber infrastructure will make the valuable H.M. data available for new retrospective studies that may further change our current view of how memory is established in the human brain and enable quantitative analyses at the cellular level using a 'virtual microscope'.

214,"Cities are the crucibles of civilization, and accelerating global urbanization raises challenges and opportunities related to density and scale in areas including transportation; food production and distribution; human health and wellbeing; education; social policy and services; and management of water and energy. Seeking to understand the human, social, and economic to help develop effective education or public policy scientists, and thus city officials, have traditionally been limited to qualitative studies or to using sparse, often stale data sources. The open data movement is making an increasingly rich set of urban data available, but the cyber infrastructure technologies and tools used to make this data available were designed primarily to support the analysis of individual data sets rather than exploring relationships among many data sets. Consequently, urban scientists from sociology, economics, behavioral sciences, education, engineering, operations research, and other disciplines lack the tools and infrastructure to fully harness urban data for their research. The questions these researchers ask are therefore constrained by the data they have in hand. Two new cyber infrastructure capabilities have potential to unleash these data sources, both exploiting the fact that most of the published urban data sets share the attributes of location and time. The first is to allow a scientist to assemble data from multiple, independent, data sources for a specific geographical location point (latitude/longitude), city unit (street segment, census tract, block), or area (polygon). The second is to select a window of time and to normalize the selected data sources using a common sampling interval, merging them into a composite structure for computational and statistical analysis. Taken together, these capabilities will allow a scientist to study urban areas, over specific time periods, with varied, relevant data represented as a time series of vectors. We propose to develop, in partnership with urban scientists and City officials initially from Chicago and eventually from New York City, a proof-of-concept with these capabilities.

The prototype will draw data from open data portals, allowing a researcher to specify a location, a window of time, a sampling period, and a list of data sets. The system will provide a matrix with one row per time sample and columns representing each data set. By merging and transforming urban data into matrices we will enable urban scientists to apply the tools of mathematics and computation to understand urban challenges ranging from youth violence and crime to graduate rates to employment and economic decline and revitalization.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, THE",5801 South Ellis Avenue,Chicago,US,Chicago,IL01,University of Chicago,IL,606375418,47.070,,09/05/2013,005421136,299998,09/30/2016,4900,DATANET,299998,1348865,005421136,Charles E Catlett,5735 S Ellis Ave,Chicago,US,Chicago,IL01,University of Chicago,IL,606371433,catlett@anl.gov,Charles,Catlett,E,6302527867,rchadduc@nsf.gov,Robert Chadduck,7032928970,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The goal of this project was to provide a prototype platform that (a) draws on open place-based data from many sources, (b) enables a person to discover what data is available associated with a selected geographic place or area, (c) specify a window of time and a sampling period for selected data associated with that place or area, (d) evaluate the general character (completeness, dynamics, geographic distribution/density, etc.) of the data, and (e) extract multiple selected data sets in a form that is aligned spatially and temporally to facilitate advanced data analysis.

The team worked with social scientists and data scientists from multiple universities as well as the City of Chicago to develop an open data discovery and exploration capability that could be used by non-data-scientists such as social or economic scientists or policy makers. 

The goal was to create a web-based open data resource for non-data scientists, with discovery, exploration, and integration capabilities in order to reduce the amount of work needed to find and combine data sets together before asking science questions.  This meant providing three fundamental capabilities:

(1) Discovery.  Open data is fragmented across many open data portals, which provide internal search but no global search capability exists across these silos. 

(2) Exploration.  We wanted to provide visual methods for exploring the spatial and temporal characteristics of open data, focusing primarily on place-based questions.

(3) Integration.  We wanted to provide a way for a scientist to take two or more data sets and analyze them without first having to align them temporally and spatially, given the diverse methods used for representing space and the many different temporal (and spatial) resolutions.

Working with social, economic, and other scientists we determined that a map-based, calendar-based search paradigm would be ideal, allowing a scientist or policymaker to ask ""what data is available about this geographic area (city, neighborhood, county) for a given period of time"" - where the geographic area and period of time correspond to a research question the scientist or policymaker wishes to ask, of an evaluation they wish to perform.  By starting with place and time we leave room for the user to discover data that might be relevant, but that they may not have considered (or known existed).

We then leveraged the fact that the vast majority of open data portals use either Socrata (commercial) or CKAN (open source) platforms, and thus we could provide scriptable extract-transform-load (ETL) capabilities to import data from many sources.  The ETL allows any user to find a data set on the web (ideally in a Socrata or CKAN portal), copy the URL for the data set of interest, and paste into a form on the http://plenar.io website.  Within hours the data is imported and aligned.

We keyed on data sets with common attributes of location and time, merging all data sets into a single scalable geospatial database, aligned over space and time.  We developed application programming interfaces APIs to support portal or application development, and build the http://plenar.io portal with these APIs.

The quality of APIs and the potential for data from many sources resulted in the City of Chicago using Plenario as its back-end for a community-facing portal (http://opengrid.io) -- rather than using their own data portal (from which Plenario draws Chicago data).

The City of Chicago's OpenGrid system, like Plenario, is open source and runs on commercial cloud services (Amazon Web Services, but engineered using portable methods that allow for trivial movement of the systems to other cloud systems, commercial or private, or to physical servers.)

The project provided unique opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and high school students. Each summer our programmers supervised teams of students who worked on the platform, interacting with data and social scientists frequently in context of (a) faculty members at UChicago, (b) the Data Science for Social Good program at UChicago, and (c) the scientists working in the Chief Data Officer's group within the City of Chicago.

All source code is open in Github (https://github.com/UrbanCCD-UChicago/plenario), and the Plenar.io system is featured as a resource for programs such as UChicago's Data Science for Social Good.

Plenario has also been extended to support sensor network data, and thus will be the primary access method for the NSF-funded Array of Things project (http://arrayofthings.us).  The extensions include new API calls to support applications and portals using sensor data as well as readily centering the default view over any city or geographic area (originally it defaulted to Chicago). For instance, three groups (a company, a university, and a not-for-profit) have already begun to independently develop mobile applications for air quality.  Other companies, for instance Panasonic, are using the APIs to enable AoT data to be imported into smart city dashboards.

215,"Cyberinfrastructure systems are large-scale information systems that are built for the purpose of supporting scientific collaboration within and across disciplines, research fields and subfields. Although scientific advances in an increasing number of disciplines depend on the development of cyberinfrastructures, the processes by which such systems are designed are not well understood. The proposed study will contribute to an understanding of how cyberinfrastructure systems are designed and developed, and in particular, how their design emerges out of social influence processes among the project stakeholders. The study will investigate the role that different stakeholders play in the design and development process, the ways in which their interests and priorities are aligned, and the social organization of development efforts. A qualitative study will be conducted to examine the collaboration and social influence behaviors of scientists, project managers, team leaders, experimenters, and campus CIOs and other stakeholders during the design and development of multiple clusters within the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) project, a unique virtual laboratory for at-scale networking experimentation. The project will describe the processes of collaborative design and development of cyberinfrastructure systems and identify interventions that might help promote the alignment of various stakeholder groups' interests and priorities.

By examining the process by which alternative designs are evaluated and the nature of stakeholder participation in design decisions, this study will contribute research and practical knowledge to the area of CI and large-scale IT development. Collaborations among institutions conducting work on social and organizational aspects of cyberinfrastructure systems will be established to more efficiently define common concerns.

GENI provides a virtual laboratory for studying advance computer networking architectures across four inter-related cyberinfrastructures. Our investigation studied the evolution of this overarching project as a sociotechnical organization across different stages of its development by focusing on the work different stakeholders engaged in. This research project advanced the state of knowledge about efforts to sucessfully sustain cyberinfrastructure projects from a nascent period of development into a state where the user base can grow and expand.

Through 52 stakeholder interviews&mdash;with project managers, developers, experimenters, and students&mdash;and obervations of project meetings we explain how different GENI stakeholders attempt to enlist new participants in the cyberinfrastructures of GENI, and leverage existing relationships to create a sustainable infrastructure organization. This study contributes to understandings of how cyberinfrastructures emerge over time by explaining processes of stakeholder alignment, enrollment, and the synergies among stakeholder groups.  We furthermore explored how the stakeholders in the GENI federated cyberinfrastructure project position existing, and newly created, resources for use in educational settings as a way to draw new users to the cyberinfrastructure organization. We examine how these stakeholders acquaint new potential stakeholders with this CI in order to draw them into the community over time.

Our findings convey how GENI experimenters and developers work to align their respective needs with scientists from different domains to enroll these scientists in this project and ensure they can use these advanced networking resources in their own research across instituational boundaries. Alignment and enrollment ranges from GENI stakeholders conducting a variety of outreach activities, holding workshops at quarterly conferences to demonstrate the features of the various GENI cyberinfrastructures in an effort to attract and enroll new experimenter stakeholders with the goal that they become active users who remain over time. GENI stakeholders work to position project resources so that they are useful to outsiders who have an interest in related topics.

Our findings also show how stakeholders in the GENI cyberinfrastructure are actively working to position its resources for use in educational settings. GENI Managers work to position existing bespoke tools (such as the GENI Portal &amp; Desktop for accessing the project's networking resources, and GENI Wiki that is a repository of project knowledge) so that stakeholders working as educators can leverage them in their courses. These GENI Managers also work with other stakeholders to create new resources, designed specifically for educational outreach (a GENI MOOC for open online courses, and workshop materials &amp; training sessions for stakeholders interested in using GENI in their courses) in order to facilitate the adoption of the GENI cyberinfrastructure in educational settings. Leveraging their different relationships, GENI Managers and Experimenters help to create a sociotechnical environment for stakeholders in the project to take on educator roles and function across the different constituent cyberinfrastructures, regardless of their home institution or of the constituent cyberinfrastructures with which they are currently familiar.





Findings from this study can apply beyond scientific cyberinfratructures by contributing to a better understanding of how distributed, large scale, sociotechnical organizations can be managed and sustained over time. Much like GENI?s stakeholders are dispersed across different universities and research labs, other organizations with similarly dispersed constituencies can benefit from adapting GENI?s management practices that promote the alignment of stakeholders? interests and the sharing of resources across institutional boundaries. GENI?s implementation of educational outreach activities provides a valuable insight for future development of cyberinfrastructure projects. Although further research is needed to better understand the effects of outreach activities on sustaining cyberinfrastructures long term, our results identify different types of outreach activities for consideration by managers, policymakers, and other stakeholders involved in cyberinfrastructure policy making.

216,"In this project, the researchers will collaborate with one of the foremost open education platforms, the Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU), to study how online cyberinfrastructure can be designed, implemented, and analyzed to foster educational experiences at a massive scale.  With the rise of massively-open online course platforms (MOOCs), there is a great need to understand how these infrastructure technologies can be used to facilitate open education at scale.   Specifically, this project involves (1) implementing and conducting design experiments on the P2PU platform, to generate new knowledge about how to improve cyberinfrastructures for open learning; (2) collecting and analyzing data from the P2PU platform to contribute foundational knowledge of open learning dynamics and the issues open learning communities face; and (3) working with P2PU to create and share publicly available datasets, practices, and standards that will spur wider big-data driven research on cyberinfrastructures for learning and education.

Enabled by new cyber-infrastructure technologies, a rapidly developing family of ""massively open online courses"" (MOOCs) hold the potential to make interactive educational experiences available at massive scale.  At the same time, researchers, educators, and policy makers are increasingly interested in the potential for big-data driven learning-analytics, to transform how educational experiences are designed, deployed and evaluated.  Together, these trends present several cyberinfrastructure challenges that will be explored in this project:

-- How should MOOC platforms be designed, deployed and evaluated? What design features support appropriate types of learner engagement?  How do features, such as badges and group recommendations, facilitate meaningful involvement?

-- How can developing MOOC platforms be used to meet the growing needs for cyberinfrastructure skills education and workforce development?  Do MOOCs provide a suitable platform for building the technical, managerial, and scientific skills necessary to use and support emerging cyberinfrastructures?  

-- What cyberinfrastructure is needed to support high-impact, data-driven learning-analytics research?  What data standards and practices are necessary to support studies of open communities for education and learning?  

MOOC platforms have significant potential to increase the accessibility of STEM training, and of education more generally.  Understanding open platforms such as P2PU also has the potential to broaden the population of individuals and institutions that can participate in the creation and design of open education experiences.  This project will help us better to understand a rapidly emerging, highly disruptive example of cyberinfrastructure (MOOC platforms).  The project will thus contribute to multiple research agendas in such fields as: computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL); human-computer interaction (HCI); virtual and online communities; and, more generally, information systems, and organization science.

While there have been numerous high profile successes involving ten's of thousands of students, these cases have all orignated from institutions that have substantial resources to draw on.   

The goal of the UMD-P2PU project was to better understand, and ultimately reduce, the costs and challenges associated with creating effective MOOCs, and in doing so increase the number and diversity of organizations and people that can create and run MOOCs.  

The results of the UMD-P2PU project include a publically available dataset describing the courses and actiivity on the P2PU Open MOOC platform and a series of peer-reviewed research papers modelling critical participant dynamics and describing central design challenges associated with MOOC creation.  The findings and results of the project have also informed design changes to the core P2PU platform (a publically available MOOC hosting system) and P2PU ""Course-in-a-box"", a collection of tools and materials designed to faciliate the creation of MOOCs by individuals and organizations that do not have extensive technology support or expertise in house.  

These results, findings, and publications serve to both advance our general understanding of how MOOCs function (or fail) and to make the power of MOOCs more widely available.

Calder, Palma, Charbonnier, Courtland, Bajo, Capra, Varley, Sheridan, Martinez-Hackert

2-day workshop on applying computational models to real-case scenarios for volcanic hazard assessment was held at the University of Colima, Mexico between 8-21 January 2013. The rationale behind the workshop was to provide instruction on the undertaking of quantitative volcanic hazard assessments and it was therefore designed to advance, and make more rigorous the process by which such assessments are achieved. If successful, such an endeavor would have direct and long-lived benefits to society, in terms of potential reduction of loss to lives, livelihoods, infrastructure and economy.

The PASI award provided funding for 48 international participants and instructors to attend from all regions of South, Central, and North America and the Caribbean. The workshop brought together 20 instructors who are international experts covering four major discipline groups (geology, geophysics, mathematics, and geography), and also included senior scientists from international government institutions responsible for volcanic hazard assessments including SERNAGEOMIN of Chile and the Seismic Research Center of Trinidad. Young researchers from eleven countries received training in the workshop, these included graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and employees at government institutions responsible for the mitigation of volcanic hazards in their regions. Funded places on the workshop were advertised and participants were selected based on prioritization of the anticipated impact on the scientific endeavors of the participant and potential for long-lived benefits to society, as well as broadening diversity.

The workshop focused on advancing the breadth and depth of understanding of the range of methodologies and procedures currently available for undertaking rigorous hazard assessments at volcanoes. The schedule combined 4 days of lecture-based instruction, 3 days of field-based instruction studying deposits around the flanks of Fuego de Colima Volcano and 4 days of hands-on computational modeling sessions held at the computer laboratory of the Faculty of Science at the University of Colima. Workshop modules stepped through the complete process, from collection of rudimentary information about the volcanoÆs past activity to providing a hazard assessment based on computational modeling using a suit of up-to-date simulation tools. The workshop took advantage of the rapidly-growing VHub cyber-infrastructure platform (http://vhub.org), through which users can access simulation tools, tutorials, and support networks. The VHub environment is well-suited to facilitate access to modeling for individuals in the geoscience community who may not be experienced or routine users of computational tools.

Workshop goals

For many volcanoes hazard assessments are not currently available, or are inadequate, and many regions have limited expertise, resources and accessibility to cutting-edge science that hampers progress to address this situation. The workshop aims were to enrich the knowledge base of the participants in order to advance the following goals: 1) Increased understanding of the fundamentals of volcanic hazard assessment; 2) Exposure to an array of methodologies and tools available for the task; 3) Introduction to working as small multi-disciplinary teams that discuss the relationship between field studies, computational modeling and hazard assessment; 4) Knowledge and practice of using computational modeling, support networks and management tools within the VHub environment, and 5) Analysis of the results of field and modeling outcomes in order to understand the suitable applications and, importantly, limitations of the approaches. The broader goals for the workshop outcomes were to: 1) Improve the accuracy of hazard assessments used by stakeholders; 2) Promo...",,,11/01/2012,"Pan-American Studies Institute: Applying Computational Models to Real-Case Scenarios for Volcanic Hazard Assessment; University of Colima, Mexico, January 2013",Grant
218,"The Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS), a consortium of over 110 research universities and institutions dedicated to monitoring the Earth and exploring its interior through the collection and distribution of seismological data, will provide up to 12 undergraduate students per year with research experiences as part of its 9-11 week internship program. Through this program, students will take part in an intensive week-long preparatory course, and work with leaders in seismological research, in both lab-base and field-based settings, to produce research products worthy of presentation at large professional conferences. Given that the Consortium is a collection of institutions, the program employs a distributed REU model that has been demonstrated to bond students into a cohort, despite conducting their research at geographically distributed sites. Some elements of this model include: an emphasis on the acquisition and analysis of seismic data to help address broader Earth science questions, an orientation week to build the cohort through shared experiences, a cyber-infrastructure to nourish group cohesion while enabling peer-learning and collaboration, the opportunity to reconnect face-to-face and become integrated into the intern alumni network while presenting research at a large professional conference, and an Alumni Mentor to provide experienced, consistent support throughout the entire summer. 

Not only does this program develop seismological knowledge through intern research, this unique REU model has the opportunity to contribute to the growing body of knowledge regarding the application of cyber-infrastructure for distance learning, community building, and the implementation of the skills associated with metacognition. The success, documentation and dissemination of this model, will also enable other organizations to apply geographically distributed resources to the development of their human capital. Additionally, this proposal presents an opportunity to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in the study of seismology.

The Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) is a consortium of over 120 research universities and institutions dedicated to monitoring the Earth and exploring its interior through the collection and distribution of seismological data. Through this award, IRIS?s Education and Public Outreach Program (EPO) provided 55 undergraduate students with research experiences in geophysics through the development of a 9 to 11-week summer internship program. In addition to providing high quality learning experiences to this group of students, we were able to extend the impact of the award, by leveraging the programming and infrastructure to support thirteen additional students through other funding sources. Because these students? costs were supported through other funding sources they are not included in the reporting below. Research conducted through this program contributes to our understanding of the Earth System and our interactions with it. This includes explorations of how faults rupture and slip, induced seismicity, fault mapping and hazards assessments, the development of geothermal energy sources, explorations of new technologies and techniques, as well as many other aspects of seismology.

Our program was constructed as a blended-REU site (Hubenthal &amp; Judge, 2011), where interns first gather for a week-long orientation to learn seismological basics and build a cohesive cohort through a collection of intentional shared experiences. Participants disperse to conduct 8 to 10 weeks of research with research mentors at universities from across the IRIS Consortium. While students each work on their own unique project, all placements have a common scientific focus emphasizing the acquisition and analysis of seismic data to help address broader Earth science questions. During this period, a cyberinfrastructure is used to nourish group cohesion and enable peer-learning and collaboration. Over the course of these 8 to 10 weeks the interns, with the support of the cohort, mentoring tools developed by IRIS EPO, and their research mentor, transitioned towards becoming independent researchers through a carefully structured research experience. By the end of the summer, all participants submitted an abstract of their research to present at a national conference; most frequently the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union. In the fall following their research, they present the results of their research at the conference. This experience provided each intern with a professionally enriching interaction with the broader scientific community, allowed the cohort to reconnect face-to-face, and for each individual to become integrated into our strong alumni network through an alumni networking function.

We are currently in the process of tracking participants to determine the long-term impact the program has had on their career trajectories. While it will take a few more years to fully track participants funded through this award, preliminary results suggest that the program is successful in encouraging and enabling geoscience majors (n=32), and other science majors, such as physics and math (n=23), to pursue careers in the geosciences. We anticipate results similar to past awards where ~90% of participants pursue graduate degrees and/or are employed in the geosciences post internship (Hubenthal &amp; Judge, 2011).

In addition to this direct work with interns, we have also developed an alumni speakers program to recruit minority applications. A dynamic, early career alumni visits physics and/or geoscience departments at minority serving institutions to deliver a lecture focused on cutting edge research, explicit connections to core classroom content, and information on geoscience careers. This series differs from a traditional departmental seminar series in that it is designed to engage mid-level undergraduate students, rather than a pure research talk largely aimed at the faculty in the department. Through this program, over 24 seismology recruitment talks were delivered to primarily physics departments on campuses containing large populations of students from communities traditionally underrepresented in the geosciences. This expanded lecture series has been successful as we increased the percentage of applications to the program from populations traditionally underrepresented in the geosciences from an average of 8.5% (2006-2011) to an average of 11.5% (2012-2016). Importantly, we our efforts also increased the participation of these populations in the program from an average of 5.5% (2006-2011) to an average of 22% from 2012 to 2016.

219,"The Quake-Catcher Network (QCN) is a transformative approach to earthquake detection, science, and outreach. The QCN is a distributed computing project that links internal (no cost, built-in) or external (low cost, USB-based) accelerometers connected to any participating computer for earthquake research.
Leveraging an innovative set of cyber-enabled seismic observations, this approach will enable the creation of a very dense, low-cost seismic network that can explore earthquake fault rupture in real-time, establish ground response to seismic wave passage, and quantify the shaking effects on critical structures. Results from a one-year exploratory grant from the NSF Cyber-Infrastructure Teaching, Education, Advancement and Mentoring program indicate QCN has the ability to be a new and transformative type of network, which is scalable and easy to deploy world-wide. Increasing the number of QCN sensors from 1,000 to more than 30,000 worldwide and developing efficient schemes to ingest, process, and distribute Terabytes of data will allow us to (1) explore fault mechanics (including directionality, slip distribution, and rupture velocity) at unprecedented resolutions, (2) study ground motions to assess seismic hazard and building response and (3) analyze data in real time for earthquake early warning and rapid response. This proposal will result in network with 6,000 new USB sensors and tens of thousands of no-cost sensors
commonly built internal to laptops and other devices. Additionally, QCN will provide the cyberinfrastructure to process and analyze the large new seismic data sets in near-real time and to foster collaboration between 1000?s of researchers and interested participants around the world. The framework
laid by this project will enable rapid expansion of the network internationally and will allow us to grow the network at a fraction of the cost of traditional seismic instrumentation and infrastructure, providing valuable data to augment the existing seismic networks.The success of the Quake-Catcher Network is intrinsically linked to the broader participation of the general public; members of the public, schools (K-12, undergraduate and graduate), and community organizations host QCN sensors.

Zanzerkia,7032928556,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The Quake-Catcher Network (QCN) involves participants from communities at large to install low-cost accelerometers in houses and high-rise building offices for assessment of shaking intensity due to earthquakes. QCN has as its main objective the generation of high spatial resolution acceleration data that can aid in emergency response. Temporary international deployments of QCN accelerometers are conducted to record aftershock data in countries including New Zealand, Chile, and Haiti. QCN sensors can be connected to volunteersÆ computers via a standard USB connection. In addition, a stand-alone package has been developed that includes a sensor, digitizer, plug-computer, and in some cases additional battery for backup power. Both the USB-connected and stand-alone packages require power and an internet connection using either Ethernet or wifi. Each sensorÆs host computer or dedicated processor runs a client application that reads in the continuous acceleration time series and executes an event-detection algorithm on the time series. This is to detect earthquake or other shaking source events that cause a vibration response in the buildings or ground. The QCN sensors in buildings are connected to netbooks with continuous data streaming in real?time via the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing software program to a server at Stanford University.

Four buildings have been instrumented by QCN, with the long-term goal of being able to show building response in real time. The continuous time series waveform data are being used to evaluate building response parameters such as peak acceleration, peak velocity, and inter-story drift values. In addition, building modal properties such as fundamental and higher mode frequencies and mode shapes are being computed from small and moderate earthquake data from the building. To demonstrate how that goal might be achieved for multiple buildings for which only minimal structural information is known, simple approximate models have been developed for several instrumented structures, including the QCN-instrumented Factor building on the UCLA campus in west Los Angeles, CA. In each case, the building is represented as an elastic continuum of the appropriate elastic properties. In cases where flexure is a significant component of the response, we apply the prismatic Timoshenko beam model with soil-structure interaction to approximate the dynamic linear elastic behavior. The 15-story steel moment-frame Factor building can be well-approximated by a simple shear beam verified by examination of earthquake records from the building.

A method to rapidly estimate the total displacement response of a building based on limited observational data, in some cases from only a single seismometer has been developed. The total response of a building is modeled by the combination of the initial vibrating motion due to an upward traveling wave, and the subsequent motion as the low-frequency resonant mode response. It is demonstrated that resonant mode response alone does not adequately capture the full building response, and that a transient traveling wave comprises a significant part of the total response. The method here uses the estimated mode shapes based on frequency ratios constrained by the limited observational data, and the shear beam or Timoshenko beam representation of the building. Seismic records from a 54-story building in downtown Los Angeles and dynamic response computations using a finite-element model of the 17-story UCLA Factor building are used to verify the method. The numerical results demonstrate how the relative significance of the traveling wave component of building response is dependent on the frequency content of the input excitation. The method is particularly applicable to newly expanding crowd-sourced seismic networks such as QCN. In some cases with these networks, a building is equipped with only one seismometer. The method can be straightforwardly applied to multiple in...",,"['Elizabeth S. Cochran, Jesse F.

 The Education Partnership in Climate Change and Sustainability (EPiCCS) provided research and educational experiences thematically centered on sustainability, green energy technology, and the effects of global climate change for a population of students that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines. EPiCCS built on an ongoing partnership between the HU Marine Science Department, ECSU Biology Department, and VIMS  that has successfully trained underrepresented undergraduates and provided paths to graduate education in the geosciences. The EPiCCS program:  (1) supported the recruitment, development, and retention of talented HBCU STEM students to participate in interdisciplinary training and education on sustainability and global climate change, (2) improved technology and cyberinfrastructure at the two HBCUs to enrich experiential inquiry-based learning, support the development of new course offerings, and modernize current offerings, promoted collaborative cross-campus cyberlearning, (4) built essential competencies in oral and written scientific communication in the next generation of geoscientists; and (5) guided students toward post-graduate STEM degrees via peer and faculty mentorship.   The projectÆs Broader impacts included: (1) its focus on the recruitment, support, and development of students from underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines; (2) the development of new interdisciplinary courses and workshops, and invigoration of extant courses to emphasize inquiry-based, experiential training in and practical applications of climate change and sustainable science in freshman through senior courses, (3) the application of new cyberlearning infrastructure to enable collaborative experimental design and analysis and cross- campus anytime-anywhere learning via new Smartboards and videoconferencing cyberinfrastructure in teaching laboratories at the two HBCUs, (4) fostering a culture of interdisciplinary cooperation among students, faculty, and programs at two HBCUs; and (5) the mastery of critical thinking and communication skills on the interdependent sociopolitical issues related to sustainable energy, global climate change, and sustainable stewardship of living resources and ecosystems of the future.  Over 600 students were impacted by new course offerings, revisions of extant courses, enhanced technology and pedagogy, and increased research opportunities over the lifetime of this project.  EPiCCS students organized two Teen Environmental Conferences, an Environmental Justice and Sustainability Panel session, and were involved in community outreach aquaculture projects.  The EPiCCS project contributed to Departmental infrastructure, a revision of the Department of Marine and Environmental ScienceÆs curriculum, and matriculation of the UniversityÆs first US Marshall Scholar and first John A.

Engineering and wildlife ecology researchers from University of Missouri, UIUC, and North Carolina Natural Sciences Museum have developed an eMammal cyber-infrastructure with a suite of visual informatics tools for automated content analysis and management to support large-scale wildlife monitoring by citizen scientists. We have developed machine learning and computer vision methods and software tools for segmenting animals from the highly cluttered background in camera-trap images, track animals, recognizing animal species, and extracting biometric features of animals. We have achieved the state-of-the-art performance in animal object segmentation. We have achieved an average of 90% animal species recognition performance on camera-trap images for top 5 recommendations. The image analysis and computer vision algorithms developed in this project have been extensively tested, integrated into professionally designed software, and distributed to public.  We have established the eMammal infrastructure for camera-trap data collection, uploading, archiving, processing, and management. This project has advanced the state-of-the-art in computer vision research, especially on object segmentation and classification in unstructured and cluttered natural environments. This new eMammal cyber-infrastructure has the potential to transform the practice of wildlife monitoring and will enable a host of new opportunities in conservation, ecological, and environmental research.

We have recruited over 500 volunteers to monitor wildlife with camera traps run at &gt;2300 locations in 32 parks across 6 states. This represents &gt;130 camera-years of survey efforts and has recorded 2.6 million wildlife photos.

This project involves citizen scientists to collect and annotate camera-trap data. It provides a unique education opportunity for the public on advanced image analysis research and its applications. Our graduate students, our technicians and post docs are developing and refining their skills through experiences in software development, field evaluations, and statistical data analysis. The camera-trap images captured by camera traps are often beautiful, dramatic, and captivating.  These help to connect people with nature.  The website we developed to share camera trap pictures with the public (Smithsonian Wild) has had over 600,000 visits in the past two years. Another measure of interest is the return rate of visitors, which at 36% for the website, is the highest measure of visitor loyalty for any website at Natural History Museum, and likely any across the Smithsonian.

222,"The Quake-Catcher Network (QCN) is a transformative approach to earthquake detection, science, and outreach. The QCN is a distributed computing project that links internal (no cost, built-in) or external (low cost, USB-based) accelerometers connected to any participating computer for earthquake research.
Leveraging an innovative set of cyber-enabled seismic observations, this approach will enable the creation of a very dense, low-cost seismic network that can explore earthquake fault rupture in real-time, establish ground response to seismic wave passage, and quantify the shaking effects on critical structures. Results from a one-year exploratory grant from the NSF Cyber-Infrastructure Teaching, Education, Advancement and Mentoring program indicate QCN has the ability to be a new and transformative type of network, which is scalable and easy to deploy world-wide. Increasing the number of QCN sensors from 1,000 to more than 30,000 worldwide and developing efficient schemes to ingest, process, and distribute Terabytes of data will allow us to (1) explore fault mechanics (including directionality, slip distribution, and rupture velocity) at unprecedented resolutions, (2) study ground motions to assess seismic hazard and building response and (3) analyze data in real time for earthquake early warning and rapid response. This proposal will result in network with 6,000 new USB sensors and tens of thousands of no-cost sensors
commonly built internal to laptops and other devices. Additionally, QCN will provide the cyberinfrastructure to process and analyze the large new seismic data sets in near-real time and to foster collaboration between 1000?s of researchers and interested participants around the world. The framework
laid by this project will enable rapid expansion of the network internationally and will allow us to grow the network at a fraction of the cost of traditional seismic instrumentation and infrastructure, providing valuable data to augment the existing seismic networks.The success of the Quake-Catcher Network is intrinsically linked to the broader participation of the general public; members of the public, schools (K-12, undergraduate and graduate), and community organizations host QCN sensors.

Zanzerkia,7032928556,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The Quake-Catcher Network (QCN) involves participants from communities at large to install low-cost accelerometers in houses and high-rise building offices for assessment of shaking intensity due to earthquakes. QCN has as its main objective the generation of high spatial resolution acceleration data that can aid in emergency response. Temporary international deployments of QCN accelerometers are conducted to record aftershock data in countries including New Zealand, Chile, and Haiti. QCN sensors can be connected to volunteersÆ computers via a standard USB connection. In addition, a stand-alone package has been developed that includes a sensor, digitizer, plug-computer, and in some cases additional battery for backup power. Both the USB-connected and stand-alone packages require power and an internet connection using either Ethernet or wifi. Each sensorÆs host computer or dedicated processor runs a client application that reads in the continuous acceleration time series and executes an event-detection algorithm on the time series. This is to detect earthquake or other shaking source events that cause a vibration response in the buildings or ground. The QCN sensors in buildings are connected to netbooks with continuous data streaming in real?time via the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing software program to a server at Stanford University.

Four buildings have been instrumented by QCN, with the long-term goal of being able to show building response in real time. The continuous time series waveform data are being used to evaluate building response parameters such as peak acceleration, peak velocity, and inter-story drift values. In addition, building modal properties such as fundamental and higher mode frequencies and mode shapes are being computed from small and moderate earthquake data from the building. To demonstrate how that goal might be achieved for multiple buildings for which only minimal structural information is known, simple approximate models have been developed for several instrumented structures, including the QCN-instrumented Factor building on the UCLA campus in west Los Angeles, CA. In each case, the building is represented as an elastic continuum of the appropriate elastic properties. In cases where flexure is a significant component of the response, we apply the prismatic Timoshenko beam model with soil-structure interaction to approximate the dynamic linear elastic behavior. The 15-story steel moment-frame Factor building can be well-approximated by a simple shear beam verified by examination of earthquake records from the building.

A method to rapidly estimate the total displacement response of a building based on limited observational data, in some cases from only a single seismometer has been developed. The total response of a building is modeled by the combination of the initial vibrating motion due to an upward traveling wave, and the subsequent motion as the low-frequency resonant mode response. It is demonstrated that resonant mode response alone does not adequately capture the full building response, and that a transient traveling wave comprises a significant part of the total response. The method here uses the estimated mode shapes based on frequency ratios constrained by the limited observational data, and the shear beam or Timoshenko beam representation of the building. Seismic records from a 54-story building in downtown Los Angeles and dynamic response computations using a finite-element model of the 17-story UCLA Factor building are used to verify the method. The numerical results demonstrate how the relative significance of the traveling wave component of building response is dependent on the frequency content of the input excitation. The method is particularly applicable to newly expanding crowd-sourced seismic networks such as QCN. In some cases with these networks, a building is equipped with only one seismometer. The method can be straightforwardly applied to multiple i...",,"['Elizabeth S. Cochran, Jesse F.

The project will renovate an old, uninsulated building that is currently used for environmental research at the University of California Merced (UC Merced) Sierra Nevada Research Institute (SNRI) Wawona Field Station in Yosemite National Park.  The result of the renovation will be an interdisciplinary, energy-efficient, networked center for computational modeling, eco-informatics, and data visualization. The center will support a variety of ongoing and future, computationally intensive research at the interface of science and natural resource management. Cyberinfrastructure upgrades will include high speed internet connections to the UC Merced campus for remote data storage and processing.  Infrastructure improvements will include: weather proofing, roof repair, an upgraded electrical system, and heating and cooling upgrades.   

The Wawona Field Station (WFS) supports Sierra Nevada Research Institute (SNRI) research and facilitates synergistic links among academic research, science education, natural resource management, and the arts. The WFS provides unique opportunities for research at the interface of science, resource management, and scientific communication. The WFS is a broad-based field station that supports research projects involving traditional field station activities and, more recently, the use of embedded sensor networks for spatially and temporally intensive measurements. However, WFS serves more functions than a traditional field station. Researchers who engage in field activities at WFS also do computationally intense synthesis, analysis, and visualization of remote sensing data, spatially explicit field data, temporally rich sensor network data, and data from other remote data libraries (e.g., genome sequence data). Addressing interdisciplinary environmental questions at landscape scales requires that field data be tightly coupled in real time with data synthesis and visualization to help refine and target subsequent field sampling. The renovated structure will facilitate interdisciplinary cross-scale research and enhance the Sierra Nevada Research Institute?s current activities including change detection in hydrological and ecological systems. The renovated facility will also provide research experiences to members of one of the most diverse student bodies in the University of California system, thus increasing interest in science among traditionally underrepresented student populations.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MERCED,5200 North Lake Road,Merced,US,Merced,CA16,University of California - Merced,CA,953435001,47.083,"['Roger C Bales', 'Thomas C Harmon', 'Qinghua  Guo', 'Anna Carolin  Frank']",09/18/2010,113645084,411600,03/31/2013,4900,ACADEMIC RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTU,411600,0963544,071549000,Roger C Bales,5200 North Lake Road,Merced,US,Merced,CA16,University of California - Merced,CA,953435001,rbales@ucmerced.edu,Roger,Bales,C,2092284348,smeacham@nsf.gov,Stephen Meacham,7032928970,040101 RRA RECOVERY ACT,"The mission of the Sierra Nevada Research InstituteÆs (SNRI) Yosemite Field Station (YFS) is to support interdisciplinary environmental research and facilitate synergistic links among academic research, science education, natural resource management, and the arts. The YFS location inside Yosemite and adjacent to the Sierra National Forest provides exceptional opportunities for research at the interface of science, resource management, and scientific communication. YFS is much more than a traditional field station. SNRI researchers use the facility for computationally intense synthesis, analysis, and visualization of remote sensing data, spatially explicit field data, temporally rich sensor network data, and other remote data libraries (e.g., genome sequence data). During the extended winter season, when field research is limited, the YFSÆs location is ideal for hosting collaborative research groups focused on data synthesis, interdisciplinary collaboration, and conceptual integration. The YFS facility was ill equipped to meet its full potential in this regard because of inadequate cyber infrastructure and research space. The building that was renovated (hereafter, ""historic stable"") is the only available collaborative research space. In addition to lacking reliable network connectivity, the original configuration was un-usable during the winter months as well as during summer hot spells owing to inadequate insulation, inefficient layout and deteriorating condition. The growth and development of SNRI research, and particularly of research collaborations among SNRI and federal agency scientists in Yosemite (e.g., National Park Service (NPS) and the US Geological Survey (USGS) researchers) was severely limited by this lack of quality collaborative research space with easy access to remote data libraries and cyber-infrastructure for analyzing, visualizing, and sharing data. The renovations to the research space were specifically designed to meet these diverse needs in a compact (~800 ft2) space by optimizing it for multiple uses that range from individual to collaborative (both real and virtual) computational research and facilitating the integration of field data with remote sensing, virtual data libraries, and geospatial data stored in remote servers.

 

The renovation of the historic stable was completed within a year, and has resulted in the wonderfully versatile space that has been used by the UC Merced faculty and students, national and international researchers, the Yosemite National Park Service, the US Forest Service, and the US Geological Survey, for collaborative interdisciplinary research and professional development. We have been the venue for a 55-person international conference on Symbiosis, and acted as a base of operation for several intern programs serving a diverse student base from around the country. These interns are part of the Yosemite Leadership Program, a jointly run UC Merced and Yosemite National Park Service 2 year program, the NSF-supported Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, and the Adventure Risk Challenge high school leadership and literacy program.

 

The renovation of the historic stable has doubled our year-round, high-quality research space, allowing a larger and wider audience to use the facilities, broadening our impact across the research landscape and allowing us to more fully complete our mission.

224,"This project contributes to the exciting field of geo-stream processing. 
Specifically, an integrated real-time geo-stream processing and monitoring 
system called AegisDB will be built and the research environment and results 
will be leveraged to stimulate learning at the K-12, undergraduate, and  
graduate levels. 

The AegisDB system includes a Geo-Stream Algebra which uses a data-type-
based approach as opposed to a traditional tuple-based approach for 
representing and querying geo-streams. The STREAM data types of the 
algebra unify static data, traditional streams, geo-streams from fixed 
locations, and geo-streams that move. The proposed Aggregate Algebra 
generalizes the operator GROUP BY to generalized aggregations (GAs) 
and bridges the fundamental gap between point observations from sensors 
and spatio-temporally continuous phenomena.  Several novel 
spatial-centric operator optimization techniques are proposed, 
which include a velocity-based filtering that utilizes the physical 
limitations of most moving objects and a spatial-coverage-based query 
combination that combines geo-stream queries based on 
their intended spatial coverage.

The proposed AegisDB system will transform the ways to define and monitor 
more sophisticated spatio-temporal events for alerting purposes. The result is 
the significantly improved realtime access to important spatio-temporal events 
related to our lives by professionals and the general public. The system will 
be critical for important domains including transportation, environmental 
science, hazard monitoring, and emergency responses.  
 
This project has strong education and outreach components.  Environmental 
models for K-12 teachers and students using real-time environmental datasets 
will be designed. An informal session on how to collect, store, and distribute 
environmental data will be presented through the Family Fun Science 
Saturday events of the Elm Fork Education Center of UNT. A course module 
on geo-stream processing will be developed. Women and minorities will be 
recruited into the research project. Undergraduate students looking for 
research opportunities will be mentored.

Spengler,7032928930,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The goal of this project is to build a real-time geo-stream processing and monitoring system that: (1) uniform geo-streams and large volumes of static infrastructure datasets (e.g., road networks), (2) allows spatially explicit monitoring queries, and (3) spits out results in real time even in disastrous situations when data volumes are often high. Such a system can serve as the backend of many spatial reference stream systems such as smart transportation systems and a sensor web just as traditional databases did for many applications.

Our first major research contribution is the design and implementation of a geo-stream algebra to support moving and evolving spatial objects, e.g. trajectories and evolving regions, in real-time. Our research activity focused on designing a data-type-based approach where an entityÆs spatial extent over time can be managed as a data type and participate in common spatio-temporal predicates. The geo-stream algebra has a set of operators that are simple, closed, expressive, and easy to implement to support typical geo-stream queries. Our second major research contribution is the design and implementation of an aggregate algebra that generalizes GROUP BY query. This allows spatial cluster queries to be posted which are important for many applications but were not supported before. Our third major research contribution is operator scheduling and query optimization to support fast and efficient queries and analytics on large volume of geo-streams in real-time.

Throughout the project, many students have been trained in the area of database systems, map matching, real-time scheduling, data stream processing, spatio-temporal data mining, and performance evaluation. Specifically, students have been trained in polygonizatoin algorithms, kinetic data structures, streaming data abstraction, geo-stream query languages, stream optimization, visualizing geo-streams, and big geo-stream data analytics. Throughout the project, 7 Ph.D. students have been trained and 3 Ph.D. theses have been developed and successfully defended. A dozen masters and undergraduate students have participated in the project. Four undergraduate students were supported and resulted in 5 peer-reviewed undergraduate co-authored papers in top tier journal and conferences. We hosted 2 projects for the Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) and 1 TechFest program for K-12 students.

225,"The W.K. Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) of Michigan State University (MSU) has been awarded a grant to enhance educational and research opportunities by renovating nine ponds at the Experimental Pond Facility, improving cyber-infrastructure connectivity to the pond site, and installing emergency backup power at the facility. KBS is the largest off-campus unit of MSU and is known worldwide as a premier field site for research, education, and outreach in ecology and evolutionary biology. KBS provides access to diverse natural and managed habitats, many suitable for experimentation, together with modern laboratory facilities, to conduct terrestrial and aquatic ecology. Research activity at KBS has grown to the point that some of our facilities are stretched to the limit. The increasing numbers of resident and visiting researchers working at the Experimental Pond Site, along with a growing diversity and number of educational and outreach activities using this and other KBS facilities, are putting increasing demand on infrastructure and require that we upgrade and improve the facilities.

The nine ponds that will be renovated have undergone natural succession over the past 20+ years and have become unsuitable for many types of experimental studies due to low oxygen conditions and dense stands of submersed vegetation.  Renovation of these ponds will allow KBS to continue to serve the needs of resident and visiting scientists, while ensuring flexibility for experimental design. Funds from this award also will be used to connect the Experimental Pond Facility to a 1Gb fiber optic backbone that now links KBS to MSU's main campus (fiber optic backbone installed in fall 2009 with MSU funds). This connection between the pond site and the KBS academic building will provide cyber-infrastructure support for data transfer between automated sensors at the pond site and other new instrumentation between the pond laboratory, the KBS main site, and MSU's campus.

These facility improvements have greatly enhanced research and education activities at both aquatic and terrestrial field sites by improving computer connectivity and high speed data transmission, safeguarding experiments involving the care of animals and plants by providing backup electrical power in the event of a power outage, and improving the availability and usefulness of the experimental pond array for visiting and resident researchers.

Nine of the 10 experimental ponds renovated in 2010 were used for experiments in the summers of 2011 and 2012. These experiments involved a number of fish species, including two important sport fishes (largemouth bass and bluegill sunfish), and examined how inter-individual variation in fish behaviors impacted their growth, survival, and reproductive success under semi-natural field conditions. Two Ph.D. students, two postdoctoral researchers, and six undergraduate students conducted experiments in the newly renovated ponds during the 2011 and 2012 field seasons. The two Ph.D. students were recently awarded NSF Dissertation Improvement Grants (2012 and 2013) to fund addtional behavioral research in the KBS ponds. Along with the pond renovations, Improved computer connectivity to the experimental pond site via wireless upgrades and new fiber optic cable allows for high speed data transmission from all locations within the aquatic and terrestrial experimental facilities. The renovated ponds have also been used for teaching and outreach activities. These teachings and outreach activities include: 1) field exercises by students in the MSU 'SpartaNature' course, which introduces incoming freshmen to research in biology, and 2) field trips by local school groups (e.g., 100 8th grade students from the Olivet, MI school district in 2010) to see ongoing research. These field trips by school groups have been conduced as part of an NSF funded GK-12 program at the Kellogg Biological Station.

The automatic backup generators installed at the pond site laboratory and terrestrial field laboratory are opporating effectively to supply emergency power during power outages, protecting ongoing experiments and animals housed at the site.

226,"Wireless cellular networks serve as an essential cyber-infrastructure for mobile users. Unlike the Internet, cellular networks have adopted usage-based charging, rather than the simpler flat-rate charging. Data-plan subscribers have to pay their data bills based on the consumed traffic volume in 3G/4G networks. Although this metered charging system has been operational and generally successful for years, the security study of such a system remains largely unaddressed. The objective of this research is to investigate the insecurity aspects of large-scale cellular network infrastructures, identify their security loopholes, sketch novel attacks that exploit such loopholes, devise defenses that protect from such attacks, and validate the attacks and the defenses via real experiments in operational carriers. The proposed study helps us to better understand how various forms of vulnerabilities exhibit in the cellular system, open new venue for secure system design and operations, and refine the networking design that makes both the infrastructure and the user devices more resilient against malicious threats.

By addressing the key security issues of mobile data charging, the proposed research helps to protect the multi-trillion dollar network operations. It not only secures revenues of global cellular operators, but also protects the monetary rights of billions of mobile users.

227,"The project from East Carolina University (ECU) titled ""An Online Student-Centric Game-Based Learning System for Cybersecurity Education"" aims to respond to the critical need for highly-educated and skilled cybersecurity professionals that are able to recognize, prevent, and mitigate threats to the nation's critical cyber infrastructure. The project proposes to develop and implement a unique, student-centric, game-based, virtualized learning system that provides comprehensive cybersecurity awareness education for ECU undergraduate students, Community College students, and will provide a train-the-trainer capability for regional Community College instructors.

The learning solution will provide students and instructors with multiple real-world cybersecurity learning scenarios, where each scenario will represent a realistic cyber threat requiring students to develop appropriate mitigation strategies. The learning solution will integrate multiple virtual machines (VMs) that will incorporate not only autonomous and student-configured attack platforms, but also student-configured and defended firewalls, resources and other network components. In addition, the solution will allow cyberattack and cyber-defense interactions among students, as well as autonomous attack VMs, making the scenarios similar to real-world networks, while emphasizing student teamwork to counter these attacks. The learning solution will be designed to support both face-to-face and online delivery modalities, allowing for synchronous and asynchronous activities. Students will be able to access the learning environment at any time and from any location. This project will also support workforce development seminars for Community College students and faculty. The major processing and resources will be provided by ECU; users only need internet access, minimal computer resources, and a web browser to access any of the cybersecurity learning scenarios.

228,"Modern critical infrastructure relies on successful interdependent function among many different types of networks. For example, the Internet depends on access to the power grid, which in turn depends on the power-grid communication network and the energy production network. For this reason, network science researchers have begun examining the robustness of critical infrastructure as a network of networks, or a multilayer network. Research in network anomaly detection systems has focused on single network structures (specifically, the Internet as a single network). Among these methods, some promising detection algorithms rely on decentralized and distributed coordination among many participants, improving meaningfully over results from independent parallel and centralized algorithms. The project involves rigorous analysis of the different challenges and opportunities for anomaly detection posed by multilayer networks relative to single network structures, with a particular focus on how cross-layer information can be effectively used to improve both efficiency and detection as well as how cross-layer threats can create vulnerabilities. 

The project develops a general framework that can be used in multiple applications to detect large-scale threats to information flow for enhanced security. This has the potential for significant benefit to society through its contribution to enhanced resiliency in the nation's cyber infrastructure and other interdependent critical infrastructure such as the power grid.

229,"This workshop will provide a forum for constructive dialogue between publishing professionals and members of various stakeholder communities with a shared interest in public dissemination of scholarly research in engineering and the information sciences, as represented by a variety of IEEE societies including, Signal Processing, Control Systems, Robotics and Automation, Information Theory, and Circuits and Systems. Participants will explore three interrelated and increasingly important questions concerning future approaches to deriving the maximum possible benefit from the products of engineering research:

1. What are the essential products of scholarly engineering research, how will these be likely to change in the future?

2. What are economically sustainable approaches to providing public access to engineering research products?

3. As nontraditional types of research products (e.g. data and software) become a significant component of the curated engineering research record, how should quality assurance be organized and paid for?

The goal of ensuring that future engineering research will be maximally reproducible underlies all these questions. Workshop presentations by publishing professionals will explore current and planned approaches to data and software curation in engineering and other disciplines. There will also be presentations by data professionals who currently provide platforms for such curation as well as those engaged in research on fundamental data science, data infrastructure, and cyber-infrastructure. Using new curation and publishing technologies to most effectively harvest value from curated research products will be explored in alignment with stated National Science Foundation objectives of developing new advances in data infrastructure and analytics, reproducibility, privacy and protection, and research in the human-data interface. 

The topics to be covered by the workshop include,

- Data curation -ethical data management

- Software curation

- Versioning of archival literature

- Research reproducibility -including reproducibility metrics

- Peer review -data, software, versions - how to manage

- The evolving relationship between scholarly publishers, researchers, and research libraries.

230,"The cyber infrastructure that supports science research (such as the cyberinfrastructure that provides access to unique scientific instrumentation such as a telescope, or an array of highly distributed sensors placed in the field, or a computational supercomputing center) faces the daunting challenge of defending against cyber attacks. Modest to medium research project teams have little cyber security expertise to defend against the increasingly diverse, advanced and constantly evolving attacks. Even larger facilities that have with security expertise are often overwhelmed with the amount of security log data they need to analyze in order to identify attackers and attacks, which is the first step to defending against them.  The challenges of the traditional approach of identifying an attacker are amplified by the lack of tools and time to detect attacks skillfully hidden in the noise of ongoing network traffic. The challenge is not necessarily in deploying additional monitoring but to identify this malicious traffic by utilizing all available information found in the plethora of security, network, and system logs that are already being actively collected.  This project proposes to build and deploy,  is needed in research environments, an advanced log analysis tool, named AttackTagger, that can scale to be able to address the dramatic increase in security log data, and detect emerging threat patterns in today's constantly evolving security landscape. AttackTagger will make science research in support of national priorities more secure.

AttackTagger will be a sophisticated log analysis tool designed to find potentially malicious activity, such as credential theft, by building factor graph models for advanced pattern matching.  AttackTagger will integrate with existing security software so as to be easily deployable within existing security ecosystems and to offload processing and computational work onto better suited components.  It can consume a wide variety of system and network security logs.  AttackTagger accomplishes advanced pattern matching by utilizing a Factor Graph model, which is a type of probabilistic graphical model that can describe complex dependencies among random variables using an undirected graph representation, specifically a bipartite graph. The bipartite graph representation consists of variable nodes representing random variables, factor nodes representing local functions (or factor functions , and edges connecting the two types of nodes. Variable dependencies in a factor graph are expressed using a global function, which is factored into a product of local functions. In the practice of the security domain, using factor graphs is more flexible to define relations among the events and the user state compared to Bayesian Network and Markov Random Field approaches. Specifically, using factor graphs allows capturing sequential relation among events and enables integration of the external knowledge, e.g., expert knowledge or a user profile.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS,1901 South First Street,Champaign,US,Champaign,IL13,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,IL,618207406,47.070,"['Ravishankar  Iyer', 'Randal L Butler', 'Zbigniew  Kalbarczyk', 'Adam J Slagell']",09/08/2015,041544081,499136,08/31/2019,4900,Software Institutes,499136,1535070,041544081,Alexander  Withers,506 S.

231,"This project further enables UCLA's computational research community by fusing the campus' Institute for Digital Research and Education (IDRE) Research Data Center with its second generation Science DMZ network. UCLA has maintained an innovative campus backbone network through implementation of a Science DMZ for over a decade. This approach has enabled high performance networking across campus and provides individual schools, departments, centers and laboratories to choose the level of connectivity that serves their specific needs and resources. This approach has ignited researcher demand for continuously increasing cyber infrastructure (CI) capability in compute, storage, visualization and both internal and external collaborative tools. In response, UCLA has designed and implemented its second generation, software defined networking capable (SDN), 40/100 gigabit Science DMZ network.

This project directly integrates the second generation Science DMZ with the IDRE Research Data Center, home of shared high performance research computing and storage on campus. Direct high capacity connectivity between researchers, local research instruments, the computational resources of the IDRE Research Data Center and external national and international resources and collaborators is integral to the next generation of research at UCLA. The set of UCLA research projects enabled by this work includes: molecular biologists manipulating raw sequencing data; genetics researchers sharing and archiving large data sets; and physicists running plasma simulations some of the country's largest supercomputers.

This connectivity is achieved via a high performance 40/100 gigabit layer 2 switching infrastructure. High performance Layer 2 network connectivity allows researchers to take full direct advantage of the network?s capacity while pushing slower elements like routing and security to the larger Science DMZ edge, where it is available, but only when needed.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES",10889 Wilshire Boulevard,LOS ANGELES,US,Los Angeles,CA33,University of California-Los Angeles,CA,900951406,47.070,,08/25/2015,092530369,500000,06/30/2018,4900,Campus Cyberinfrastrc (CC-NIE),500000,1541279,071549000,Scott A Friedman,,,US,Los Angeles,CA33,University of California-Los Angeles,CA,900951557,friedman@idre.ucla.edu,Scott,Friedman,A,3107940102,kthompso@nsf.gov,Kevin L. Thompson,7032928970,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"This project extended UCLA?s Research Data Center network into the campus? second generation Science DMZ network. This better positions UCLA researchers for future discovery by connecting its campus-wide computational and storage resources to regional, national and international collaborators and resources. The Research Data Center network?s previous configuration limited researchers in two ways. Its connection to the campus network is limited to 10Gbps, and its physical network hardware is nearing its end of life. The specific aim of this project was to remove both of these deficiencies by replacing the Research Data Center Network?s aging layer 3 centric core with a new layer 2 centric fabric integrated directly into the campus? Science DMZ network. This enabled the Research Data Center (RDC) network to connect researchers directly to both campus and external resources at anywhere between 1 and 100 Gbps.


The enabling benefits to science and engineering research at UCLA have been manifold. Significantly higher bandwidth and lower latency network allow productivity unimpeded by network bottlenecks. Sequencers and other scientific and engineering instruments are relentlessly becoming cheaper, faster, higher resolution and with less error. These devices, along with ever-increasing amounts of computational and storage capacity are now connected in a way that maximizes their value to research. As more and more data is generated in less time every year, efficient data movement is a requirement, and this project has provided that. In the first six months after full implementation over 67 petabytes of data has transited the network enabled by this project, an improvement of over two orders of magnitude from the network it replaced.


The merits of this project are, ultimately, what it enables more broadly to the researchers at UCLA. Providing access to the university's scalable and cost &shy;effective computational and storage resources directly through the UCLA Science DMZ network allows researchers to go beyond what they can accomplish within their own environments. Enhancing connectivity into the research data center ultimately enables and strengthens the productivity for the researchers who use the UCLA research data center and its network and the over $150 million in funding that directly supports their work.

232,"Across many Earth Science disciplines, research depends on the availability of representative samples collected above, at, and beneath Earth?s surface, on the moon and in space, or generated in experiments. These samples are fundamental references that are studied to generate new knowledge about the earth and the entire universe and a deeper understanding of the processes that created and shaped it, the availability of natural resources and the risk of natural hazards. Many samples have been collected at great cost and with substantial difficulty, are rare or unique and irreplaceable. The use of information technology and the internet to make these samples easily accessible, to ensure persistent access to relevant sample metadata, to allow unambiguous linking of the physical objects to the digital data in a distributed data infrastructure, will have a broad impact across the entire Earth Sciences. It will open new opportunities to reexamine existing samples in response to new societal issues, environmental concerns, scientific interpretations, and analytical techniques. The activities of this coordination network will allow domain scientists, curators, and computer and information scientists to learn from each other about the requirements of physical and digital sample and collection management and to articulate a vision of and a path forward toward an Internet of Samples in the Earth Sciences.

The EarthCube Research Coordination Network iSamplES (Internet of Samples in the Earth Sciences) is intended to advance the use of innovative cyberinfrastructure to connect physical samples and sample collections across the Earth Sciences with digital data infrastructures to revolutionize their utility for science. The ultimate goal of this RCN is to dramatically improve the discovery, access, sharing, analysis, and curation of physical samples and the data generated by their study for the benefit of science and society as part of the EarthCube program. In order to work toward this objective, the project will help build, grow, and foster domain scientists, curators of sample repositories and collections, computer and information scientists, software developers and technology innovators to engage in and collaborate on defining, articulating, and addressing the needs and challenges of physical samples as a critical component of digital data and information infrastructures (theme 1: socialization). The RCN will compile information about existing resources (technologies, architectures, tools, profiles, workflows) that facilitate the management of samples, sample collections, and sample-based data in the field, in the lab, in repositories, in data systems and scientific publications, and identify critical gaps and needs (theme 2: knowledge creation).

This grant supports a GEO EarthCube topical workshop with a focus on cyberinfrastructure issues germane to geological dating techniques and their digital publication.  The workshop seeks to engage approximately 70 geochronologists and geoscientists with the intent to: 1) develop a set of unifying requirements for the organization of geochronology data; and 2) explore methods for developing and sustaining an interactive community of domain and cyber-scientists to pursue next-generation solutions to the identified challenges.  The workshop will include invited talks followed by multiple breakout groups to discuss and produce draft documents focused on: 1) specific scientific challenges and opportunities in Geochronology over the next 5-15 years; 2) identification of the data and cyber-infrastructure obstacles to meeting those challenges; 3) a compilation of known community data and modeling resources; 4) description of data and cyber-capabilities required to meet challenges; and 5) development of ideas for at least two ?proof-of-concept? projects or test cases for scientifically transformative CI activities.

Nothing is more fundamental to understanding Earth history and processes than geochronology and the expense incurred in producing robust and high resolution dates implores NSF to help find a modern digital solution(s) for maintaining the integrity of these data sets and promoting access as broadly as possible in support of the advancement of the geosciences.

This is the first meeting in the U.S. that has brought together such a large spectrum of geochronologists, whose expertise spans from near-modern to early Earth timescales. We discussed the five NSF-prompted workshop goals below from within- as well as across-discipline perspectives. We recognized that the diverse geochronology communities share many common obstacles and needs, and that each sub-discipline is at various stages of envisioning and developing domain-specific organizational tools and cyberinfrastructure that would feed into a wider EarthCube framework.  There is also recognition that investment in cyberinfrastructure has the potential to improve access to high-quality dates, models, age calculation tools, and recalculation tools that will benefit geochronologists as well as the many end-users of geochronology data.
Grand Challenge:

Develop a fully integrated four-dimensional digital earth, of which geochronology provides the crucial fourth dimension, to fully understand dynamic earth system evolution.

Outcome 1: Science Drivers

The primary scientific driver identified during the workshop if EarthCube were successful would be to understand and test hypotheses about the underlying controls on, and the relationships between, major earth systems. Achievement of this goal will entail establishing:

?      a robust, unified chronological framework for all earth history;

?      correlation of earth system records across a range of nested spatio-temporal scales;

?      causality between forcing, responses and feedbacks, including leads and lags;

?      rates of change of fundamental earth system processes.

The above provides a general framework for the goals of the geochronologic community within EarthCube. Specific examples of scientific opportunities and challenges facing the geochronologic community over the next 15 years that will lead to resolution of the dynamic interactions among Earth systems include, but are not limited to:



?      the construction of a digital absolute geologic time scale used to resolve the times and drivers for biologic extinction as well as the  rates of biologic recovery and evolution;

?      the pace, magnitude and drivers of climate change through earth history (e.g., the carbon cycle, oxygen, sea level, ocean chemistry);

?      addition of a 4th dimension to the construction and evolution of the North American continent, providing knowledge products to be directly integrated with EarthScope data;

?      resolving interactions between rates, patterns, and magnitudes of erosion, landscape evolution, and sediment deposition, with climate change and tectonics in deep and more recent time.
Outcome 2: Data &amp; Cyberinfrastructure obstacles

?      Geochronological data are currently difficult to access, of variable quality, and challenging to compare between labs/methods and with other information;

?      Limited standardization of data acquisition, archiving and delivery protocols across the geochronologic  community;

?      The need to archive legacy data and develop mechanisms for managing the current data explosion, so that new and existing data can be leveraged;

?      Domain-specific data architectures are vastly incomplete or absent altogether and require the development and maintenance of software designed for the reduction and archiving of geochronologic data, designed to remain flexible for unanticipated data additions;

?      There is a lack of transformative technology for integrating earth system knowledge -- data at present are locked in domain-specific architectures;

?      It is difficult to recognize gaps and data deserts in existing datasets, and disconnects betwee...",,,08/01/2013,EarthCube domain end-user workshop:   Bringing Geochronology into the EarthCube framework,Grant
236,"Clouds abstractions and infrastructure are rapidly becoming part of the advanced research cyber-infrastructure (ACI) providing viable platforms for scientific exploration and discovery. As a result, it is important to understand how emerging data and compute intensive application workflows can effectively utilize a hybrid ACI integrating Cloud abstractions and services, and how such a hybrid ACI can enable new paradigms and practices in science and engineering. This EAGER explores innovative science and engineering application formulations that are enabled by a hybrid federated ACI that includes Clouds and HPC resources, as well as programming and middleware support for these new application formulations. Specifically, the project focuses on three key research thrusts: (1) application formulation; (2) programming models, abstractions and systems; and (3) middleware stacks and management services, and explore two applications use cases -- (i) an oil reservoir modeling application based on an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), and (ii) molecular dynamics simulations using asynchronous replica exchange. In each of these use cases activities explore how the capabilities provided by resources and services in a federated ACI can be leveraged to optimize metrics such as time-to-science, cost-to-science and/or energy-to-science.

Cloud services are integral to the NSF ACI vision. Clouds are also rapidly becoming an integral part of the ACI available to science and engineering applications, and provide complementary capabilities that can have a significant impact on a range of applications. As a result, this research can have a significant impact on a diverse set of application domains by identifying new paradigms and practices that can make effective use of a hybrid ACI to accelerate science. Furthermore, the results of this research will provide resource providers information about how to best meet the needs of science and engineering applications and how current ACI can achieve broader accessibility and higher efficiencies and productivity. The development of human resources, including the training of students, researchers and software professions, as well as outreach to minorities and underrepresented group, is integral to all aspects of this effort.",NSF,4900,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW JERSEY",33 Knightsbridge Road,Piscataway,US,Piscataway,NJ06,Rutgers University New Brunswick,NJ,088543925,47.070,"['Ivan  Rodero', 'Javier  Diaz-Montes']",06/07/2013,001912864,299984,05/31/2017,4900,CESER-Cyberinfrastructure for,299984,1339036,001912864,Manish  Parashar,94 Brett Road,Piscataway,US,Piscataway,NJ06,Rutgers Discovery Informatics Institute,NJ,088548058,parashar@rutgers.edu,Manish,Parashar,,8484455388,kthompso@nsf.gov,Kevin L. Thompson,7032928970,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The overarching goals of this project were to understand innovative science and engineering application formulations that are enabled by a hybrid federated ACI that includes clouds and HPC resources and to explore programming and middleware support that can enable these new application formulations.

First, we explored different usage models for the integration of clouds and HPC resources, namely HPC in the Cloud, HPC plus Cloud, and HPC as a Cloud. Next, we explored how a federation can be used to tackle large-scale engineering problems and demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach by federating ten geographically distributed HPC systems for a total of 2.5 million core-hours. This scale of federation enabled scientists to create the most comprehensive data on the effect of pillars on micro fluid channel flow. We also developed an algorithm that improves upon the default Reduce phase of the scheduling policy in Hadoop by making well-informed decisions about (a) when to start the Reduce phase for a job and (b) where to schedule the Reduce task. We also used our federation approach to enable the parallel execution of a cellular segmentation algorithm across multiple HPC resources, which provided 3 to 5-fold speedups to traditional approaches in the segmentation of large brain tumor images.

Further, we experimented with the use of a marketplace to enable the federation among multiple resource providers and used the framework to provide quality of service for streaming application by taking advantage of different vendors? price points and performance. We also explored the use of Software-defined Networks (SDNs) in a federation and used it to offer data-transfer QoS. These efforts were then applied to two different scientific areas, namely content-based image retrieval for cancer research; and study of how chromatin architecture affects gene expression in DNA sequences.

We also explored the use of in-transit computing and showed how in-transit resources could be used to process data along the data path, thereby reducing the computation time. The application of this approach was effective in the context of Smart Buildings, where we processed large amounts of data while optimizing both cost and energy. We also explored the application of software-defined environment concepts to infrastructure federation and created a rule-engine based software-defined federation.

Finally, we expanded our software-defined federation by leveraging constraint programming and software containers. This work provides near real-time adjustments to the federation in response to changing stimuli (e.g., changes in resource properties or availabilities, or the rules or constraints regulating their use). The resulting amorphous ecosystem is transparently exposed as a service to running applications. The ability to react and adapt to changes in the underlying infrastructure while the application is running can reduce cost and/or the time-to-solution for workloads. We evaluated our approach using a synthetic workflow simulating a Gleason-grading system for prostate pathology image analysis. We also demonstrated how our work allows users to programmatically and dynamically define multiple virtual slices of the same underlying resources, and adapt each slice over time without interrupting application execution. The workflow was encapsulated using Docker containers, which was then orchestrated to run across a federation of multiple IaaS clouds.

The research and development activities in this project  (1) enabled scientists to create the most comprehensive data to date on the effect of pillars on micro fluid channel flow; (2) was one of the first efforts to enable the deployment of Docker containers across multiple clouds; and (3) enabled the parallel execution of a cellular segmentation algorithm across multiple HPC resources, which provided 3 to 5-fold speedups to traditional approaches in the segmentation of large brain tumor images.

Forty (40) publications resulting from this effort have been published in major workshops, conferences, journals, and transactions. Additionally, the CometCloud open source software framework has been distributed to the community under the BSD open source license, and the framework documentation was also released under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License. Other achievements include a Best Paper Award Finalist, a Best Poster Award, a winner of the 2015 Cloud Challenge Award &ndash; Category 2, and a Best Student Paper Award.

This project has provided research and educational opportunities for students and researchers and has contributed to their academic work. It has also provided them the opportunity to collaborate with other researchers in academia and industry, to present their work at conferences and other meetings, to work with state of the art technologies, and to participate in software development and acquire related skills.

238,"This Project establishes a live OpenFlow (OF) test bed on the UCLA campus, which researchers in different disciplines will use to run experiments requiring high volume data exchange, intense processing, and/or seamless mobility as a production level service on the campus network.  UCLA will link the campus OF network to national OF fabrics via the regional CENIC OF network.  This pilot deployment will support four key applications from the domains of eScience, GENI and smart transportation, health care, and manufacturing.  The campus implementation support the above applications will consist of a 10Gbps OF-enabled hub switch connected to CENIC and multiple second-tier OF switches associated with the four projects.  

Although software-defined networking (SDN) technologies are currently being widely discussed and are key elements in the GENI architecture, there is little operational or campus-level architectural experience with using them.  The project will explore the issues associated with deploying SDNs and connecting them to real-time information sources.  The work will rework current UCLA network engineering practice where extensive hardware reconfiguration is required to support the sophisticated processing and efficient storage of data by several of the research centers.   Flexible reconfiguration is a new paradigm for campus networks.  The PIs will report on their experience in technical papers.   Travel budget is included for presentation of findings at the GENI Engineering Conferences.   


Broader Impact:
This project will provide an opportunity to gain experience with architectural, deployment, administrative and operational issues of OpenFlow in campus networks and will disseminate the findings via GENI Engineering Conferences.   The project will provide opportunities for undergraduate students to work with advanced networking technologies.

Over the period of three and half years we successfully deployed all the required equipment at five strategic locations around UCLA campus and performed various experiments and studies towards the original objectives of the project. The major experiments included 1) utilization of SDN capabilities within OpenStack to build out a prototype compute and storage capability that can be used as a starting point for secure protective/non-protective data based computations, and 2) deployment of Campus pilot testbed with using the concept of VSDN (Virtual Software Defined Network) and provide flexible support to mobile users.

Under our first major experiment, we are able to build a working prototype of an infrastructure that will allow us to provide HPC compute and storage resources for protected (HIPAA) and non-protected (non-HIPAA) data in a combined and secure manner. This infrastructure was leveraged from our DOE and NIST grants for Smart Manufacturing where we used SDN to create a secure and separate network for protected data. As a result, the movement of the protected data from secure resources into the compute and storage environment and then back to secure resources or saved out to archival storage was demonstrated.

Our team was also able to develop and demonstrate the concept of VSDN (Virtual Software Defined Network) via a Campus pilot testbed in order to achieve the second major goal. The VSDN allowed the maintenance of multiple Virtual Networks on top of an SDN managed infrastructure in the Access Network of the Campus Backbone. Further, we successfully used VSDN concept to examine the feasibility of building a secure campus Internet of Things (IoT) or in other words the concept of a Smart Campus.  

The research/results have been published in the form of publications and presentations in major journals and symposiums.

239,"Collaborative Research: Building analytical, synthesis, and human network skills needed for
macrosystem science: a next generation graduate student training model based on GLEON

Ecology is on the cusp of new continental-scale science. Enabled by emerging science networks, there is now a tremendous promise for understanding the effects and consequences of global environmental change on ecological systems across regions and among continents. Data from environmental sensor networks, as well as ever-growing, publically available data from research and monitoring programs around the world will underpin this understanding. However, scientific advances require people who can make creative use of technology and data, and who can work together to promote transdisciplinary understanding. Tackling large scale science will require a generation of scientists trained to work in teams to effectively use/create the cyber infrastructure necessary to deliver relevant data, to explore, analyze and synthesize those data using a variety of techniques and tools, and to communicate their findings to the scientific community and the public.

The creation of a Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) Graduate Student Fellows Program (GGSFP) is proposed to build the essential skills necessary for a new generation of scientists to quickly assume productive roles in macrosystem syntheses, and network science organizations. GLEON is an international, grassroots network of scientists, information technology experts, and engineers who have a common goal of building a scalable, persistent network of lake ecology observatories (www.gleon.org). GLEON has over 300 members (95 students) from 34 countries and has multiple data repositories, including near-continuous high frequency data from lakes. This work will combine the extensive resources and experience of GLEON with expertise in pedagogy, organizational sociology, leadership training, and assessment to create an innovative training program. Two cohorts of fellows, along with their advisors, will participate in a series of 5 collaboratories that form its core. Asking and answering continental-scale questions will be the scientific goal. A final workshop with other major network education colleagues will help communicate successes and lessons learned to other Ecological Observatory Networks. Dozens of additional students will participate in shorter training sessions through GLEON all hands meetings. Central to this training program will be (1) development of technical, conceptual and analytical skills critical to carrying out macroscale biology and network science, (2) development of communication skills for collaboration, education and public outreach, (3) active participation in existing networks of people, data, and technologies, and perhaps most important (4) training and guidance by experts in how to build and sustain human networks through pedagogy, organizational structure, and leadership training. Ongoing assessments will be used to refine the program and to measure success and guide future programs.

Broader Impacts: The GLEON GGSFP will develop scientists' capabilities to build and maintain the human infrastructure that is necessary to understand complex environmental system function under global change. Students will emerge from the program with significant skills in working within and utilizing networks of people, infrastructure, data and equipment, and the ability to ask and answer complex, large scale questions. Dozens of students will be engaged through GLEON, and intensive, focused training for two cohorts of ten fellows will be provided. Student cohorts will be selected to reflect gender, cultural and disciplinary diversity balance, following the practices fostered, and lessons learned with the GLEON Graduate Student Association. Coincident with the development of students will be a training exemplar for the ecological community. The outcomes and impact of this program will be extended throughout the community via web-distribution of collaboratory training and through social networking tools. In addition, primary graduate student advisors will experience new training models and tools; fellows will develop a network of mentors in addition to those at their home institution; and fellows and primary advisors, together, will develop outreach materials and/or curricula. Advances in scientific understanding through peer reviewed publications, including those having to do with organizational management will also result. The program will become part of the infrastructure of GLEON, providing new expertise in pedagogy, organizational theory, and leadership training, resulting in continued production of a highly trained work force with the dimensionality required to realize the promise of network science.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SYSTEM,21 North Park Street,MADISON,US,Madison,WI02,University of Wisconsin-Madison,WI,537151218,47.074,,12/13/2011,161202122,703353,09/30/2018,4900,MACROSYSTEM BIOLOGY,843246,1137353,041188822,Paul C Hanson,"21 N Park St, Suite 6401",Madison,US,Madison,WI02,University of Wisconsin-Madison,WI,537151218,pchanson@wisc.edu,Paul,Hanson,C,6083205322,eblood@nsf.gov,Elizabeth R.

241,"Native American tribal governments and public educators in UT, AZ and NM have developed a new creative and accelerated means to propel forward a broad spectrum of much-needed Information Technology (IT) education and training. Their goal is to benefit adult citizenry and K-16 student populations to meet escalating college preparatory and regional/tribal workforce demands for 21st century digital job-ready IT skills. Utah Valley University (UVU), led by a team of experienced student success researchers, mentors and Native American K-12 educational specialists, have joined with global IT industry certification and training leaders to create an innovative, research-based cyber learning environment capable of realistically meeting the specific educational challenges faced by the traditionally underserved Native American communities and individuals with a 2 year integrated research and leaning project. The Native American Regional IT Industry Workforce Development Project (NA-CIT) builds upon best practices and lessons learned from a previous 2008-10 CI-TEAM demonstration project in order to accomplish its major objectives. This multi-state program, managed across institutions and a broad range of IT disciplines, deploys a synergized, culturally-relevant online delivery (Web 2.0) methodology coupled with stringent process assessment and mentored support mechanisms to maximize participant learning\success rates and outcomes. 

A classroom and CI (hardware/software) were previously in place at the three primary training hubs: Central/Southeast Utah, Holbrook, AZ and Window Rock/Ft. Defiance on the Navajo Nation. Accomplishment of the objectives of this project portends to have far- reaching effect toward making cyber-technology more accessible to the Native American youth and young adults (age 12-50) and in opening doors for them to contribute directly to society as scientists, engineers, educators, and community leaders. NA-CIT is training between 400-500 participants over a 24 month project period. 

The proposed demonstration project is: (1) Organizing and implementing a synergistic CI enabled instructional delivery support system (high-tech) with local counselors, mentors and teachers (high-touch) and students at 3 regional locations both via the internet and within technology-assisted classroom, teacher-led and peer-mentor supported environments, and (2) Assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of the above described synergistic approach in bringing the participants to a high level average validated competency within a broad spectrum of workplace ready skill-sets (from basic computer fundamentals to higher orders of competency in web-design, network administration/support and programming e.g. - MS.Net and Linux.Net). All programs are implemented with a view to extending a similar approach to possible future full degree level programs in the IT field, and to making this comprehensive learning system scalable and replicable to other Indigenous educational environments. 

Broader Impacts: This implementation project will provide a model for the scientific, engineering, and technology education of many indigenous, rural, and other minority populations throughout the world that do not have easy access to learning in these fields. Because all of the instruction and proposed coursework has a sound integrated design, a positive experience with this select population will have broad implications for similarly deployed online and/or mentored classroom IT educational environments. The probability of the success of this project is enhanced by the groundwork and physical cyber-infrastructure work that is already in place and by the cooperative efforts with companies and educational experts who have already accomplished a great deal in the technical education of the students within this demographic. 

Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this project is not so much in the development of the individual components as it is in the combining of all the components to provide an immersive learning environment with learning activities, student tracking, hands-on mentoring and assessment practices that will engages and motivates the students in the course to reach a high level of competency in the subject matter area at the completion of the coursework. The infusion of CI-enabled environments and curricula with strategies based on a Native American philosophical and cosmological paradigm that influences the way Native Americans think and learn is based on current educational research and adds to the complexity and merit of the project.",NSF,4900,UTAH VALLEY UNIVERSITY,800 West University Parkway,Orem,US,,UT03,Utah Valley University,UT,840585999,47.070,"['James A Stanger', 'Stephen M McSweeney', 'Christopher  Goslin']",08/23/2010,073076952,873868,09/30/2013,4900,CI-TEAM,873868,1041410,073076952,Richard  Mosholder,800 West University Parkway,Orem,US,,UT03,Utah Valley University,UT,840585999,rmoshold@kennesaw.edu,Richard,Mosholder,,7707947866,achtchel@nsf.gov,Almadena Y.

Title:  Developing the IT and College Readiness Skills of Native Americans

In an NSF-sponsored project, educational psychologists at the Utah Valley University working with members of the Native American community have developed techniques to recruit members of this historically underserved group and to encourage them through mentoring to achieve their training and development goals.  Since the inception of the project on 10/1/10, we have enrolled over 2200 people.  Almost 1700 people have reached milestones in training with 927 achieving ""high stakes"" IT certifications and another 892 earning certificates generated by the training software in recognition of demonstrated expertise.  Of those achieving ""high stakes"" certifications, 663 received entry level IT certifications with 381 completing all three sections of the entry level IT certificate protocol.  Another 264 achieved an advanced IT or QuickBooks certification. One hundred and seventy six of the ""high stakes"" certifications were achieved during the extension period.

These numbers compare favorably with the goals we set when we wrote the grant and projected that we would certify 450 people with 80% of those achieving basic certifications.  A secondary goal was to change the perception of the Native Americans about our institution and increase enrollment and retention. We accomplished that by developing curricula and programming that demonstrated that Native American culture and tradition are valued.  During the period of the grant, the Native American student population increased 56% to 512.  Year to year retention for this group increased from below 50% to 64%, about the same as the entire student body.

 The results are significant because Native American students are the most likely racial/ethnic group tracked in post-secondary American education to be affected by poverty and limited access to educational opportunities.  In addition, they are the most likely to be required to take remedial course work and are the least likely to graduate from college.

 A major challenge to be overcome in accomplishing educational objectives with Native Americans is overcoming cultural incongruity (Mosholder and Goslin, in press).  Until the late 1960s, assimilation of Native Americans was both the stated objective of the United States government and the assumed goal of the education establishment.  Native language use and the practice of Native traditions were seen as impediments to economic development.  Hence, mainstream education has been seen as the enemy by many Native American groups and they are often resistant to programs that are developed for them as opposed to with them.  In addition, indigenous cultures are typically collectivist, with holistic rather than individual goals, and have world views that militate towards conservation rather than exploitation. 

We are guided in our work by the framework of culturally responsive pedagogy and thus assume that improving the relationship of the Native American community external to UVU will positively impact recruitment and persistence of Native American students inside the University.  Free IT training and mentoring by students inside the institution serves to improve this relationship and to improve overall economic conditions.  Thus, among the major activities of the grant are the development of networks characterized by cultural acceptance, social currency, and individuals willing to engage and the development of engaging curricula and mentoring processes with valued outcomes delivered within mentored learning communities. 

 In order to obtain the resources and community connections necessary to accomplish the grant goals, we have worked with Native American student researchers to create partnerships with the Navajo Nation, the Piute Tribe, the Holbrook, Arizona school district and the software traini...",,"['Mosholder, R.& Goslin, C.~Encouraging Native American college student persistence~Journal of College Student Retention: Research, Theory & Practice~15~2013~305~~0895033313~0~ ~0~ ~21/11/2015 06:57:32.546000000', 'Mosholder, R.

242,"The Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC) and the City College of New York (CCNY) are collaborating on the development of workshops on the scientific method and data analysis skills to supplement methods courses for pre-service science teachers. The project goals are to incorporate computer-based data analysis into junior level methods courses for middle and high school pre-service teachers, to better prepare secondary school students for the STEM workforce via teacher preparation, to enable pre-service teachers to introduce current scientific research and data analysis in secondary school classrooms, and to increase the number of minority students pursuing careers in science teaching.

The project supports a two-day jump start workshop, modified weekly seminars, bi-weekly professional development workshops, and a two-week summer program to train pre-service teachers to access and use online scientific databases. Pre-service teachers are mentored by in-service teachers as they learn to develop research questions and hypotheses, which are tested using publicly available databases in biology, genetics, bioinformatics, geology, and engineering. Virtual experiments are conducted using the University of Colorado's Virtual Chemistry Laboratory. Pre-service teachers next engage in an internship and fieldwork as they assist secondary students with the design of Science Exit Projects which are required for graduation. 

The project evaluation examines teacher preparation and training, as well as the application of on-line database resources in the classroom setting by measuring attitudes, behavior, and activities of students and teachers. Outcomes will be disseminated via journal publications, conference presentations, and websites on each partnering institution's webpage. Additional outreach targets education faculty at the other community colleges in the CUNY system. This two-year project will reach 129 science teachers (pre-service and in-service).

Denniston,7032928670,040106 NSF Education & Human Resource,"Project Summary

Our project was as successful as we could have been in meeting our goals.  We successfully recruited science majors from BMCC and encouraged them to consider pursuing science education as a possible career goal.  At least two of these students continued on to CCNY and received bachelorÆs degrees in science education.  Our students worked with high school and middle school teachers to introduce the skills of the scientific method into the classroom through the mechanism of cyber learning.  We revised the syllabi for courses in the masters program in science education at CCNY and now scientific inquiry through cyber learning if a permanent part of that curriculum.  We also dispersed our findings and method through national conferences and workshops for other CUNY faculty.

            The project was not without difficulties.  We had initially intended to use the Teacher Academy at BMCC and CCNY as a recruiting source for students, but this program lost funding before our own began.  Since we were unable to find a role that Everton Barrett, the director of the Teacher Academy at BMCC, was capable of doing he left the project as did Lorraine Whitman who accepted an administrative position outside of CUNY.  We therefore brought in students from BMCC and CCNY who had worked with us to act as recruiters and they did a fine job of going to science classes at BMCC to sell our program to students.  Thanks to their efforts we were able to get enough students to run the program every semester in spite of the relatively small stipend we offered. 

            One important finding we made in the process of teaching our seminars was that students at BMCC, and even many who were receiving or had received masterÆs degrees in science education, were ignorant of the scientific method.  Many science teachers had even been taught to teach their students to ""prove"" their hypotheses.  We therefore ended up spending a large proportion of our seminar time teaching the scientific method and helping our participants develop the skills they need to ask appropriate scientific questions.  The time not spent on the scientific method was spent on the pedagogy of employing it in the middle school classroom and both our pre-service and in-service teachers reported that this worked very well.

            We presented our methods and results in several forums; the annual ATE conference, the education section of the American Chemical Society annual meeting and a CUNY wide seminar.  In all cases we received excellent feedback and were greeted with positive sentiments about introducing novel inquiry to the middle school classroom through the use of cyber infrastructure.  Many people gave us good ideas and suggestions to improve our work and we are appreciative of the learning opportunities afforded to us by these interactions.  We are currently working on developing a publication based on the results of our work.

            Overall the program was well worthwhile.  Although it is too early to see long-term results we are hopeful that the work we have begun here will lead to a greater understanding of science by science teachers in the schools we worked with and that it will be the germ of a movement that will become widespread in the academic community.

243,"The project is designed to address simultaneously the need of acquiring additional professional experience in informatics in order to advance research in the history and philosophy of science (HPS) and to open up new areas of research and investigation at the intersection of these two areas. As more and more texts, images, and archival sources become available in digital form, history and philosophy of science, and the humanities more generally, are now experiencing a transformation similar to the life sciences during the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century. While these trends are inevitable, researchers in these areas are ill-prepared to take advantage of the new opportunities or to shape the future development of relevant parts of the emerging new cyberinfrastructure. The post-doc's training in biology and HPS, as well as his work on the NSF funded Embryo Project, has given him a unique perspective on the possibilities and challenges of the upcoming digital era in HPS. With the fellowship he will spend time training with computer scientists and informaticians at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA, as well as the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin. He will acquire new skills related to developing this cyberinfrastructure, which will then be tested and implemented in the context of the Embryo Project. This professional training fellowship will go beyond supporting research in HPS as the tools and techniques developed will contribute substantially to the digital humanities at large. Presenting HPS related results and information to a multitude of different user groups has enormous educational and outreach possibilities as well, and this depends on a substantially developed cyber-infrastructure to deliver this scholarly content to students, policy makers, judges, and the interested public.",NSF,4900,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY,ORSPA,TEMPE,US,Tempe,AZ09,Arizona State University,AZ,852816011,47.075,"['Grant J Yamashita', 'John B Howard']",09/03/2009,943360412,84066,08/31/2012,4900,"SCIENCE, TECH & SOCIETY",84066,0926026,806345658,Manfred  Laubichler,ORSPA,TEMPE,US,Tempe,AZ09,Arizona State University,AZ,852816011,manfred.laubichler@asu.edu,Manfred,Laubichler,,4809655481,fkronz@nsf.gov,Frederick M Kronz,7032927283,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,"['Goddard, A, P.

244,"As the Internet evolves into a global communication infrastructure, 
it is becoming complex and ubiquitous. It is bringing together 
heterogeneous collections of hosts and network devices such as 
wireless mesh networks. A consequence of this ever-increasing 
scale, complexity and agility is that problems of managing this 
infrastructure keep getting worse. Research concentrating on 
streamlining fundamental issues has shown that absence of a single 
end-to-end lightweight hybrid network management solution with the 
necessary levels of context awareness and adaptability, while much 
desirable, has not yet been realized.  Consequently, the community 
is still detained from fully gaining from many of the emerging 
applications of the cyber-infrastructure.  

This research involves an exploratory investigation towards a 
?drive through? network management platform for ?on-the-fly? 
Internet-enabled mobile networks. Objectives include new conceptual 
approaches that couple application, and middleware designs with design 
of network management services; novel theoretical models that tap into 
in-network management characteristics of pervasive computing so that 
missing or conflicting information gathered from multiple participating 
nodes can be tolerated; augmentation of security management algorithms 
with trustworthiness functionalities; theoretical schemes that examine 
epistemic uncertainty by fusing imprecision, uncertainty and event 
synchronization with belief theory; and extensions to archetype 
platforms for supporting autonomic network management and configuration.  
The intellectual merit of the research lies in presenting a first step 
towards synthesis of integrated network management theoretical and design 
solutions that support traditional network management protocols and 
functionalities in addition to the dynamic aspects of infrastructures-less

In particular, in collaboration with team from UT Arlington, Penn State University and the University of Kentucky, the project will create a novel technology-enabled security framework, called Pervasively Secure Infrastructures (PSI), that will make use of such advanced technologies as smart sensors, wireless networks, pervasive computing, mobile agents, data mining, and profile-based learning in an integrated, collaborative and distributed manner. The uniqueness of this multi-disciplinary, multi-university proposal lies in the synergistic combination of the proposed research in (i) efficient data collection and aggregation from heterogeneous sensors and monitors; (ii) novel techniques for real-time, secured, authenticated information transmission and sharing, and (ii) intelligent situation awareness (e.g., threat detection and security services) through new learning, data mining, and knowledge discovery techniques.

Description:  This project is to support a US-Morocco Workshop on ""Digital Archives for the Maghreb Region of Africa"" to be held January 25-28, 2007 in Rabat, Morocco.  The U.S. organizer is Eric S. Howard, The Fulbright Academy of Science and Technology, Cape Elizabeth, Maine.  The foreign collaborators are Dr. Khalid Temsmani, Dr. El Majid Zayer and Dr. Ilhame Laaziz, all from the Directorate of Technology, Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research in Rabat, Morocco.  A primary goal of the workshop is to develop a vision and mission statement for a digital initiative covering the Maghreb region (i.e., Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia). The meeting will bring together key constituents so that this vision can be realized: content development, management structures, networked infrastructure, research and educational applications, and training for digital managers and users. The findings will be incorporated in a report and plan of action that can inform government agencies, libraries, universities, research institutes and grant-making entities. US researchers and students will be involved in the process. Their role will be to review the background papers from the January 2006 Alexandria, Egypt workshop on the digital library and digital infrastructure, and to prepare additional ones to fill critical gaps in our knowledge as it relates to the Maghreb region. Representatives from North African countries as well as UNESCO are expected to attend.  

Intellectual merit:   Efforts to extend and enhance internet connectivity and content access to the Maghreb region are long overdue.  The proposal, building on the earlier workshop in Alexandria takes another important step forward toward building a regional resource, connecting to the global knowledge environment that will serve multiple purposes including advancing research capacity and educational resources.  The success of this long-term process is dependent upon social and organizational actions as much as upon technology advances.  The workshop is to connect important players throughout the region and to build linkages to high-speed networks and governance structures in the developed world.  It will identify existing regional efforts and prompt new efforts to collect, organize and make generally available materials related to the cultural heritage of the region, which is significant for US scientists. The Fulbright Academy of Science and Technology has the expertise and experience to organize the meeting and disseminate its findings to a large audience. 

Broader Impact:  Access to digital information in developing countries is a critical issue of international concern. The World Summit on the Information Society in Tunisia in the fall of 2005 significantly enhanced the interest of entities in Northern Africa with respect to the digital world.  This workshop is an important step in the efforts to include North Africa in the global mainstream of scientific and educational communication which involves co-sharing of globally distributed digital content.  One area of interest is a digital archive, the creation of a networked digital library covering the cultural heritage of the Maghreb region to facilitate access to related cultural heritage resources held by different institutions around the world.  The workshop will promote a broader discussion of the potential of digital libraries to advance knowledge and to foster international cooperation.  It should result in dialogues, new discourse communities, intellectual programs of research and scholarship and coordinated infrastructure building. US junior scientists and graduate students are expected to participate in the workshop.

Much of what we know about biological evolution, episodes of severe climate change, and the evolution of our oceans and atmospheres is recorded in the geological record.  However, geological records in any one geographical area are incomplete.  Thus, to establish a detailed history of the planet we must integrate records from across the entire planet using a combination of the fossil record and the dating of rocks (geochronology).  Our ability to determine the age of rocks has improved dramatically over the past twenty years and calculated uncertainties have been reduced from about 1% to 0.1 %.   With increased precision has come the opportunity to explore very small differences in time and small but systematic differences between laboratories and different geochronological techniques.  These differences by no means threaten the validity of the techniques but are a consequence of a level of precision never thought possible. A necessary step in the further development of understanding earth history using high-precision geochronology is the establishment of a coordinated infrastructure and analytical facilities necessary for the achievement of high-resolution ""sequencing"" of at least the last 800 million years of earth history in the next decade.  We propose to develop a cyberinfrastructure, the EarthTime Network, that will unite geochronology labs around the world in terms of analytical protocol and the reporting of standards so that we will eliminate or further reduce small systematic differences between labs and techniques.  We will combine this with an aggressive program of education and public outreach focused on both earth scientists as well as the general public.  Our goal is to understand the changes our planet has undergone over the past 4.56 billion years so as to better predict our future.",NSF,4900,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,77 MASSACHUSETTS AVE,Cambridge,US,Cambridge,MA07,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,MA,021394301,47.050,,05/06/2005,001425594,,04/30/2011,4900,INSTRUMENTATION & FACILITIES,1285862,0451802,001425594,Samuel A Bowring,77 MASSACHUSETTS AVE,Cambridge,US,Cambridge,MA07,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,MA,021394301,sbowring@mit.edu,Samuel,Bowring,A,6172533775,dlambert@nsf.gov,David Lambert,7032928558,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,"['Schoene, B. and Bowring S.A.~U/Pb systematics of the McClure Mountain syenite: thermochronological constraints on the \nage of the 40Ar/39Ar standard MMhb~Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology~151 (5)~2006~615~~~0~ ~0~ ~21/11/2015 06:57:32.546000000', 'Jackson, J.

249,"Computer simulation methods based on Molecular Dynamics (MD) have been used for decades to understand chemical and biochemical phenomena at the molecular level. MD is a very powerful tool that has enabled scientists to understand the behavior of molecules crucial for life such as proteins and nucleic acids. MD has also been used to understand diseases and develop new drugs. However, MD is limited in both the size of the systems that can be studied and the amount of time that can be simulated. Many complex phenomena relevant to life involve systems too large to study with MD, or require following the system for much longer times. An alternative to traditional MD called discontinuous molecular dynamics (DMD) has been shown to be much more efficient to study biomolecular processes. To date, however, the use of DMD has been limited due to its inability to take advantage of modern parallel computers. This project will develop a next-generation parallel DMD software that will enable the study of complex molecular phenomena involving larger systems and longer time scales. Detailed knowledge of such processes will considerably advance the development of new materials and drugs, and human health.  The project team combines the computational and experimental expertise to successfully develop and validate a robust parallel DMD software framework. The software and results will be actively shared both with the computational simulation community and with the scientific and engineering community at large, contributing to the capability, capacity, and cohesiveness of the national cyber-infrastructure ecosystem. Furthermore, the results of this project will be used in outreach efforts geared toward the education and inclusion of minorities traditionally underrepresented in higher STEM education.


This project aims to develop an open software framework that enables multi-millisecond dynamic simulations of peptides and peptide-mimetics by implementing a parallel discontinuous molecular dynamics (DMD) package. Unlike current molecular dynamics (MD), which features limited simulation timescales, discontinuous molecular dynamics (DMD) assumes ballistic motion of the particles between interaction events and enables the study of phenomena across much longer time scales. To demonstrate the approach, the project will (1) develop a parallel version of existing serial DMD codes to enable extending simulation times from hundreds of microseconds to several milliseconds; (2) extend and improve the available DMD peptide force field, adding parameters for non-natural peptides and peptoids; and (3) develop software for translating interaction potentials from traditional MD to DMD. The project team possesses the complementary expertise necessary for this project, including coarse-grained models and force fields for complex polymers and peptoids, MD simulation of protein self-assembly and peptide-protein binding processes, synthesis of protein-binding peptides and peptoids, and measurement of thermodynamic and kinetic binding parameters. The tools resulting from this research will allow the scientific and engineering community to model and study very long time-scale phenomena, such as biopolymer folding, aggregation and inhibition of aggregation, fibril formation, and protein-binding. This toolbox shows great promise to not only accelerate innovation in the computational design of biomaterials, but also to impact the molecular simulation community focusing on highly complex systems, up to cell-level dynamics. Notably, this project is ideal for the National Science Foundation's Cyber-infrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI), as it (i) contributes to the capability, capacity, and cohesiveness of the national cyberinfrastructure ecosystem by providing user-friendly open-source computational tools, (ii) actively engages CI experts and testers of our toolbox, who would potentially be its ultimate users, (iii) advances our current capabilities in developing bioactive peptides and peptoids, (iv) establishes plans and metrics that encourage measurement of progress and certify the quality of shared tools and results, and (iv) devise strategies to combine wide-access with long-term community-driven development and progress.

250,"Electronic computing hardware forms the foundation of modern information systems and cyber infrastructure. However, the unavoidable involvement of untrusted parties  who can insert malicious circuits (i.e., hardware Trojans), steal intellectual property (IP), and produce counterfeits have made hardware more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. National defense, welfare, and economic growth all suffer through 1) weaker security and quality of critical infrastructures; 2) substantial economic and reputational losses for IP owners; 3) increased revenue for terrorist groups, criminals, and adversarial nation states; and 4) lower incentive to innovate and develop new products. The objective of this project is to advance the state-of-the-art in hardware obfuscation for IP protection. Hardware obfuscation refers to transformation of a circuit design into one that is functionally equivalent to the original, but infeasible to reverse engineer and/or obtain unrestricted use without significant effort. 

This project targets four major limitations associated with existing hardware obfuscation techniques: 1) Impractical overheads for real-world designs; 2) Susceptibility to attacks; 3) Poor scalability to large circuits of practical interest; and 4) lack of metrics and benchmarks in the research community to objectively compare different methods. Efficiency and scalability are being improved by developing novel circuit entropy metrics and holistic obfuscation algorithms that operate on decision diagrams. Outreach activities dedicated to obfuscation and awareness of IP piracy issues include creation of the first publically available benchmarks, conducting online global competitions, and generating new course materials, projects, and book. Through integration of these activities, measureable improvements in the attack resistance of obfuscated combinational and sequential designs are expected by project's end.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,1 UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,GAINESVILLE,US,Gainesville,FL03,University of Florida,FL,326112002,47.070,,05/24/2017,969663814,399893,05/31/2022,4900,Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace,161996,1651701,159621697,Domenic  Forte,1 University of Florida,Gainesville,US,Gainesville,FL03,University of Florida,FL,326112002,dforte@ece.ufl.edu,Domenic,Forte,,3523921525,skundu@nsf.gov,Sandip Kundu,7032928950,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,"['Amir, Sarah and Shakya, Bicky and Xu, Xiaolin and Jin, Yier and Bhunia, Swarup and Tehranipoor, Mark and Forte, Domenic~Development and Evaluation of Hardware Obfuscation Benchmarks~Journal of Hardware and Systems Security~2~2018~~~10.1007/s41635-018-0036-3~10061542~142 to 161~10061542~OSTI~25/06/2018 15:01:46.760000000']",06/01/2017,"CAREER: Transformative Approaches for Hardware Obfuscation Protection, Attacks, and Assessment",Grant

Together these Hispanic-Serving institutions will work to adapt proven strategies that have positive impact on (1) the number of Hispanic students who enter the workforce with computing degrees; (2) the retention and advancement of Hispanic students and faculty in computing, and (3) the development of sustainable, competitive education and research programs. 

To accomplish this, CAHSI has already implemented a number of programs, including Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) that creates an active learning experience for students and leadership experiences for undergraduates serving as peer leaders, the Affinity Research Group (ARG) model that emphasizes the deliberate and intentional development of technical, team and professional skills and knowledge required for research, and Mentor-Grad that engages undergraduates in experiences and activities that prepare them for graduate studies and the professoriate. CAHSI has a strong record of success: recent bachelor's graduation rates of Hispanics in computer science increased by nearly 25% within their member institution, while over the same time period, the national trend showed a 39% decline. This extension will further existing goals and intentionally develop a sustainable ecosystem to (1) institute a sustainable infrastructure that supports CAHSI's continued impact and (2) become recognized as an organization that affects decision-making and cultural change at the local, regional, and national levels. To achieve these goals CAHSI will establish the cyber infrastructure to support collaborations and dissemination of CAHSI practices, establish collaborations beyond the Alliance with organizations and institutions sharing common goals, and promote multicultural awareness in administrators, faculty, and students.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT EL PASO,ADMIN BLDG RM 209,El Paso,US,El Paso,TX16,University of Texas at El Paso,TX,799680001,47.070,"['Malek  Adjouadi', 'Mohsen  Beheshti', 'Nayda G Santiago', 'Enrico  Pontelli PhD']",08/31/2016,132051285,3841960,09/30/2021,4900,Computing Ed for 21st Century,3995406,1551221,042000273,Ann Q Gates,,,US,El Paso,TX16,University of Texas at El Paso,TX,799680001,agates@utep.edu,Ann,Gates,Q,9157477689,jcuny@nsf.gov,Janice E.

252,"Food safety and procurement policies that focus on local producers can prevent foodborne illness outbreaks and are an important component of a healthy food environment. Food safety policies such as the New York (NY) Food Metric require some traceability, meaning the revealing of information and processes of the origin, location, and life history of a product across the supply-chain. However, the costs of participating in a traceability cyber infrastructure could potentially nullify the economic benefits of food safety policy implementation for small farms. Data and technology requirements and capabilities have the potential to marginalize small farms who have restricted capability, time, and resources to collect, record, and share data. In partnership with Professor Gary Kleppel and the Kleppel Lab for Agricultural Ecology and Sustainable Food Production in the Department of Biology at the University at Albany (UAlbany), the Center for Technology in Government, UAlbany proposes to build preliminary data and technology architectures to support the development of the necessary cyber-infrastructure for a whole-chain traceability system that fits with the data capabilities of small farms. 

The focus of this research is to design data and technology architectures that fit with the capabilities of small farms. Data collection will include a series of in-depth interviews with selected small farmers and government officials in NY?s Capital District and representatives of UAlbany, which will serve as the institutional buyer. The research team will use qualitative analysis of the interview data to identify the critical factors needed to design appropriate technology and data architectures for small farms.

Tracking the journey a food product takes from its origin to the dinner table is difficult. However, it is important to trace food products every step of the way to ensure each product is free of food-borne illness and for economic development purposes.

Our team at CTG UAlbany explored the unique characteristics of small farmers as food producers in New York?s Capital Region, plus the potential benefits and challenges of food traceability with funding from a National Science Foundation Early-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research.

Our researchers partnered with Biology Professor Gary Kleppel from the Kleppel Lab for Agricultural Ecology and Sustainable Food Production at the University at Albany for this study.

Based on in-depth interviews with small local farmers, non-profits, food distributors, institutional buyers, and key government managers and policy makers our team identified enablers and barriers affecting small farmers? willingness and ability to participate in a food traceability system.

UAlbany Biology and Public Administration undergraduate and graduate students conducted interviews, analyzed data, and helped publish results throughout the process.

Thanks to the data gathered and analysis of it, our research team developed a preliminary framework that could help to develop the data and technology architecture needed for food traceability. The framework includes data specifications, policies, and governance elements that could help build an effective food traceability system between small farms and consumers.

Findings from this project were presented at the 2018 Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences and published in the conference proceedings.

253,"Thermal radiation is an important but less adequately understood heat transfer process for large-scale thermal systems. Radiative heat transfer accounts for more than 70% of the total heat transfer to the ambient environment in large-scale fires. Pollutants that are produced by combustion systems, such as particulate matters, NOx and SOx (main contributor to acid rain), are highly sensitive to the thermal effects of radiative heat transfer. To correctly predict fire propagation and pollutant emission, and to guide power plant retrofit, high-fidelity radiation modeling for large-scale combustion systems is needed. However, the expensive computational cost of high-fidelity radiation models, their intensive memory requirements, and poor scaling performances have traditionally prevented their applications beyond toy or small-scale problems. Modern high performance computing systems have evolved to a stage where massive parallelism can be harnessed but memory-per-core is decreasing. Therefore, new modeling and parallelism strategies for thermal radiation prediction are required to leverage the power of current and future cyber-infrastructure. To advance the understanding of the thermal radiation processes, and to enable the application of predictive models to practical engineering systems, this CRII project aims at optimizing the solution algorithms and parallelism strategies of high-fidelity radiation models for the modern heterogeneous many-core high performance computing systems.  Therefore, this research aligns with the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare.

The overarching goal of this project is to break the barrier of applying high-fidelity radiation models to practical large-scale systems, utilizing modern cyber-infrastructure. As a result, the heat flux on the computational boundaries as well as pollutant emissions can be better predicted, which can reduce the fire loss and alleviate the environmental concerns with pollutions. Specifically, the project focuses on enhancing the parallelism of a Monte Carlo based high-fidelity radiation model, using the hybrid computing environment provided by the many-integrated-core (MIC) co-processors. As proposed, the high-fidelity radiation model will be coupled to an open-source fire simulator, and will be validated against well-documented experimental data. By identifying the disparate time scales of different physical processes, solution algorithm is first optimized to enhance the overall efficiency of the proposed code. Hybrid parallelism with message passing interface (MPI) and OpenMP is then proposed to achieve the desired reduction in the ""time to solution."" Finally, the accuracy and efficiency of the developed fire-radiation code will be demonstrated through a large-scale fire simulation.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT,438 Whitney Road Ext.,Storrs,US,Storrs Mansfield,CT02,University of Connecticut,CT,062691133,47.070,,06/15/2016,614209054,174999,06/30/2019,4900,CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE,182999,1566259,004534830,Xinyu  Zhao,191 Auditorium Road UNIT 3139,Storrs,US,Storrs Mansfield,CT02,University of Connecticut,CT,062693139,xinyu.zhao@uconn.edu,Xinyu,Zhao,,8604863622,sprasad@nsf.gov,Sushil Prasad,7032925059,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,,07/01/2016,CRII: ACI: Efficient Radiative Heat Transfer Modeling In Large-Scale Combustion Systems,Grant

256,"Cryptography is one of the most important tools in securing data, communication, and cyberinfrastructure. Driven by ever-increasing amounts of data and the associated computational demands, organizations and individuals are outsourcing storage and computation to ""the cloud."" As our e-mail, medical, financial, and other personal information increasingly reside in systems outside of our direct control and are of increasing value to attackers, the need to simultaneously guarantee privacy, availability of data, and correctness of computations is paramount. This digital reality poses complex challenges to cryptography and requires a paradigm shift in our goals and mode of thinking.  This research coordination network, led by DIMACS and the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, will bring together cryptographers and others to depart from the traditional goals of cryptography, namely a relatively narrow focus on secure and authenticated communication, and significantly advance the state of the art toward systems that are simultaneously highly efficient, highly secure, and highly functional.  

Specific goals for this RCN project include bringing researchers together to facilitate and catalyze our understanding of: what primitives and performance can be obtained from specific intractability assumptions; fundamental tradeoffs and impossibility results; and how best to drive adoption by system designers and implementers of more secure technologies and practices. The project will start with an intensive Summer 2015 program at the Simons Institute to launch the collaboration and build momentum, followed by a two-year ""special focus"" led by DIMACS that will sustain the project through Summer 2017 and expand it to include more people and more topics.  The project will enable both foundational advances in cryptography and practical advances in its usability, providing improved security, flexibility, and efficiency. These advances have the ability to positively impact society by improving: the robustness of our national cyber infrastructure and cyber-connected physical infrastructure; the security of commercial applications in banking, health care, manufacturing, media, and more; and the extent to which individuals can have control over and confidence in protection of their personal data.

This was the 727th event of the European Federation of Chemical Engineering (EFCE).

The conference aimed to highlight the contributions of the PSE/CAPE community to the sustainability of the modern society. Through contributions from academia and industry, the goal was to establish the core products of PSE/CAPE, define the new and changing scope of our results, and the future challenges we face. The conference also served to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the ESCAPE series, the 12th PSE conference and the 40th year of the Computers and Chemical Engineering journal. The organizers aimed to make PSE2015/ESCAPE25 more open yet more competitive, giving a platform to anybody who has a good story, high scientific quality, interesting application and new significant development to tell. To achieve all this, a package of measures was developed: flexible registration fee; attractive scientific program; world-wide participation; high industrial participation; and incentives for young researchers, to mention a few. The goal was to create an academic and industrial dialogue, a critical assessment of existing enabling technologies, a discussion on research, education, and industrial needs, and a forum for new directions, challenges and opportunities in process systems engineering.

The PSE (Process Systems Engineering) series of conferences are held once every three years. The previous conference (PSE-2012) was held in Singapore in July 2012. The last time it was held in Europe was in 2006, jointly with ESCAPE-16 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.

The ESCAPE conference series (European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering) is held every year. It is organized by a host member society of the EFCE on behalf of the Working Party on Computer Aided Process Engineering (CAPE-WP). The series started with ESCAPE-1 held in Denmark in 1992. The previous meeting in the series, ESCAPE-24 was held in Budapest in June 2014.

PSE2015/ESCAPE25 brought together and fostered interaction among world-renowned experts from academia and industry, researchers and practitioners from government laboratories and several industries, graduate students, and post-docs.

The primary objectives of the PSE2015/ESCAPE25 conference were tri-fold: providing an in-depth review and critical assessment of the current state of the art; discussing the current and future needs of research, education and training; and identifying new directions, opportunities, and challenges in sustainable chemical product and process systems engineering. The conference created a technical and scientific forum for the topics of new developments in the application of computing and systems technology to chemical and biochemical engineering problems.

A total of 600 delegates (54% academia, 11% industry, 35% students) from 50 countries traveled to Copenhagen, Denmark to participate in PSE2015/ESCAPE25 and included 35 representatives from industry and government as well as 52 students. This NSF grant provided travel support for all US participants (27 in total) that qualified as junior researchers, i.e. students, postdocs, and junior faculty.

The technical program consisted of plenary lectures, invited keynote lectures, contributed oral presentations and contributed poster presentations focusing on new developments in the application of computing and systems technology to chemical and biochemical engineering problems through the following topical areas:

The project will develop a socio-technical model of ""organic team science"" in which scientists are motivated to collaborate across diverse scientific communities and to share and normalize data to solve scientific problems through an open framework. potentially creating new cross-disciplinary collaborations around the modelling problems. The project will advance hydrology by making already-collected geospatial data more usable for analysis and simulations. It will advance limnology by developing an integrated hydrodynamic model of lakes as connected to the broader hydrologic network to quantify water, material, nutrient and energy fluxes, which is potentially transformative for limnology. The project will be carried out with collaborators including the NSF Susquehanna/Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory and the GLEON projects.

The project will provide benefits by developing cyberinfrastructure to provide access for limnology to climate and geospatial data and models as well as novel practices for supporting organic team science. The later is potentially a significant and transformative contribution to the infrastructure for science. The hydro-dynamic model could be useful for those managing lakes. The proposal includes plans for outreach to the scientific community to share these findings.",NSF,4900,"PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY, THE",110 Technology Center Building,UNIVERSITY PARK,US,University Park,PA05,Pennsylvania State Univ University Park,PA,168027000,47.070,"['Yolanda  Gil', 'Paul C Hanson']",09/12/2013,003403953,1000000,03/31/2018,4900,Cyber-Human Systems (CHS),1000000,1344272,003403953,Christopher J Duffy,212 Sackett Building,University Park,US,University Park,PA05,The Pennsylvania State University,PA,168021408,cxd11@psu.edu,Christopher,Duffy,J,8148634384,wbainbri@nsf.gov,William Bainbridge,7032928930,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Diverse research communities from around the globe who study lake-catchment systems require a new way of carrying out their research, sharing their data, contributing to new theories and publishing their work. This research has also improved the capacity for: 1) starting communities who have common research interests, 2) inclusion of newcomers, 3) retaining members, 4) fostering contributions, 5) encouraging commitment, and 6) regulating behavior. These principles have guided the design of our organic data science framework and in the evolution of model and data services in support of hypothesis-driven research (http://www.organicdatascience.org). 

From the physical science perspective, the research focused on theoretical and experimental aspects of the ""age"" of water and carbon in lake-catchment systems. In this context, ""age"" is defined as the time since the water parcel and environmental tracer entered the system as precipitation. We note that each of our communities have developed an observing system for isotope ratios of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and other environmental tracers but with very different science questions. In this research we have developed a framework using models and data for defining a unified ""landscape"" for the catchment-lake system, forming a richer and more collaborative shared research strategy including development of open national data services (http://www.hydroterre.psu.edu/HydroTerre/Help/Ethos.aspx). 

Our hypothesis is that the lake-catchment provides an experimental basis for predicting flow paths, residence times and the relative age of water and dissolved solutes in space and time, and that understanding these spatiotemporal patterns will provide a deeper understanding of fundamental biogeochemical processes including carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen cycling within the lake-catchment system (see https://doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10070).

259,"This project attacks the pressing research problem of scaling and semi-automating large network experiments.  Networking research is technically challenging due to the great scale and heterogeneity of protocols and devices in the Internet that researchers need to experiment with. To address this the project will investigate and tackle the problems of resource limitations and experimental artifacts of the testing platforms and scaling techniques. Work to date has either focused on control plane protocols (e.g., routing simulators), or solely considered the data plane. This project's goal is to conduct experiments that are joint control plane and data plane at a scale not previously possible.  

The project project includes three complementary efforts to address experimentation scale challenges by designing:

(1) Experiment Mapping Tools and Taxonomy: The project will design a general framework, taxonomy, and a set of tools to bridge the current gap between testbed users and large-scale testbed experiments that use multiple scaling techniques. The user can supply hints on desired fidelity of different components, and these will be used to determine a high fidelity mapping for the experiment.
(2) Experiment Analysis and Partitioning Tools: The project will design methods to model complex dependencies between components of a large-scale experiment to facilitate planning and mapping. These models may also allow partitioning the large experiment into maximally independent smaller experiments that can be sequentially executed to mimic the large experiment.
(3) Applications to Case Studies: The project will use a range of large experiments as applications, focusing on problematic experiments including (a) experiments to understand the effect of misconfigurations, attacks, and defenses on Internet infrastructure (e.g., scalability of RPKI, effect of worms or DDoS on BGP, BGP policy conflicts), (b) experiments for anomaly detection, and (c) experiments with cloud computing.

The research will help identify and deploy scalable protocols that will enable the Internet to securely accommodate increased traffic volumes. Impacts of the research include the development and public dissemination of general-purpose experimental tools, large-scale testing techniques, methodologies for the use of testing frameworks, and related graduate-level courseware. The PI will undertake significant outreach efforts to simulation and testbed teams, e.g., DETER/Emulab, GENI, AutoNetkit, ns-3, and to industry. The PI will actively involve undergraduate and graduate students from under-represented minority groups in computer science in the research and educational efforts, and will organize a DIMACS workshop on project topics.",NSF,4900,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,Young Hall,West Lafayette,US,West Lafayette,IN04,Purdue University,IN,479072114,47.070,,08/20/2013,072051394,325785,08/31/2017,4900,RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS,325785,1319924,072051394,Sonia  Fahmy,305 N.

The research has increased our fundamental understanding of today's experimentation systems, tools, and scaling techniques, and the classes of experiments that are appropriate on each system. The tools developed in this project have enabled complex computer network experiments at a scale not previously possible by designing:

(1) Experiment Mapping Tools and Taxonomy: This includes a general framework called EasyScale, a mapping algorithm called the Waterfall algorithm, and a set of tools to bridge the current gap between testbed users and large-scale testbed experiments that use multiple scaling techniques. The user can supply hints on desired fidelity of different components, and these are used to determine a high fidelity mapping for the experiment. Multiple scaling techniques, such as virtualization and real-time simulators, can be used for different parts of the input experimental topology in order to balance scalability and fidelity. 

(2) Experiment Analysis and Partitioning Tools: This includes methods to model dependencies between components of a large-scale experiment to facilitate planning and mapping.  An example model and partitioning method is based on traffic flows in an experiment. This is called Flow-based Scenario Partitioning (FSP). FSP allows partitioning a large experiment into maximally independent smaller experiments that can be sequentially executed on a small testbed to mimic the large experiment.

(3) Applications to Case Studies:  The techniques developed in this project have been evaluated on a range of large network experiments as applications, including security experiments with distributed denial of service attacks, Internet routing experiments, and experiments with data centers.

Additionally, this project has produced new programming assignments for undergraduate and graduate courses on computer networks. These programming assignments were shared with a number of faculty members at several academic institutions.

The project has made contributions to the development and realistic testing of new network architectures that make the Internet robust to cyber attacks and increase Internet performance. The work not only contributed to the tools available for researchers to test their Internet architectures, but also developed guidance and benchmarks for testing these mechanisms in realistic environments in a reproducible and scalable manner. These are likely to make cyber-infrastructure more trustworthy and resilient, and enable novel applications.

The publications and some of the software developed in this project have been disseminated to interested researchers, educators, and the industry, and on the project web page. The results have also been presented at major computer networking conferences and workshops.

The project has provided training for several graduate students, and has involved several additional undergraduate and graduate students. These students now have a better grasp of the fields of computer networking and software testing. They have gained an appreciation of the difficulty of testing new computer network designs and mechanisms in a realistic environment. They have also learned about the emerging technologies of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) which we have used as case studies.

260,"Past fossil fuel use has conferred a complex mixture of benefits and risks on current and future generations. While enabling a tremendous growth in prosperity, the resulting greenhouse gas emissions may contribute to irreversible changes.  For example, the Greenland Ice Sheet might disintegrate in response to anthropogenic climate forcings.  The resulting sea-level rise would create serious risks for the sustainability of low-lying regions in the United States and beyond. Managing climate risks has already motivated local, national, and global actions: utilities replace coal-fired power plants with gas turbines, engineers design sea-walls for future climates, companies sequester carbon dioxide into geological reservoirs, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office has assessed possible geoengineering approaches.  These actions raise the question: what are sustainable, scientifically sound, technologically feasible, economically efficient, and ethically defensible climate-risk management strategies?  Answering this question is nontrivial for several reasons.  First, it transcends the traditional boundaries between academic disciplines as well as between academia, industry, government, and nongovernmental organizations.  Second, choosing a strategy involves complex trade-offs across a large range of temporal and spatial scales.  Third, this is a problem imbued with deep uncertainty where decisionmakers disagree about the appropriate problem framing, model structure, parameter values, and objectives.  Characterizing and representing this deep uncertainty is critical.  For example, analyses under different ethical frameworks can suggest strongly divergent strategies.  Current analyses of climate-risk management strategies have typically used integrated assessment models that link knowledge and tools from fields such as Earth system science, engineering, economics, decision analysis, operations research, and statistics.  These integrated assessments have broken important new ground, but they face severe limitations with respect to four interrelated research questions: (i) How large are the uncertainties? (ii) What might be actionable early warning signals?  (iii) What are the trade-offs between the diverse set of current and potential future objectives? (iv) What are the relevant value decisions and how do they affect the conclusions?  Analyzing these questions requires fundamental advances in the relevant disciplines, an effective, large-scale, and sustained network to link them together, a research-training program to educate the next generation of scientists and engineers, and an integration of stakeholders and decisionmakers within a process of shared discovery.  This research network on sustainable climate-risk management strategies will provide these advances and address these research questions.  

The research network will catalyze fundamental, mission-oriented, and transdisciplinary research to characterize the trade-offs associated with choosing among climate-risk management strategies and analyze how different sustainability criteria interact across a broad range of temporal and spatial scales.  More broadly, the network will (i) train the next generation of diverse scientists and engineers through an international and multi-institutional research, education and mentoring program, (ii) provide cyber-infrastructure to support transdisciplinary and computationally intensive research collaborations using high-performance computation, new models, and analysis tools that are accessible via a web interface, (iii) bring together experts across disciplines in workshops, (iv) integrate a diverse set of stakeholders and decisionmakers into the analyses, providing them with decision-relevant information, and (v) reach out to educators, decisionmakers, underrepresented groups, and the general public through cyber-infrastructure resources and interactive teaching materials.",NSF,4900,"PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY, THE",110 Technology Center Building,UNIVERSITY PARK,US,University Park,PA05,Pennsylvania State Univ University Park,PA,168027000,47.050,"['Alan  Robock', 'Robert J Lempert', 'Chris E Forest', 'Nancy  Tuana']",09/25/2012,003403953,11910966,09/30/2019,4900,Sustainability Resrch Networks,11910966,1240507,003403953,Klaus  Keller,436 Deike Building,University Park,US,University Park,PA05,The Pennsylvania State University,PA,168025000,klaus@psu.edu,Klaus,Keller,,8148656718,sruth@nsf.gov,Sarah L.

261,"This project will develop and evaluate a prototype system to provide on-line process monitoring and guidance to the performers of health care processes. An Institute of Medicine report has estimated that nearly 100,000 people per year die in US hospitals from preventable errors, and subsequent reports have suggested that many of these errors arise due to the complexity of hospital processes.  The project will demonstrate how contextual information (retrospective, current, and prospective) can be used to provide process performers with timely information that could reduce errors, provide expedited warnings of impending hazards, and improve outcomes. Techniques to accumulate and represent historical data will be developed and will feed into profile-based analysis techniques that will evaluate probabilities and support making fine-grained process distinctions. These capabilities will provide a strong technological foundation for evidence-based, continuous process improvement.

Project technologies will be evaluated first using synthetic event streams generated by process model driven simulations, then by human simulations with nursing students using patient mannequins, and finally with medical professionals in simulated clinical settings. Processes to be examined include blood transfusion, chemotherapy, medication administration, and patient identification verification. Early community success in applying medical checklists and recent experimental results with proactive process guidance in a hospital emergency department are positive indications that the approaches proposed here have an excellent chance of gaining acceptance and improving medical outcomes.  Moreover, the technologies developed here, although evaluated specifically for health care, will also apply to human-intensive systems increasingly employed in a wide range of domains in society. The validated medical processes and the proposed prototype will be an effective framework for educating medical professionals in current best practices. This project will also educate computer science and engineering students about the challenges posed by the medical domain, encouraging a new generation of specialists in this emerging interdisciplinary field.

Spengler,7032928930,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"It is now well-known that medical errors are one of the major causes of death in the US. Although checklists have been shown to reduce errors in several domains, there is resistance to adopting them in medical care, perhaps because they tend to be somewhat limited, focusing primarily on the major, normative steps. The goal of this project was to develop a tool-supported framework for dynamically creating situational-aware, adaptive checklists that are responsive to the current situations facing the patient and process performers. The major outcomes include:

Technology support for automatically monitoring process events and then using that information to determine the context of the current process while it is being performed. Deviations from the desired process can be detected and reported relatively quickly after a deviation occurs, and evaluated using derived event streams. 


Technology support for generating a Smart Checklist user interface that shows the current status of an executing process, including completed steps, steps currently being performed, and a brief view of impending steps. Patient vital signs and other relevant data can be incorporated into the user interface as well. The interface to medical devices was built upon the Massachusetts General Hospital Interoperability framework (MD PnP) that provides a consistent interface to a wide range of devices. (Figure 1 shows an example generated Smart Checklist) 


Detailed process models for an outpatient blood transfusion process, chemotherapy administration, and emergency room flow in addition to initial process models for verifying patient identifiers for medicine administration and for cardiac surgery. These models are represented in the Little-JIL process definition language that provides rich semantics for supporting nominal as well as non-nominal, or exceptional, situations, concurrency, and human flexibility. (Figure 2 shows an example of a Little-JIL process model.)


Technology support for evaluating the process models for vulnerabilities, especially when critical steps are performed incorrectly. Given a particular hazard, an event that should be avoided, our technology creates a fault tree model of how that hazard could arise based on the Little-JIL process model. The fault tree is then analyzed to compute minimal cuts sets, collections of incorrectly performed events that could cause the hazard to occur if all occurred on a single execution of the process. By examining these cut sets, domain experts can determine if the process is vulnerable to failures and propose process modifications that can then be modeled and also analyzed. (Figure 3 provides an example (and simplified) fault tree for the blood transfusion process where the hazard is that a patient receives the wrong blood type. Figure 4 shows the minimal cuts sets that might allow this hazard to occur.)


Technology support for simulating scenarios based on the process models, plus specifications of the resources and constraints on their utilization, and information about the distribution of the expected inputs and individual events in the model. Model checking technology is used to verify the consistency of the resource constraints. The effectiveness of this approach has been demonstrated using the Little-JIL process model for an emergency room. Although there are many systems that support simulation, the Little-JIL simulator is based upon a detailed Little-JIL model of the process; our studies have shown that it provides more accurate predictions and is easier to introduce and evaluate alternative process and resource models.  (Figure 5 shows output from a battery of simulations of an emergency department under two different patient scheduling priorities.)


Technology for automatically generating requirements for selected components of an overall complex system so that the overall system requirements are guaranteed to be maintained. Thus, for example, if a new medical device is being considered for a medical procedure, the requirements that that device should adhere to can be determined based on the process that will be using it; alternatively, the requirements for the process can be determined based on the specified behavior of a set of devices employed by a medical procedure. These requirements could then be subsequently monitored to detect and report violations if they occur. 


 

The technology mentioned above, plus technology developed on previous NSF grants to support process modeling and analysis, provide a framework for continuous process improvement. A detailed process model can be defined, carefully analyzed for potential sequence errors using model checking and then evaluated using fault tree analysis (FTA) and failure modes and effect analysis (FMEA) to discover vulnerabilities. Proposed process improvements to address discovered errors and vulnerabilities, detected by these techniques or during the execution of an actual process, can be easily evaluated to assure that the modified process definition addresses these problems and does not introduce new problems, before the modifications are actually incorporated into the real-world process.  (Figure 6 provides a high-level overview of the framework.)

The overall goal of this joint project with UMass-Amherst was to develop a tool-supported framework for dynamically creating situational-aware, adaptive checklists that are responsive to the current situations facing the patient and caregivers.

 Serious medical errors can occur when hospital patients receive pain medication using Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) systems. These systems deliver a prescribed dose of medication on demand, usually when the patient presses a button. Patients using PCA sometimes receive an incorrect dose despite safeguards built into the system. Our work under this grant focused on understanding how PCA systems are used and the causes of these incorrect doses. Through this work, we hope to improve patient safety and contribute to better infusion systems generally.

 

We started by creating a clinical workflow of a typical PCA protocol. Usually protocols document the way that a process should be done, but often do not include everything that could happen to interrupt the process because there are too many possibilities that could cause a process change. We worked with the team at UMass-Amherst to create a mathematical model of the PCA workflow in the Little-JIL modeling tool, and to add many possible causes of interruption or change to the workflow as exceptions in this model.

 The major outcomes include:

 

With input from clinicians, we documented the detailed clinical workflow for infusion management (Patient Controlled Analgesia, or PCA), and worked with UMass to develop requirements for the prototype Smart Checklist app based on this use case. We added requirements in the areas of risk mitigation and interface requirements. UMass was able to create additional checklists for different scenarios based on this work.


 

For the UMass Smart Checklist user interface, we provided an interface to medical devices built upon the MD PnP OpenICE platform, which provides a consistent interface to a wide range of devices, to provide patient vital signs and other relevant data. (For more information about OpenICE, the open-source Integrated Clinical Environment project, see http://mdpnp.mgh.harvard.edu/projects/openice/) We assisted UMass in the use of OpenICE to provide data similar to what would been acquired in a PCA management scenario. The outcome of this was to enable realistic scenarios for testing the Smart Checklist tool, as well as to enhance the OpenICE software platform for use by the broader research community.


 

We analyzed how the Little-JIL dynamic process definition language would integrate into an Integrated Clinical Environment (ICE) and how it would be utilized in real-world applications, and worked with UMass to incorporate Little-JIL into their process models. 


 

We used what we learned from the modeling work to improve the model for PCA as well as improving our capability to model in general. To share the lessons learned with the biomedical and computer science communities, we wrote a paper about the modeling experience that was published as ""Capturing Essential Information to Achieve Safe Interoperability"" in Anesthesia and Analgesia. (124(1):1 July 2016).


This work has informed medical device, health information technology and middleware standards development, which we expect will influence future applications, design, and integration of medical devices.

263,"Following the scaling of CMOS transistors, electromechanical systems are undergoing a rapid and remarkable miniaturization into the sub-micron regime. Resonant nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) are eliciting particular interest because they allow access to microwave frequencies and nanosecond response times, amongst other pertinent metrics. These unprecedented properties are fueling the potentially ground-breaking application of NEMS in signal processing, electrometry, and chemical and biological sensing.  Despite their significant potential in these applications, the widespread implementation of resonant NEMS is currently impeded by: (i) a limited, system-level understanding of their complex dynamic behaviors, (ii) device-to-device performance irregularity, and (iii) a general incompatibility with existing CMOS fabrication technologies. This effort seeks to address these deficiencies through the modeling, design, fabrication, and characterization of highly-tunable, top-down fabricated, resonant nanosystems, which can be integrated with existing CMOS technologies. Specifically, the work seeks to develop fully-integrated, electrostatically-actuated devices, which can be repeatedly reproduced using commercial semiconductor process flows.  To this end, single- and dual-gate nanoresonators will be designed and fabricated using a silicon-on-insulator process and subsequently integrated with CMOS circuits capable of providing on-chip actuation, signal conditioning, response characterization, and device tuning.  Two nanoscale hardware platforms, a channel-select RF receiver and a gas-phase chemical sensor, which advantageously leverage the systems' inherently nonlinear behaviors, will then be developed to evaluate the merits of the proposed system-level modeling, analysis, design, and development approach.  

Overall, this effort should not only provide insight into the complex dynamical behaviors associated with a fully-integrated nanoresonator system, including attendant electronics, operating in a noisy, multi-physics environment, but also push forward the status of current nanofabrication technology. In addition, the effort should have broader impact through hierarchical integration with new educational efforts founded upon the existing cyber-infrastructure of the NSF Network for Computational Nanotechnology's nanoHUB and Purdue's Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program.  Specifically, the effort's PIs will (i) develop and deploy  a comprehensive software tool for the simulation of integrated SOI-CMOS resonant nanosystems; and (ii) develop and distribute new course materials and streaming video lectures associated with integrated nanosystems, which will be included in the PI's course on the Mechanics of Micro- and Nanosystems. The PIs anticipate that hundreds of students and scientists worldwide will utilize these resources to further their system-level understanding of nanoresonators.  It is important to note that the educational effort will also incorporate three undergraduate research experiences arranged through the SURF program.  These summer-long, intensive experiences will specifically target under-represented students.",NSF,4900,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,Young Hall,West Lafayette,US,West Lafayette,IN04,Purdue University,IN,479072114,47.041,['Saeed  Mohammadi'],08/20/2012,072051394,360053,08/31/2016,4900,DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS,360053,1233780,072051394,Jeffrey F Rhoads,155 South Grant Street,Wet Lafayette,US,West Lafayette,IN04,Purdue University,IN,479072114,jfrhoads@purdue.edu,Jeffrey,Rhoads,F,7654945630,akelkar@nsf.gov,Atul G.

264,"The University of California-Davis is awarded a grant to acquire a self-contained mobile laboratory for deployment at Quail Ridge Reserve, a 2000-acre unit of the University of California-Davis Natural Reserve System located in Napa County, California. The laboratory will be a three-room, general purpose facility. The large central room will house work-height countertops, desk space, a fume hood, sink and storage; two peripheral rooms will be available for use in animal holding and for behavioral trials. Lighting and climate control will be programmable; environmental conditions will be monitored by an automatic system linked to the reserve?s wireless communication network, alerting reserve staff immediately of any technical problems. The lab will be appropriate for processing, anesthetizing, tagging, holding, and conducting behavioral experiments on captured animals. A separate mobile generator unit will provide power to the laboratory, while minimizing noise inside the laboratory that could stress animals and disrupt natural behaviors. Water and waste water storage will be integrated into the unit.

Quail Ridge Reserve hosts multiple active research initiatives in animal genetics and behavior, as well as in plant physiology, that will directly and immediately benefit from the facility. Other NSF-sponsored initiatives, like the Quail Ridge automated animal tracking system (for which hardware is completed and software is in refinement), will rely heavily on the laboratory as a site for tagging or harnessing animals, or for performing surgical implants of transmitters for use with the system. This unique automatic system is poised to transform understanding of small animal movements, dispersal, and response to stressors by remotely tracking their locations and physiological conditions.

The new facility will promote novel uses of the existing cyber-infrastructure linking research enabled by the lab to remote portals, such as classroom and private computers via an ongoing 'virtual museum of the environment' initiative. Citizen scientists and after-school programs will be able to watch behavioral trials and eventually track the movement of animals from their computers in near real time. The lab will also be used by instructors from institutions of higher education that currently use the reserve and are largely minority-serving. On-going collaborations with international investigators and interns will benefit as well. Results from combined use of the lab facility and the animal tracking system will enhance understanding of animal movement and habitat use, thus informing habitat protection and conservation decisions.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS",OR/Sponsored Programs,Davis,US,Davis,CA03,University of California-Davis,CA,956186134,47.074,"['Jeffrey  Clary', 'Shane  Waddell']",06/27/2012,047120084,165301,06/30/2014,4900,FIELD STATIONS,165301,1227036,071549000,Virginia  Boucher,One Shields Ave,Davis,US,Davis,CA03,University of California-Davis,CA,956168803,vlboucher@ucdavis.edu,Virginia,Boucher,,5307526949,pmccartn@nsf.gov,Peter H. McCartney,7032928470,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The Quail Ridge Reserve mobile laboratory is a novel solution for researchers working at remote field sites.  It proves a hygienic, climate-controlled research space at the heart of a natural reserve &ndash; almost a mile from other existing facilities. The lab is equipped with work-height countertops, desk space, a fume hood and sink, programmable lighting and climate control that can be controlled remotely. As a fully approved animal care facility, the trailer has dedicated rooms for behavioral and feeding trials and for the brief holding of animals. Alerts are automatically sent via a wireless communication network if problems occur with the heating or lighting systems. A mobile generator unit provides power for the laboratory.

The reserve hosts many active research initiatives that will benefit from the trailer, including studies of animal genetics and behavior, as well as plant physiology. In particular, the trailer provides essential facilities to complement use of the NSF-funded Quail Ridge Automated Animal Tracking system.  The space can be used as a safe, clean area where wild animals can be tagged with transmitters that communicate with the system. Processing of plant samples is also done in the workspace.

Undergraduates, graduate students, and post-docs have participated in the deployment of the facility and in developing novel uses of the space. Early career scientists have helped shape and fund the animal tracking system both for individual research goals and for enabling the transfer of the technologies to other settings and researchers.

The new facility also promotes novel uses of the existing reserve cyber-infrastructure, linking research enabled by the lab to remote portals, such as classroom and private computers via an ongoing ""virtual museum of the environment"" initiative. Citizen scientists and after-school programs will soon be able to watch behavioral trials and eventually to track the movement of animals from their computers in near real time.

The strengthened research, education and outreach potential of the Quail Ridge Reserve contributes to conservation efforts. Habitat protection decisions are frequently based on very incomplete understandings of animal movement and habitat use. This new laboratory, in combination with the other resources at Quail Ridge, will advance our understanding of some of the most important ecosystem components in natural systems. In addition to allowing monitoring of small animals under ""normal"" conditions, researchers will also be able to observe animal responses to events such as onset of rains, fire, predators, and human noise and disturbance.

265,"To integrate genetics and climate change research, the Southwest Experimental Garden Array (SEGA), combines reciprocal transplant and provenance trial experimental designs with state-of-the-art multi-factor climate change manipulations. This facility will allow research that scales from genes to ecosystems to test the genetic basis of plant performance along environmental gradients. This facility allows users to test the fundamental hypothesis that a genetic by environment approach is central to understanding climate change impacts on the biomes of the world, and feedbacks of these biomes to the climate system. Such studies will become essential if managed translocation strategies are adopted. The potential of this powerful experimental approach, so successfully used in agriculture, has not been realized in climate change research. It requires an integration of genetics with community ecology, ecosystem science, climatology, and land management, disciplines that have traditionally lacked a genetics perspective. The promise of this approach is demonstrated by reciprocal transplant experiments showing that locally adapted tree species are now becoming locally ""maladapted"" due to strong genetic interactions with the environment, which in turn affects hundreds of associated species. Using a series of 10 common gardens (5 in each of two soil types) along an elevation gradient from desert to mountain forest ecosystems, this facility provides the basis of a new generation of climate change research. For example, using reciprocal transplants of the same plant genotypes, researchers from multiple disciplines will quantify the ecological and evolutionary impacts of climate change on 1) foundation plant species that drive their respective ecosystems, 2) their associated arthropod, microbial, and understory communities that depend upon these plants for their survival, 3) native-exotic species interactions, and 4) the ecosystem processes that emerge from these interactions. This facility will enable identification of physiological mechanisms that underlie differential species and genotype performance under current and future climatic conditions. Plant performance results from the array will allow modelers to incorporate a genetic algorithm to calibrate models and to predict vegetation shifts and whole community responses to climate changes. Because the southwestern USA is experiencing some of the highest levels of climate-change impacts in North America, our garden array can serve a regional as well as a global role in addressing the gene by environment interactions that are likely to reshape biotic communities this century.

This garden array will provide genetics information for scientists to make better informed predictions of the impact of climate change on individual species, communities, and ecosystems, which in turn will inform land management and restoration projects. Our array will: 1) provide a scientific basis for the concept of managed translocation, 2) identify drought tolerant genotypes and source population(s) that perform best at a given location for current and expected future climatic conditions, and 3) help develop techniques for managing invasive species that have benefited from climate change. This facility will enhance existing and new education programs and efforts to recruit and retain students from underrepresented groups in STEM fields. Under-graduates and graduate students will use these sites for their own research. Our sites at The Arboretum at Flagstaff and Wupatki National Monument will provide public outreach to 100,000 plus annual visitors. Stakeholders include 11 Research and Education Centers at NAU, USFS, NPS, TNC, USGS, BLM, Babbitt Ranches, and international collaborators. SEGA will serve as a model for proposed arrays worldwide.",NSF,4900,NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY,"ARD Building #56, Suite 240",Flagstaff,US,Flagstaff,AZ01,Northern Arizona University,AZ,860110001,47.074,"['Paul G Flikkema', 'George W Koch', 'Amy V Whipple', 'Samuel A Cushman']",09/22/2011,806345542,2479082,09/30/2017,4900,MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION,2848876,1126840,806345542,Thomas G Whitham,,,US,Flagstaff,AZ01,Northern Arizona University,AZ,860110001,Thomas.Whitham@nau.edu,Thomas,Whitham,G,9285237215,rfleisch@nsf.gov,Robert Fleischmann,7032928470,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"How do you study the effects of predicted changes in climate on a realistic, large scale out in the real world where plants actually grow? The Southwest Experimental Garden Array (SEGA) has chosen a novel approach &ndash; using a 4000? elevation gradient as landscape-scale experimental ?test bed?.  

Sites at lower elevation on the SEGA gradient have warmer and drier growing conditions &ndash; a mimic for predicted climate change &ndash; that are being used to test the effects on plant characteristics and identify genotypes best suited to cope with predicted climate shifts. Following a long tradition of ""common garden"" experiments (where each garden provides a ?common? growing environment) the observed differences in growth, survival, and performance to be attributed to naturally-occurring genetic variation within plant populations. SEGA also offers the opportunity to inform studies of assisted migration &ndash; by intentionally moving plants between sites and beyond current ranges to assess suitability to adapt to future habitat conditions.

Each site in the SEGA network is large enough to provide experimental space for multiple researchers; routine procedures for site operation are being documented in step-by-step written protocols. Researchers are provided with detailed safety instructions for working at the sites too, which include procedures for unlikely events (e.g. rattlesnake bite, sudden thunderstorm or vehicle breakdown).

SEGA sites are fenced to exclude large herbivores from eating the experiments and have water for irrigation. However, the most important &ndash; and innovative - feature of SEGA is the cyber infrastructure. A large collection of data loggers (specially developed to run off low-input solar panels in remote locations) known as WiSARDs are installed at every site and connected to state-of-the-art weather stations, PHENOCAMs (cameras which monitor growth stage experimental plants and native vegetation) and soil temperature and moisture sensors.  WiSARDs use wireless technology to relay data in real time back to Northern Arizona University?s campus. There the data are quality controlled and made freely available to researchers and the public via a web portal: https://data.sega.nau.edu/segaWeb/index.jsp.

Species being studied include ponderosa pine, southwestern white pine, pinyon pine and species of cottonwood - key habitat components across southwestern ecosystems. In studies of rangeland species blue gramma and galleta grass, the origin of soil microbes (local or distant), is being manipulated to see how this influences the plants? ability to adapt warmer-drier or cooler-wetter conditions. Also researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology recently carried out a highly successful study of natural genetic variants of wild tobacco plants &ndash; a useful analog species for many important crop plants in the Nightshade family (e.g. tomatoes, eggplant, peppers). Researchers have also started to study the ability of lizards and bees to tolerate temperature variation across the SEGA garden sites.
The combination of SEGA assets is attracting researchers who are breaking new ground in multiple disciplines - chemical, and pollination ecology, plant physiology and genetics. But conservation, science education and outreach is also at the core of SEGA. Members of the public and local Flagstaff schools participate in volunteer group field work at the sites on land managed by the Grand Canyon Trust (GCT) every year. A SEGA garden has been established at the Navajo Technical University, a tribally controlled university on the Navajo Nation to allow students there to participate in the program. Public open days occur annually at venues like The Arboretum and on Babbitt Ranches. SEGA outreach to the science and land manager community occurs through presentations at the Ecological Society of America summer meeting, biennial conference on the Colorado Plateau and specialist conferences. SEGA representatives also attend twice yearly research meetings organized by GCT.

The Arboretum at Flagstaff, host to two SEGA gardens, also serves as the primary venue for public outreach and education. Since the founding of SEGA, The Arboretum has received multiple grants from federal and private sources to develop climate science curricula for middle school students, build exhibits providing information on ""What you can do"" to mitigate effects of a warming climate, and created the Climate Change Center. The Arboretum?s Climate Change Center is a series of outdoor, interactive kiosks that highlight the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics incorporated into SEGA infrastructure and research. The institutions using SEGA include the U.S. Geological Survey, University of California, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Max Planck Institute of Chemical Ecology. The outcome from SEGA research will enable land managers to better restore and maintain landscapes after disturbance events, like catastrophic wildfire, flooding, and erosion, and preserve biodiversity under changing climates.

266,"The National Postdoctoral Association (NPA) will organize and host a 1.5-day workshop at the National Science Foundation in Arlington, Va., to expand dialogue in the postdoctoral community towards: (1) learning more about the postdoctoral experience in fields of study where postdoctorate study is not very common and (2) providing professional development opportunities for the postdoctoral participants.

The NPA will invite postdoctoral scholars (postdocs) in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences, in computational science/cyber-infrastructure, and in other related fields of study to attend. Postdocs have not been a tradition in these sciences as in the life sciences, where completing a postdoc has become a requisite to career success. The NPA will also invite other relevant parties to participate, including representatives from appropriate professional societies. The NPA is called upon by Federal agencies and institutions across the country to provide a national voice for postdocs. It is crucial that the NPA learn more about the challenges faced by postdocs in fields of study where postdoctorate training is not common in order to better represent them and to make informed recommendations for best practices to improve retention of these postdocs in academic research. Some of the expected outcomes of this workshop are:

1. That a written report of the proceedings of the workshop will be widely disseminated to the postdoctoral community and other relevant parties through the NPA.

2. That the participants will build or strengthen their network of support.

3. That lessons learned from this workshop will have a broader impact and provide insights as well as concrete recommendations for supporting new scientists across all disciplines.

Intellectual Merit

There is little data/information available regarding the experiences of postdocs from these fields of study. Learning more about the social, behavioral, and economic sciences postdoctoral community is essential, as this population has been steadily increasing. Learning more about the postdocs in the computational sciences/cyber-infrastructure is also essential. The field of cyberinfrastructure is a relatively new cross-disciplinary field that provides sophisticated tools for all disciplines and so has the potential to involve postdocs from many and varied fields of study. Any information that can be gained from this workshop will be valuable.

The NPA leadership engages on a regular basis with the most recent scholarship on postdoctoral scholars' experiences. The NPA will be able to create an informed and understanding platform for the workshop.

Broader Impacts

The workshop will result in a written report of the proceedings that will be widely disseminated by the NPA, on its Web site, at its meetings, and through its contacts. The information gained from this workshop will have a broader impact and provide insights for the national postdoctoral community across all fields of research.",NSF,4900,NATIONAL POSTDOCTORAL ASSOC,"1200 New York Ave., NW",Washington,US,Washington,DC00,National Postdoctoral Association,DC,200053928,47.075,,09/11/2011,785309787,49958,08/31/2012,4900,Broadening Participation of Gr,49958,1150325,,Cathee L Johnson-Phillips,1200 New York Avenue NW,Washington,US,Washington,DC00,National Postdoctoral Association,DC,200053928,cjphillips@nationalpostdoc.org,Cathee,Johnson-Phillips,L,2023266427,fchowdhu@nsf.gov,Fahmida N. Chowdhury,7032924672,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The National Postdoctoral Association (NPA) serves new researchers within three to five years of receiving the doctorate degree, or ""postdocs.""  Certainly, these researchers are experts in their fields, but the NPA has found that there is little understanding of and experience with cross-disciplinary collaborative research and the issues surrounding that collaboration. Increasing such understanding and knowledge specifically addresses both the intellectual merit and broader impact criteria, including the advancement of knowledge and the potential to benefit society, by providing information that would help these researchers to explore new avenues of research, innovation, and discovery.

Accordingly, the NPA desired to expand dialogue in the postdoctoral community towards providing professional development opportunities in regard to cross-disciplinary research for the postdoc participants. As a secondary goal, the NPA also hoped to learn more about the postdoc experience in fields of study where postdoctorate study is not common.

The workshop ""Expanding Cross-Disciplinary Dialogue in the Postdoctoral Community"" was held April 23-24, 2012, at the NSF in Arlington, VA.  The fields of study represented, as reported by the 29 fellows in attendance, included: adult learning and leadership; biomedical informatics; clinical psychology; cognitive science; computer science; computer simulation; cyberinfrastructure (OCI); economics; molecular and structural biology; psychology; social, behavioral, and economic sciences (SBES); social psychology; sociology/anthropology/education; and sociology/human services.

The workshop provided significant opportunities for professional development in the area of cross-disciplinary collaborative research. In addition to the networking and interaction among the fellows, the sessions provided information on the ethical concerns of collaborative research; a philosophical approach to improving cross-disciplinary communication; and an opportunity to visit with the NSF program officers, as well as an introduction to four professional societies/associations.

The fellows had ample opportunity to network and learn more about each otherÆs postdoc experiences. Based on feedback, both verbal and through the evaluation survey, several connections were made. For example, more than 64% of the respondents strongly agreed or agreed that they had made connections that would help them move forward in their careers.

Through the small and large group discussions, the NPA learned much more about the postdoctoral experience in disciplines where the postdoc has not been an experience.  One issue expressed by these postdocs was the fear that engaging in collaborative research would hinder their careers: There are few journals that publish the results of multi-disciplinary research, and publications are crucial to acquiring many positions.

The majority of the respondents strongly agreed or agreed that the workshop was very useful, and nearly all of them strongly agreed or agreed with the statement ""I have a better understanding of the way in which research philosophies impact cross-disciplinary collaboration.""

Both HU and ECSU are Historically Black College and University (HBCU).
Intellectual Merits
Prompted by the recent rapid climate change, universities are in need of new and timely curricular materials to educate the future generations of scientists and engineers, who will then lead the society in tackling one of the gravest challenges in our life time.
The overall goals of EPiCCS were to 1) modernize undergraduate curricula by infusing climate change and sustainability science; 2) strengthen studentsÆ practical training in climate-related research and science communication; 3) improve technology and cyberinfrastructure at the two HBCUs to enrich experiential inquiry-based learning as well as cross-campus peer-learning; 4) increase recruitment of talented underrepresented students into higher degrees in climate change and sustainability related study. EPiCCS was a collaborative effort between two prominent HBCUs and a leading marine research institution in the mid-Atlantic region.

VIMSÆs portion of the project was led by Prof. Kam W. Tang. This report pertains to TangÆs specific responsibilities and outcomes in the project: 1) Participate in project meetings to review progress and plan activities. The project progressed as scheduled with minimal delay or changes; 2) Organize and lead ""communicating science workshop"". Increasingly more undergraduate students attend scientific conferences to present their research work but unfortunately they often lack proper training of presentation skills. This workshop addressed this issue by providing guidance on how to prepare and deliver oral and poster presentations in conference setting. Both HU and ECSU students attended, some of whom brought their draft presentations for critique and improvement. Based on an anonymous end-of-workshop questionnaire survey, participants gave the workshop an average score of 4.68 out of 5, indicating that the workshop was well received; 3) Develop and teach 50% of the new course module ""Global Climate Change"". A core component of EPiCCS was to develop a new course module on climate change, which was lacking in HU and ECSU. Tang developed and taught 50% of the module at HU; the lectures were simultaneously transmitted to ECSU using interactive distance learning technology; 4) To ensure continuation of the module ""Global Climate Change"" beyond the life time of the grant, Tang digitized his lecture materials, added detailed instructorÆs notes and supplementary readings, and shared them with HU and ECSU. The two universities now can easily share them with faculty members, and use them to develop other modules on climate change and sustainability.


Broader Impacts
Climate change problems extend beyond the academic world and concern every citizen. The solution to the problems via the practice of a sustainable life style requires the participation of all people. This project helped nurture a new generation of citizen that has become better informed and conscientious about climate change and sustainability. Investment in infrastructure and improvement of curricula also allow continuation of climate change and sustainability education in HU and ECSU, thereby ensuring the legacy of this NSF award.

268,"Understanding the processes determining abundance of terrestrial wildlife communities across large scales and estimating the abundance of wildlife across large areas remain a major challenge.  For most species, the factors that regulate their distribution and yearly fluctuations in population size are unknown.  This project takes advantage of the key innovation of using motion sensitive camera traps as a network of sensors for estimating animal abundance. This new approach can produce abundance data for any terrestrial animal >100g, typically ~60% of the terrestrial animals in the eastern USA. Furthermore, the method is amenable to citizen science programs, without the biases or data quality issues typical of other programs, opening the possibility of a sustainable dense sampling effort across large areas. Software will be developed efficiently enter and to manage camera images and associated data. Using standardize field techniques citizen?s groups will sample their local wildlife communities with cameras. The resulting data will be analyzed using new multi-scale statistical models to discover the processes regulating wildlife abundance over large areas. Mapping the local abundance of wildlife populations across broad areas will be key to understanding the mechanisms responsible for changes resulting from land-management decisions and regional climate variation. By involving citizens in data collection this project will be helping local wildlife populations.

Blood,7032928470,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"This NSF grant has allowed us to develop the software and database tools for our eMammal cyber-infrastructure to manage large scale citizen science based surveys of wildlife and use these data to test hypotheses about the determinants of abundance for mammals. eMammal is a biological informatics cyber-infrastructure which brings together citizen scientists and wildlife professionals to collect, analyze, and manage massive camera-trap data. These data allows us to discover the processes regulating wildlife abundance over large areas with sophisticated multi-scale statistical models.

 During the past three years, we have worked with over 300 citizen scientists to deploy camera traps at 2,357 locations in 30 study sites across 6 states generating ~100,000 detections of wildlife and 2.6 million animal image samples, representing more than 130 years of survey work. 

 We have developed algorithms to detect animal presence (or, classify camera trap images with and with animals), to segment the animal from the highly cluttered background, to place a bounding box around this animal, and to characterize the identity of this species. During tests on the public available benchmark test datasets, our detection and segmentation algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-arts vision algorithms in the literature. In the past year we have improved the performance of this algorithm so that it could be integrated into the software used by our volunteers. This integration was successful last year, such that the tool is now used by citizen scientists to help them find the animal in the image. These tools and data analysis protocols have been implemented over 2 years producing 52,863 detections of native wildlife in 42,874 camera nights of survey effort across 1953 locations camera sites in 32 parks. These data are now all cleanly annotated with environmental and human data, and combined in a database, which can be queried to enable multiple different statistical analyses.

 We have developed a quantitative modeling framework for the analysis of data returned from the camera trap systems. This framework considers the detection rate and occupancy evaluation for animals as a measure of relative abundance that can be compared across sites (e.g., hunted versus non-hunted, on trail versus off trail). These models can accommodate both categorical and continuous covariates, auto-correlated counts, and nuisance parameters such as imperfect detection rates and year effects. For instance, we will explicitly model week and year effects, to account for temporal variation in relative abundance, and spatial location, which incorporates spatial autocorrelation among camera traps into the models' covariance parameters.     

 We have integrated all tools into the Smithsonian cyberinfrastructure. The Smithsonian Data Repository has finished building the workflow that automatically downloads data approved by scientists via the eMammal Expert Review Tool and loads that data into the Smithsonian database. The Smithsonian team has also created an application programming interface (API) so that visitors to the eMammal website may search the data in the database and run pre-set analyses on camera trapping data.

 The success of eMammal as a macro-scale wildlife-monitoring tool hinges on our ability to recruit large numbers of volunteers to run cameras over large areas.  Our key innovation and contribution of eMammal has been to standardize field protocols, and create a fun and efficient way to classify, share, and store these amazing photographs and discoveries. We had great success in terms of volunteer recruitment and engagement, working with about 500 different volunteers across 6 states. We had high volunteer turnout with relatively little advertisement, 98% of our volunteers completed the program, and all returned the equipment.

Research Objectives and Approaches

The objective of this research is to contribute to the interdisciplinary topic on STEM and basic medical science, specifically Patient-Centered Health Informatics Applications, with the newly proposed techniques that stand to benefit from the investigator?s expertise in engineering and from the collaboration with medical experts.

The approach is to study the medical data from several institutions comprehensively with the dynamics of all the datasets in their entirety such as non-linearity with kernel factors, and the network characteristics of whole multiple database distribution, rather than applying traditional techniques of prediction and classification to the very limited number of small medical testbeds.

Intellectual Merit 

When the proposed adaptive tracking method is used on soft tissue tumors, radiosurgery systems maintain precise targeting of the tumor by predicting tumor motion using a motion tracking system.  The successful development of the proposed dynamic classification method will substantially advance the clinical implementation of cancer screening, promote the early diagnosis of colon cancer, lead to an improved screening rate, and ultimately contribute toward reducing the mortality due to colon cancer.

Broader impacts 

The proposed data-intensive solutions can save millions of cancer patients every year.  The expected outcomes will be applied to medical problems and benefit society as a whole by enhancing the quality of all our lives, through unprecedented advances in the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer.

These two disciplines possess different momentum and emphasis, which makes them attractive to periodically review trends and new developments in their overlapping spheres of influence. The PI merged them together for adaptive learning so that the desired goal can be achieved.

Broader Impacts: The data-intensive solutions have been applied to several medical problems such as Radiology and Radiation Oncology. We also developed feasible non-linear tracking/classification methods for genetic engineering testbeds of robotics, transportation (i.e. a smart vehicle), and human behavior analysis with sufficiently complex structures. The statistical innovations for the complex systems expanded the nation's cyber infrastructure and high performance computing capability. As a result of this award, the PI has achieved the following two accomplishments to disseminate his findings to benefit society:

[Medical Imaging]

Precise estimation of respiratory motion in Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is crucial for image-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy, gated therapy, and tumor tracking in thorax and upper abdomen regions. Existing techniques to track the breathing motion use either markers or a diaphragm location in the CBCT images as a surrogate. Implanting internal markers requires not only invasive procedure but additional tasks to acquire effective estimation results. When using the diaphragm location, there is a projection view restriction that the diaphragm region must be visible in every projection. To overcome these limitations, our goals are to track breathing motion without the surrogate and to build a patient-customized 4D respiratory motion model based on the CBCT projections. It is expected that this research project would achieve automatic respiration tracking and would enhance the accuracy of dose delivery.

[Data Analytics]

Recent applications require supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques that can tackle big dataset demands. Datasets expand both in number of collected instances and features. Our research encounters the challenges of implementing fast, smart and efficient techniques that can cope with such demands. The lab group started proposing artificial intelligent models using powerful computers to develop a new method dubbed as the Multi-Column RBF Network (MCRN). The MCRN improves the accuracy and speed of a traditional Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN). RBFN, as a fully connected artificial neural network (ANN), suffers from costly kernel inner-product calculations. This is due to the use of many instances as the hidden units? centers. MCRN was tested on many benchmark datasets and showed better accuracy and faster training and testing speed compared to a single RBFN, support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN). Research also includes developing an innovated sparse coding and dictionary learning techniques. Those techniques are proposed to speed up the sparse feature extraction from big images.

Zanzerkia,7032928556,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The Quake-Catcher Network (QCN) project is a collaborative initiative to develop a large, low-cost, strong-motion seismic network. This network is made up of small (about the size of a matchbook) sensors that attach via a USB connection to internet-connected computers.  In February of 2010 within ~10 days of the Chile magnitude 8.8 earthquake approximately 100 QCN sensors were deployed in the mainshock region.  After the New Zealand magnitude 6.3 earthquake in 22 February 2011, approximately 100 QCN sensors were deployed within a week of the mainshock.  Currently, there are over 2,000 QCN seismic sensors installed globally in homes, schools and offices. Anyone can purchase a sensor for ~$50 and sensors deployed in schools cost only $5 (http://qcn.stanford.edu).

 

As part of this collaborative effort, the Scripps Team repurposed the IRIS ground motion visualization (GMV) data product computer codes to create temporal evolution visualizations of QCN data.  These automated codes produce movies that have multiple components including a map of the mainshock location, locations of deployed QCN sensors color-coded to indicate vertical motion (downward==blue, upward==red), and shading to depict land and sea regions. These visualizations also include the trajectory of the seismic waves (i.e., great circle path) and a representative seismogram with a time-indicator of the data's temporal behavior.  The software is configurable and allows the user to request or deny different features. We pre-process the QCN data, applying a quality control algorithm.  This was essential because one bad data trace could overwhelm the visualization.  To accomplish this we used a standard automated long-term-average (LTA) to short-term-average (STA) ratio method, which eliminated bad traces from consideration.

 

The Scripps Team also developed and distributed an educational videogame (http://siogames.ucsd.edu) that allows players to learn about the QCN network logistics and its unexpected challenges. Our goal in designing this educational videogame was to get the player to look at failure as a challenge, not a stigma, and to provoke their curiosity in exploring scientific unknowns.  The player plays the role of a scientist, making decisions about seismic station deployment strategies similar to decisions made by today's seismologist.  The game also allows the player to participate in the immediacy of deploying QCN seismic sensors as quickly as possible to record aftershocks.  We specifically target 8-12 year olds because research indicates early exposure to science is an effective way to refute protests of ""math is boring"" and ""science is hard"". The game uses the Microsoft Kinect controller-free environment that makes the game accessible to players of all ages and is user-friendly to those who don't have videogame experience.  Key elements of the game include selecting sensor locations in a large-scale virtual city, adequately installing the sensor and practicing seismic safety techniques. ?During game play aftershocks can occur unexpectedly, as can other problems that require attention (e.g., power-outages, equipment failure and theft). ?The player accrues points for quickly deploying the first sensor (i.e., recording as many initial aftershocks as possible), correctly installing the sensors, distributing the sensors adequately in the region, and troubleshooting problems. One can also net points for efficient use of gameplay time.

 

The Scripps Team also deployed ~45 QCN sensors in the following regions.

We explored the use of data from the accelerometers in computers, from USB accelerometers connected to computers, and accelerometers in smartphones. We found that smartphone accelerometers are sensitive enough to record earthquake of magnitude 5 or larger within ~10 km of the phone.  We also found that we can use on-phone processing to distinguish between earthquake shaking and every-day motions of the phone with a 99.7% sucess rate.  We have now developed an app that is suitale to be rolled out to a few thousand users to trigger on eearthquake shaking and send the data collected back to a central surver.  We plan to test this over the coming months.  As such we fin this to be a very promising result and we plan to continue to explore the use of smarthphones in the future.  This resarch has shown that it may be possible to harness the data from millions of phones in the future.

Zanzerkia,7032928556,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Through this award, we dramatically expanded the number and distribution of low-cost seismic sensors installed in homes, schools, and businesses. These sensors form the Quake Catcher Network (QCN), which takes a novel approach to increasing the density of seismic stations for improved understanding of earthquake processes and related seismic risks to the public. Several thousand sensors were distributed to members of the public in regions of the United States at high seismic hazard, and to schools, museums and other public learning centers throughout the country

 

 

During the project period, we completed testing of the sensors to determine the nominal sensor response. These sensor tests are critical for both evaluating sensor quality and for use of the data in analysis of recorded ground motions. The sensors used by QCN performed as expected, producing accurate estimation of ground accelerations, albeit at low resolution than traditional, higher cost sensors.

 

Using data collected during the project period we also pursued and accomplished several scientific studies. We were able to show that it was possible to use the low cost sensors and distributed computing techniques employed by QCN to rapidly detection earthquakes. The initial detection algorithms were developed and testing using data from an aftershock deployment following the Feb. 2010 M8.8 Maule, Chile earthquake. These algorithms were then implemented in real time during another aftershock deployment following the Sept 2010 Darfield earthquake. The results of the real time test show very rapid (8-10 sec on average) detection times and accurate magnitudes (within 1 magnitude unit) and locations (within 10 km, on average). These suggest that the low cost sensors may provide valuable real time data that could be used in earthquake early warning systems. 

 

We also completed an in-depth comparison of ground motions recorded by QCN and traditional sensors the Darfield, New Zealand earthquake sequence. Some of the QCN stations were installed close to existing network stations to examine how ground motion records compared in an æreal-worldÆ deployment. We found that peak ground accelerations recorded by the QCN sensor had similar values to and similar scatter as the traditional stations. In addition, we found that when data were integrated to velocity and displacement there was little different in the time series. These results show that the QCN sensors can provide high-enough quality data for a variety of scientific studies.

 

In addition, using the data recorded by the dense arrays installed in Chile and New Zealand we were able to estimate local site response at the station locations. Site response examines the variability in ground motions due to local geologic structure. Generally, it is difficult to get dense observations of ground motion across a particular region because seismic instrumentation is too costly and difficult to deploy. However, we installed 100 and 180 stations in Chile and New Zealand, respectively that recorded hundreds aftershocks. These data were used to examine local variation in ground motion, and in the case of New Zealand also showed evidence for liquefaction at a number of sites.

 

Finally, we began investigating whether QCN sensors were adequate to recover building response. The response of a building dictates how a building will react to ground shaking. It is possible to estimate building response using ambient noise (wind, cultural noise) and/or small events, which can then be used to predict how a building might be have in a larger, potentially damaging event. We instrumented several buildings in Los Angeles, including the Factor Building on the UCLA campus. The Factor building response has been studied in depth using traditional instrumentation. We compared the building response recovered by QCN sensor to that previously reported and found that, while the data were noisier, we were still able to estimate the fundamental modes...",,"['Chung, A.

274,"The Targeted Math-Science Partnership of Science Learning through Engineering Design (SLED) vision is to increase grade 3-6 student learning of science by developing Indiana's first integrated, engineering design-based approach to elementary/intermediate school science education. The partnership involves Purdue University's colleges of Engineering, Science, Technology, and Education working with four Indiana school districts: Taylor Community School Corporation, Plymouth School Corporation, Lafayette School Corporation, and Tippecanoe School Corporation. The project is devising a design- and standards-based curriculum, inventing design-informed science instructional methods, and implementing on-going assessments to inform the project at the pre- and in-service teacher education levels in central Indiana. The partnership is using summer institutes, linkages with Purdue pre-service teachers, cyber-infrastructure, action research, and graduate coursework to equip teachers with design-based pedagogical skills and science content. An external advisory board consisting of recognized experts in science education, mathematics education, and engineering design meet annually to provide input to the project team.

The project has four interrelated components: 

1) collaboration between STEM disciplinary faculty and grades 3-6 teachers to adapt and develop engineering design-based tasks; 
2) an in-service teacher professional development program to equip grades 3-6 teachers in partnering schools to use engineering design as a tool for teaching science through authentic, inquiry-based, multi-disciplinary design units; 
3) a pre-service teacher education program to prepare future elementary school teachers to teach science using the engineering design process; and 
4) research that will investigate how grades 3-6 teachers teach science through the engineering design process and how students learn through design-based activities.

Specific outcomes that the partnership is working to produce include:

1) In-service professional development for 200 elementary/intermediate school teachers and preparation of 100 pre-service teachers in the use of engineering design to teach science through authentic, inquiry-based, multi-disciplinary design projects.
2) Improved science achievement of 5,000 students in grades 3-6 in the partner schools through exposure to engineering design-based curriculum and activities implemented by teachers. 
3) A library of tested, design-based curricular materials to support teaching science in grades 3-6.

This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).

Funds are provided to improve the current research laboratory conditions in Cannon Hall at Wesley College. Wesley College is a leading private liberal-arts institution with 1600 full-time traditional age undergraduates and a total enrollment of 2200. The Departments of Science and Mathematics are housed in Cannon Hall, where the 1960s vintage science laboratories and facilities are substandard. The building was designed at a time when the primary mission of the college was teaching. Recently the science department has responded to Delaware's emphasis on productive competitive research partnerships with a significant growth in its mentored undergraduate research programs. The facility was not designed to handle the level or size of the research programs and does not meet contemporary research standards since research has become more complex and utilizes more sophisticated equipment than when the building was built. The proposed modernization of available research facilities, will address critical research laboratory deficiencies by renovating obsolete laboratory spaces (Cannon 215, Cannon 214, and Cannon 115) to contemporary laboratory building standards including adequate ventilation; demolition of existing mechanical/electrical/ gas/plumbing systems, workstations, and floor finishes; constructing new workstations, flammable storage cabinets, mechanical/electrical/gas/plumbing systems, floor and wall finishes; and the construction of a cold room for protein purification (FPLC). This will provide much needed space for the growing Wesley undergraduate mentored research participants. Furthermore, with the convergence of communication applications and operating systems from consolidating and upgrading the cyber infrastructure for Cannon Hall will meet the connectivity demands of the next-generation applications and devices. Alignment of research with state needs and a capability to leverage renovations into valuable research is a significant benefit from the renovations. The broadest impact of the proposed modernization will be an increased ability to seek out, attract, and prepare Wesley's very diverse research participants (70% women, 21% from underrepresented populations, and 29% first-generation college students).",NSF,4900,WESLEY COLLEGE INC,120 N State Street,Dover,US,Dover,DE00,Wesley College,DE,199013875,47.074,"['Keka C Biswas', 'Kathleen L Curran']",09/16/2010,067373803,281676,09/30/2012,4900,INSTRUMENTAT & INSTRUMENT DEVP,281676,0960503,067373803,Malcolm J D'Souza,120 N State Street,Dover,US,Dover,DE00,Wesley College,DE,199013875,dsouzama@wesley.edu,Malcolm,D'Souza,J,3027362528,eblood@nsf.gov,Elizabeth R. Blood,7032928470,040101 RRA RECOVERY ACT,"Overview: Wesley College (Wesley), a private baccalaureate minority-serving institution (MSI) in the liberal arts is located in the historic district of Dover Delaware. It is fully accredited through the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and, in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields; it offers Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees in biology, biological chemistry, environmental studies (ES), mathematics, and medical technology. ES offers a Master of Science (M.S.) degree program. There are 138 STEM undergraduates in Cannon Hall, a three-story science &amp; math building, named for alumna/scientist Annie Jump Cannon. Sixty percent of the Wesley-STEM students are female, and in fall 2011, the racial demographics of the STEM program were: 49% African-American, 31%Caucasian, 6% Hispanic, 1% Native American, 1% Asian, and 12% other (mixed heritage). More than 40% of the students are the first in their families to attend college. There are 14 full-time STEM faculty members.

The Wesley College science department has responded to DelawareÆs emphasis on productive competitive research partnerships with a significant growth in its mentored undergraduate STEM ""directed research"" programs. After the receipt of this NSF ARI R2 award (#960503), Wesley has reinvigorated some of its existing undergraduate research spaces to contemporary laboratory standards. This has provided much needed space for its growing number of undergraduate mentored research participants. Furthermore, we consolidated and upgraded the cyber infrastructure within Cannon Hall to meet the connectivity demands of the next-generation applications and devices.

Intellectual Merit: The main goal is to provide undergraduates with an increased opportunity to delve in practical interdisciplinary research projects. The data gained from these interdisciplinary research themes will benefit both the general public and the State of Delaware through the generation of useful information on an assortment of synthetically useful hazardous chemical intermediates and commonly used bio-active pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides. Outcomes could also assist in providing solutions to ongoing water, air, and land pollution and safety concerns in the state. Providing such interesting undergraduate research opportunities should result in an increase in student success and retention for the participating Wesley STEM majors.

Broader Impacts: Wesley serves a population who traditionally have had limited access to higher education. Due to the increased research space, the additional chemical fume-hoods installed, and the availability of Wi-Fi access in Cannon Hall (as a result of grant #0960503); there has been a 52%increase in the number of STEM undergraduates involved in undergraduate research. The Department of Mathematics has also begun the process of initiating both a new minor and a research program in Informatics.

In 2012, there have been 5 peer-reviewed journal publications, 39 scientific poster/oral presentations, and the Wesley College STEM students and faculty earned 17 national or regional awards, certificates, or recognitions, for research outcomes. Additionally, the Oct. 2012 issue of the UK based journal International Innovations, ""Edifying Education: Creating a firm foundation for educational excellence in North America,"" featured an article (pp. 86-88) on the Wesley College - STEM Directed Research Program entitled, ""Teaching/Experiment: Helping Underrepresented STEM Undergraduates.""

276,"U-Pb laser ablation geochronology has become the most commonly applied tool for dating zircons. Despite the widespread application of this tool to a host of geological problems, there is little consensus with regard to analytical strategies and data reduction protocols. The result is inter-laboratory bias and both under- and over-estimation of errors on calculated dates. This limits our ability to compare results from different labs and limits rigorous compilations from databases such as EarthChem. This project will remedy this situation by developing cyber infrastructure tools in support of Laser-Ablation ICP-Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The project will develop open-source, free, software in consultation with the international community to treat with statistical rigor all aspects of data reduction, from calculation of ratios to correction for interferences and drift. Our approach will follow that used in developing similar software as part of the EARTHTIME project and requires the integration of the fields of software engineering and geochemistry. The resulting software will eliminate large sources of interlaboratory bias and serve as a teaching tool showing clearly how raw ratios are converted into dates and uncertainties.

Creating the software for connecting the LA-ICP-MS community with the developing EarthChem database for geochronology and thermochronology will provide the integration of data from this important technique into the larger data structure of geochemistry and geology. These data will play an important role in far-ranging fields such as understanding the growth of continents, chronology of evolutionary changes, timing of early hominid evolution, and linkages between climate and tectonics. During all phases of the planned work, we will involve a broad cross section of the community from undergraduates to post-doctoral scientists to help develop the next generation of analysts and software engineers.

There have been six main activities:

1. Develop a mathematically rigourous data reduction scheme.

2. Adapt a software system developed by the ID-TIMS community (Redux) to incorporate this new LA-ICPMS data reduction scheme.

3. Test the system and create new capabilities with data from the Arizona LaserChron Center.

4. Develop capabilities for Redux to feed data direcly into Geochron, which is a geochronology database operated by the EarthChem initiative.  

5. While Redux is being developed, populate Geochron with legacy data such that the database will eventually contain all published data.  

6. Encourage the broader LA-ICPMS geochronology community to become familiar with Redux and participate in its development.  

These activities have been conducted as a collaboration between four PI's:

-- Jim Bowring (College of Charleston): responsible for Redux programming, and organizer of 2013 workshop for Redux development

-- Sam Bowring (Massachusetts Institute of Technology): develop data reduction scheme with robust error propagation (together with PhD student Noah MacLean)

-- Doug Walker (University of Kansas): maintain Geochron database  and develop linkages with Redux

-- George Gehrels (University of Arizona): Test Redux with data from the Arizona LaserChron Center, upload data into Geochron, and co-organize 2011 and 2013 workshops for Redux development

Excellent progress has been made on all objectivities.  Outcomes from activities at the University of Arizona are as follows:

1. U-Pb data from the Arizona LaserChron Center have now been processed through Redux with accurate results and robust error propogation. Continuing development efforts focus on enhanced visualizations, accomodation of variable data-acquisition formats, and creation of training materials.

2. Uploading of U-Pb data from over 1200 legacy samples from around the world.  This is a significant percentage of the previously published geochronologic data. 

3.  Co-organized two international workshops (August 2011 in Prague and 2013 in Charleston) that have highlighted the develpoment of Redux and the Geochron database.  

In terms of Broader Impacts, the primary contribution has been the involvement of three MS students (Clare Tochilin, Chen Li, and Intan Yokelson) in developing Redux and using it to upload legacy U-Pb data into the Geochron database.

In general, the number and capabilities of new instruments have led to dramatic growth in the size and number of available data sets. Laser-Ablation ICP Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICPMS), with its high spatial resolution and high sample throughput, has been at the forefront of this new wave of data: Uranium-Thorium-Lead (U-Th-Pb) geochronology by laser ablation has become the most commonly applied tool for dating zircons, producing tens to hundreds of thousands of analyses per year and constraining a host of geological problems. The LA-ICPMS community is now faced with archiving these data and, more importantly, ensuring that data meet the highest standards for precision and accuracy and that interlaboratory biases are minimized. However, there is little consensus with regard to analytical strategies and data reduction protocols for U-Th-Pb laser ablation geochronology. The result is systematic interlaboratory bias and both underestimation and overestimation of uncertainties on calculated dates that, in turn, decrease the value of data repositories such as EarthChem hosting data from various laboratories. 

With this grant, we sought to remedy this situation by developing cyberinfrastructure tools in support of LA-ICPMS U-Pb geochronology. We produced an open-source, free software system named ET_Redux with input from the international Earth Science community. Our approach built on our successful strategy used in developing the precursor software (U-Pb_Redux) as part of the EARTHTIME project for U-Pb Isotope Dilution Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry   (ID-TIMS) data reduction.  ET_Redux extends and renames U-Pb_Redux and is cyberinfrastructure that provides a one-stop destination for reducing, examining, archiving, reporting, and compiling conventional ID-TIMS and LA-ICPMS U-Pb data. 

ET_Redux treats with statistical rigor all aspects of data reduction, from calculation of corrected isotopic ratios to correction for interferences and drift.  ET_Redux automates the analytical and scientific workflows of data acquisition, statistical filtering, data analysis and interpretation, publication, community-based archiving, and the compilation and comparison of data from different laboratories to support collaborative science.  The ET_Redux system implements techniques that support the seamless federation of analytical results from many labs into the public archival database Geochron.org using standard and open techniques. These techniques include the universal identification of geological samples, transparent data reduction algorithms, robust data formats, Internet-based storage and retrieval, and transparent compilation and aggregation techniques for analysis of records retrieved from the database. 

With this grant, we developed ET_Redux to support the end-to-end processing of LA-ICPMS U-Th-Pb geochronologic data. ET_Redux ingests raw data files produced by mass spectrometer software packages and provides interactive visualizations and statistical filtering of background and on-peak measured counts and ratios, including interactive fitting of parametric functions to measured ratios of both individual reference material and unknown sample acquisitions. The software produces visualizations of the reference material for the session and provides for fitting parametric or spline functions to the session-scale drift in elemental and isotopic fractionation. ET_Redux corrects for common lead with model isotopic compositions selected by the user, and then generates a customizable data table and visualizations such as concordia and probability density/ kernel density plots, with support for sample date interpretations using weighted means and upper/lower intercepts. As in the case of ID-TIMS analyses, the user can interact with Geochron.org to archive data and results.

As an example of how ET_Redux supports day-to-day research, consider the following scenario: a variety of researchers individually processing samples with either ID-TIMS or LA- ICPMS techniques used ET_Redux to analyze and interpret results for samples from somewhere in Arizona. With unique sample identifiers supplied by the System for Earth Sample Registration (SESAR), the researchers upload the data and analytical interpretations to the public portion of the EarthChem Geochron database using ET_Redux. Sometime later, an individual researcher queries SESAR or Geochron for a set of registered samples for the same general geographic area in Arizona. The researcher then uses this set of identifiers with the ET_Redux system to retrieve data sets from the Geochron database and to compile results from both ID-TIMS and LA-ICPMS analyses in a common analytical and visualization interface. This compilation mode is one of the major contributions of ET_Redux, because it provides for user-friendly and robust visualization tools that support the integration of data from diverse sources. We anticipate this will allow researchers to pose and answer new questions about geochronology.

This work demonstrated the value of collaboration among computer scientists and earth scientists in advancing solutions to scientific problems and the value of including undergraduate researchers in the development process. ET_Redux serves as an exemplar system that integrates scientific workflows from raw samples to archival digital repositories. We conducted one international community workshop to help define the problems and will conduct an international workshop in September 2016 to demonstrate the software.

The LIGO Tier-2 center at UWM is available to all members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, including undergraduate and graduate students. Research activities will address issues in cyber-infrastructure and gravitational physics. The enhanced computational facilities will permit deeper and more intensive searches for a wider variety of signals, and may enable the first-ever direct detection of gravitational waves. The instrument development under this award will have considerable impact on the education and training of undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral scientists at UWM and other institutions around the nation. Undergraduate students will be involved in both the instrument development and the associated research program providing exceptional hands-on training in large-scale distributed computing. Access to these computational facilities is also provided via the Open Science Grid for non-LIGO scientists thus adding to the national cyber-infrastructure for scientific research.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SYSTEM,P O BOX 340,Milwaukee,US,Milwaukee,WI04,University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,WI,532010340,47.049,"['Bruce  Allen', 'Alan G Wiseman', 'Jolien D Creighton', 'Xavier  Siemens']",08/17/2009,627906399,1188018,08/31/2013,4900,MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION,1188018,0923409,041188822,Patrick R Brady,P O BOX 340,Milwaukee,US,Milwaukee,WI04,University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,WI,532010340,prbrady@uwm.edu,Patrick,Brady,R,4142296508,pmarrone@nsf.gov,Pedro Marronetti,7032927372,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,"['Salvatore Vitale, Walter Del Pozzo, Tjonnie G.F.

Coastal, Atmospheric, and Marine Environmental Observing Studies

Abstract

The Bodega Marine Laboratory (BML) CAMEOS program connects graduate student research and K-12 science curricula to ocean literacy principles, marine laboratory resources, and environmental technology. BML?s atmospheric, earth, ocean, and computer scientists partner with science education experts to give graduate students life-long skills in inquiry-based teaching, science content, environmental observing technology, and cyber-infrastructure. Graduate fellows then use their own investigations and training to develop motivational research projects that provide field experiences and access to start-of-the-art sensor networks for middle and high school students. Use of new environmental observing systems and cyber-infrastructure transforms STEM teaching at all academic levels by offering exploration and data-gathering tools for field studies, collaboration, and real and ?virtual? research experiences in classrooms and laboratories. K-12 teachers and students are presented with science role models and opportunities to practice all tasks performed by professional scientists, from creating research questions and collecting data to sharing results at scientific conferences.  
Ocean processes are at the heart of global climate predictions and failing fisheries, but are poorly understood by the general public. Broad ocean literacy is needed to build ocean stewardship, strengthen science literacy, and create a new generation of ocean leaders. CAMEOS builds on national ocean and science literacy initiatives, and broadens participation of under-represented graduate and K-12 students in inquiry-based STEM education. Program participants and users of CAMEOS curricula and resources gain a greater understanding of the importance of ocean processes, technological tools, and research to their daily lives, science education, resource management, and environmental stewardship.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS",OR/Sponsored Programs,Davis,US,Davis,CA03,University of California-Davis,CA,956186134,47.076,"['Claudia A Luke', 'Victor  Chow', 'Michael  Gertz', 'Bertram  Ludaescher']",04/03/2009,047120084,2226045,03/31/2015,4900,GRAD TEACHING FELLOWS IN K-12,2812762,0841297,003985512,Susan L Williams,OR/Sponsored Programs,Davis,US,Davis,CA03,University of California-Davis,CA,956186134,slwilliams@ucdavis.edu,Susan,Williams,L,7078751950,lregassa@nsf.gov,Laura Regassa,7032922343,040106 NSF Education & Human Resource,"The CAMEOS project (http://bml.ucdavis.edu/education/cameos/) placed graduate student 'role model scientist' fellows in coastal and marine sciences, environmental sciences, and computer science in K-12 schools, where they were mentored by experienced K-12 teachers and faculty at the University of California-Davis. The project's home was Bodega Marine Laboratory in Bodega Bay, CA. The major goals of the project were: 1) advance the science career development of the graduate students, 2) promote ocean literacy in the US, and 3) help build a global, cross-culturally competent scientific workforce through an international collaboration with a university in Indonesia (Hasanuddin University, Sulawesi).


The project trained 18 fellows (primarily doctoral students) in the best practices of teaching science, science communications, and science ethics (including Human Subject Research), and provided career development skills (time management, collaboration, project organization) while supporting their independent research in diverse fields from marine ecology to environmental toxicology and coastal forestry. Examples of thesis research topics included management of costly marine  invasive species, restoration of essential marine habitats that support  fisheries and recreation, techniques to determine toxic effects on sea  life, and management of coastal forests. Project alumni received presitigious, nationally-competitive fellowships (including Fulbright) and awards and honors. Fellows now occupy positions in academia, government, and the computer science industry. The fellows also contributed to public outreach through news media, briefing managers, policy makers and elected officials, and volunteerism in their communities including in public school enrichment and coastal clean-up programs.

K-12 Science and Mathematics Education- The project served 12 schools with approximately 600 students (K6-12) in each of five years in northern California. On average, 34% of the students of these schools were Hispanic (range: 0-79%), 38% were economically disadvantaged (range: 7-93%), and 13% had limited English proficiency (range: 1-50%). Through participation, students expressed more positive views of science as a profession and importantly, gained great confidence in their abilities to do challenging independent work, and gained enhanced mathematics, analytical, and communication skills (including enhanced English).

Global, cross-culturally competent scientific workforce- As the world becomes increasingly interconnected and US companies need to compete in such a world, it is a priority to build a global scientific workforce. The project helped build an international cross-cultural workforce through its collaboration with an Indonesian university, in which 17 US scientists participated, ranging from MS-level through faculty. These scientists gained a multicultural experience, put science communication skills to practice, received practical training in coral reef, seagrass, and marine biodiversity research, and helped build science capacity in a fast-growing, developing nation. The project reached over 200 islanders living traditionally and approximately 300 K-12 students through outreach on the marine environment and science and SCUBA diving physiology for island fishers who had no previous knowledge of diving-related illnesses. The project also collaborated with Mars, Inc. to provide private business experience for participants and to help develop alternative livelihoods to destructive and diminishing fisheries resources.

280,"With the proliferation of wireless sensor networks and mobile devices enabled by global positioning systems (GPSs), the volume of real-time geo-referenced streams being collected is large and continues to increase. Individual readings from sensors represent discrete sampling points, whereas the phenomena that sensor networks monitor (e.g., floods, fires, and ocean currents) are often spatially and temporally continuous. 

This project aims at bridging the impedance mismatch of discrete sensor readings and the continuous phenomena. Specifically, we will explore incremental methods to detect and maintain evolving regions from discrete sensor readings in real time. This task is challenging and risky because (1) human intervention, which is important for region detection, needs to be minimal for the targeted monitoring applications; and (2) the alerting nature requires real-time responses, especially in disastrous situations when volumes of data are often high. The quality of service (QoS) requirement in terms of response time and accuracy of the regions detected needs to be balanced.

A novel idea of virtual sensor insertion will be explored to improve the accuracy of region detection. To reduce human intervention, the system will be equipped with a learning ability by using and maintaining statistics needed for incremental polygonization. Measurements in information retrieval will be explored creatively for identifying qualitative region evolvements and creating region evolvement graph, which will result in a reduced number of alerts sent to users.

The expected results will bridge the semantic gap of discrete readings and natural phenomena as well as provide a foundation for future work in geo-stream processing. Once the results are integrated into a geo-stream processing system, users can monitor evolving regions without being confined to querying discrete readings. The work will help sustain the growth of and support important time-critical applications such as disaster response and surveillance. Graduate students will be trained on various aspects of geo-stream processing.

282,"Visualizing Scientific Discovery Workshop
Susan E. Cozzens, Georgia Institute of Technology
The development of visualization tools made possible by advances in cyber-infrastructure offer intriguing possibilities for tracking the impact of
investments in science. These possibilities range from tracing the path from basic research discoveries to patents and innovation, to the changing structure of scientific disciplines, and from examining the importance of social networks to the dispersion of scientific innovations to comparators of international performance in science.
The potential contribution to NSF programs is far-reaching. Program
officers could use information from such tools to examine whether one particular type or level of investment has been better than another for achieving a particular short-term outcome, use the information to restructure or balance their funding portfolio, as well as to provide information to outside queries about the value of particular investments. In addition, NSF staff could use the tools to describe the impact of cross-cutting initiatives, such as cyber-infrastructure and ITR. NSF staff might also be able to expand by mapping the complex structures of multidisciplinary collaborations and using the information to identify members of scientifically dispersed communities as well as emerging leaders in science and innovation.
However, before such a vision is achieved, many questions remain about
the robustness, validity and usability of the visualization tools. The workshop is designed to bring researchers from a broad range of disciplines to examine the open questions.

exciting area of the social sciences, surveying the current state of the art and identifying key issues for further development.

As part of their Fellowship, GK-12 Fellows are paired with participating GK12 teachers the Worcester Public Schools (WPS) to develop new content for the ASSISTment System. This System innovatively uses the amount of tutoring a student needs to answer questions as an assessment of their understanding of mathematics and science. The students working with the Fellows will learn about implementing technology and how to conduct Learning Sciences experiments in classrooms. The cooperating teachers will increase their content knowledge, and this will contribute to their professional growth.

First, many graduate students were trained under the program using  the  GK12 method of sending them to work in K-12 classroom. They learned communication skills through that process.
            WPIÆs implementation of our GK12 project had additional unique features not found in the typical GK12 project. Graduate students mostly did research work on ASSISTments and gained valuable experiences in observing it's use which helped design new software features, and conducted experiments to see if these improvements lead to better student achievement.
           Some of the outputs included: the ASSISTments cyber-infrastructure; open data sets; scientific contributions (ie papers); and some great graduate students.
 
            We talk about the ASSISTments cyber-infrastructure which during the project has morphed from a project used by WPI to conduct scientific research to an open scientific platforms used by 10 different universities. Said another way, the system used to benefit the PIÆs (Neil Heffernan) CV but now benefits over a dozen scientific researchers in doing their work.  On July 28, 2014, Dr. Heffernan held a webinar for 58 education researchers to explain how they can conduct their own randomized controlled experiments using the ASSISTments platform and its ""subject pool"" of 50,000. Some might cringe at the use of the word ""subject pool"" to describe a group of mostly middle school students, but Dr. Heffernan tries to remind the public that teachers are experimenting on millions everyday with their own new teaching ideas. WPI is doing so while simultaneously trying to collect the data necessary to monitor what is working.  In all cases WPI is comparing normal instructional strategies (such as what types of hints are most effective at encouraging learning?  Does a video work better than text?).  The GK12 project helped ASSISTments get to the point where it could turn itself into a tool used by a  community of education researchers to help the community learn what works.

We talk about OPEN data sets. ASSISTments promotes OPEN science by removing all personal identification information (student/teacher names, etc) from its data sets and sharing them with the world.  At the Educational Data Mining Conferences, Dr. Heffernan was pleased to see scientific papers (two listed below) written by others that used his released data.

We talk about scientific publications.  In addition to building an infrastructure to do scientific research, we have ourselves used that infrasture to contribute dozens of scientific publications to the literature.  These publications can broadly be categorized as one of two types.  First, there are the randomized controlled trials where we compare two instructional strategies, to see which is better.  For instance, are video hints better than text hints  (where the content of the tutoring messages are the exact same and differ only by their presentation in a YouTube video or HTML text).  We have reported about a dozen of these studies, and GK12 fellows helped in many of them.
The second type of studies can be called ""data mining"" studies or the reporting of novel ways of using educational data to predict things that matter.  For instance, can we better predict studentsÆ knowledge if we use what we call the ""Prior Per Student"" model.  The answer was ""yes!, we can!).

The project has shown very positive results related to field tests of student STEM-concept learning and interests, as well as increased teacher knowledge in problem-based learning, robotics, and STEM concepts. Thirteen refereed publications have resulted to date for showcasing these results, including significant contributions to a 2012 international book called Robots in K12 Education: A New Technology for Learning. 
The SPIRIT projectÆs intellectual merit lies in the development of its replicable curriculum model and open-source robotics platform for teaching mathematics and science concepts using educational robotics at the middle school level.  The educational robotics platform developed is relatively flexible, inexpensive, and expandable and is called the CEENBoT (Computer and Electronics Engineering Robot).  It is now being produced routinely by a University of Nebraska startup company (CEENBoT Inc.) which was also established as a direct outcome of the project.  The CEENBoT robotics platform itself includes the capability to be programmed in many different ways for students, including by use of a TI Graphing Calculator, an Application Programming Interface (API) or an open-source Graphical Programming Interface (GPI), which allows for a diversity of programming options that can control numerous add-on devices to the robot, such as sensors and cameras.  The open-source environment of the CEENBoT platform allows the students to find new parts from commercial hobby stores or electronics outlets, and to use their own creativity in platform expansion.  The SPIRIT project has also established a wide array of instructional materials and assessments supporting this open-source platform for STEM learning.

 
For its broader impacts, the SPIRIT project has also now directly supported intense professional  development activities for more than 500 mathematics and science  teachers (primarily middle school) in educational robotics, in extended  multi-day workshops, that have also led to some very creative ideas for  the teaching of STEM concepts and topics.  Many  of these SPIRIT teachers have even started their own educational  robotics courses, programs or after school programs at their local  schools, based on their positive experiences with the project.  
In support of these impacts, the SPIRIT project has also held five different annual Nebraska Robotics  Expos, that have directly engaged more than 10,000 youth in educational  robotics competitions and showcase events.  This impressive event was even showcased in 2013, by public television, and that video can be accessed at: 
http://www.nelovesps.org/watchnow?TN=PROJECT-20130226111910

The SPIRIT project has also contributed more than 300 comprehensive educational robotics modules, which have been developed, as well as tested and refined by SPIRIT teachers for instructional delivery within an interactive cyberinfrastructure that is also linked to specific released standardized test questions in mathematics and science for assessment.  The lesson cyberinfrastructure for the SPIRIT 2.0 Project includes an innovative modular lesson design, that partitions lessons into five components, including A - asking questions, E &ndash; exploring learning, I &ndash; instructing learning, O &ndash; organizing learning, and U &ndash; understanding what has been learned.  Lessons can be easily searched and combined by a teacher, along with a variety of classroom assessments that can be used to create a tailor-made sequence of activities for classroom learning.  Each of the lessons is also professionally illustrated and even includes humorous content-related cartoons that further provide insight into STEM concepts.

286,"This project applies recent techniques in transactional computing to the problem of preventing unwanted declassification of secure information. Regulating the nature and amount of information that is declassified for complex software system is difficult; even when leaks are identified, suitably repairing the computation is usually not possible. The project develops ideas inspired from language-centric transactional computing to support information flow security by encapsulating critical regions that (a) either cannot be analyzed effectively statically or (b) declassify some set of confidential data. Isolation and atomicity properties of transactional regions ensure the approach is safe even in a multi-threaded environment.
The technical issues associated with controlled declassification are examined from an entirely new perspective--rather than attempting to prevent statically any leaks from occurring, this research explores approaches that dynamically monitor when leaks occur, transparently reverting program state to an earlier safe context when leaks are identified. This security model encapsulates untrusted operations and library functions within monitored regions, allowing only information explicitly marked as declassified to escape the region scope. As regions run in isolation, they ensure that they can not be influenced by non-monitored code, nor can they influence its outcome. The monitoring infrastructure leverages transactional mechanisms to track memory use, and restore program state when declassification violations are detected.
The broader impacts are significant. Information flow and declassification are critical problems to cyber-infrastructure, homeland security, and commercial interests. Techniques that provide scalable, transparent, and effective solutions to this problem are of immediate benefit to current government and business initiatives.",NSF,4900,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,Young Hall,West Lafayette,US,West Lafayette,IN04,Purdue University,IN,479072114,47.070,"['Suresh  Jagannathan', 'Antonio  Cunei']",08/08/2007,072051394,249857,08/31/2010,4900,CYBER TRUST,249857,0716659,072051394,Jan  Vitek,Young Hall,West Lafayette,US,West Lafayette,IN04,Purdue University,IN,479072114,j.vitek@neu.edu,Jan,Vitek,,6173732462,clandweh@nsf.gov,carl landwehr,7032920000,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,"['S.

292,"This project provides Jackson State University (JSU) researchers with a campus cyber infrastructure (CI) capability allowing expansion of big data and other network intensive collaborative research that depend on high-speed network access to local, regional, cloud and national compute and storage resources.  The project increases research network capacity to 100G, re-architects the campus research network, and strategic relocation of equipment to utilize a Science DMZ (Demilitarized zone - i.e., free from firewalls and other friction devices).  The research network includes centrally pooled High-Performance/Throughput Computing (HPC/HTC) resources designed to meet immediate and future research needs.  An increased focus on domain scientist talent is possible due to management and monitoring of the CI assets by a centralized, well-trained enterprise information technology team. This project enhances the end-to-end network services for researchers and is an important catalyst for the growing campus-wide interdisciplinary data science program. 

Application-specific network and computational needs for big data analytics, visualization, nanotoxicity, complex network analysis, science drivers and education are addressed.

293,"This SCC-Planning project will be design a human-centered service system, using the existing cyber infrastructure of a transportation hub. Users will be assisted by an ""app"" for navigating complicated buildings and urban spaces.  With this app, the visually impaired, whose numbers exceed 6 million individuals today, will find using public transportation services more convenient and efficient.  There are significant hurdles to be overcome to realize this design, called the Smart and Accessible Transportation Hub (SAT-Hub), which will extend an individual's mobility, offer greater freedom of movement, and open new possibilities for daily living and community engagement. In addition, the SAT-Hub will provide unique, interdisciplinary training opportunities for students, including under-represented populations in STEM at CUNY City College, CUNY Borough of Manhattan Community College and Rutgers.

The planning for the SAT-Hub will bring together several technical areas: smart infrastructures and sensing and computing with transportation planning and accessibility and mobility. The project has three main objectives: (1) design a smart transportation hub framework for experimenting, debugging, and refining the smart service, (2) strengthen partnerships with community stakeholders by exploring the unique needs of their user communities through regular community engagement, and (3) identify cross-disciplinary, integrative research themes to enable the successful deployment of a solution.

294,"Data sets produced by modern space missions and ground-based telescopes are so large and complex that they threaten to overwhelm astronomers' ability to analyze them.  In response, the astronomy and IT communities are actively engaged in developing powerful new tools that can process these data.  The Montage Image Mosaic Engine is a participant in this community of next generation tool development.  Up to now, Montage has been used for high-performance processing of images, so that astronomers can take small images and create a mosaic that reveals the structure of a large region of the sky.  With this new funding, Montage will be extended from a processing engine into a ""one-stop shopping"" toolkit that will enable astronomers to manage their image data as well as process them.  They will be able to analyze their data and repair defects found in them, discover and access datasets released worldwide that will make analysis of their own data more valuable, compare and integrate their data sets with other data in web browsers, create their own data archives that can be accessed, as required, by team members or the public, and process large scale image mosaics through an on-demand service that will be hosted by a new astronomy data sharing platform called SciServer.  All these features will dramatically reduce the overhead needed in managing data and will lead to a corresponding increase in productivity.  Montage will at the same time retain all its existing capabilities.  Montage is written as a toolkit rather than as an application, so astronomers can use each of its functions independently of each other and embed them in their processing environments.  It is written in a language, C, that optimizes processing, runs on all Unix based operating systems used by all astronomers, and functions just as well on single machines as on massive computational facilities.  These features enable Montage to be used by astronomers analyzing data on their desktops as well as by teams of scientists creating complex, massive new data sets for distribution to the astronomy community.  One example is its use in the analysis of images to detect new near-Earth asteroids.  It has also been taken up by the computer science community, who use it as an example of a real-world application in driving the development of powerful new cyberinfrastructure platforms for processing massive scientific data sets.  One of the important current topics in scientific software is how to make powerful new tools sustainable so that they can be updated and used over many years.  Montage is a potential model of sustainable software, and is active in national debates on approaches to sustainability.  A version of Montage will be developed that will operate on Windows platforms, used by educators and students.  This brings Montage to high-school students, youth and amateur astronomers.  Partnerships have been built with two groups of educators who will work to integrate Montage into tools used by high-school students.  For example, Montage will be integrated into tools used by students and youth to process images through a network of educational telescopes called SkyNet.

This project will deploy new functionality currently existing as proof-of-concept prototypes, developed as a result of community input, that will transform Montage into a ""data and metadata access, data management and curation toolkit in a box,"" while retaining all its current image processing functionality.  The new functions are: discovery and acquisition of data at scale in space and in time, using R-tree based indexing schemes; tools for analyzing and repairing metadata; tools for visualizing sky coverage of multiple data sets; migration of an on-demand image mosaic service from IPAC to operate at scale on the SciServer platform; investigation of processing images in browsers with Javascript-enabled tools, and the development of custom image processing environments. Finally, a Windows-enabled version of Montage will be delivered.  Montage will continue to have all the benefits of its architecture.  It is written in C for portability and sustainability, is highly scalable and delivered as a toolkit that is easy to incorporate into processing environments.  Montage is the only mosaic engine with all these characteristics.  It is delivered with an Open Source BSD 3-clause license and accessible on GitHub.  Development uses rigorous software engineering methods, and exploits a hybrid of the evolutionary prototyping and staged delivery development models.  Astronomy data sets are becoming much larger and at the same time more complex.  Montage will provide the tools to access, discover and manage data sets and their metadata.  Many more datasets will be made accessible in this way, and astronomers will be able to develop their own data access services without the overhead of maintaining a database.  Because it is written in ANSI-C and has structured inputs and outputs, astronomers will be able to integrate it into any *nix-based platform or environment to support data management and integration.  The capability to search in space and time will be of immense value in querying upcoming time-domain data sets such as ZTF and LSST.  The on-demand service will be an exemplar of deploying image processing services at scale.  Thus, Montage will be of value to large missions and projects, as well as the long-tail of scientists working in small groups.  The impact of Montage will be measured by tracking growth in citations to Montage, and to the creation of data sets that use the software, and by tracking usage of services and environments that use Montage as part of their underpinnings.  Montage is having considerable impact on broad intellectual and educational areas outside astronomical research: (1) Advancing Learning and Discovery- It is used in developing Education and Public Outreach products such as a 5-color Galactic Plane image of Herschel data.  It has found applicability in undergraduate research projects.  The Windows version will bring Montage to high-school students, youth and amateur astronomers.  Browser processing of images may lead to more sophisticated Citizen Science projects; (2) Dissemination to Enhance Scientific and Technological Understanding- It is recognized as an example of sustainable software, and the development team is active in national debates on the issues of software transparency and sustainability; (3) Enhancing Infrastructure for Research and Education- Montage is an exemplar application used to develop national cyber-infrastructure.",NSF,4900,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,1200 E California Blvd,PASADENA,US,Pasadena,CA27,California Institute of Technology,CA,911250600,47.070,,09/08/2016,009584210,499795,09/30/2019,4900,Software Institutes,499795,1642453,009584210,Graham B Berriman,,,US,Pasadena,CA27,California Institute of Technology,CA,911250600,gbb@ipac.caltech.edu,Graham,Berriman,B,6263951817,mbeck@nsf.gov,micah beck,7032920000,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,"['Chiozzi, Gianluca and Guzman, Juan C. and Berriman, G.

295,"This project will support the continued development of the Cooperating Computing Tools (CCTools)software, which provides scientists with the ability to distribute existing simulation and analysis software codes to large numbers of computers in commercial clouds, advanced supercomputers, or both.  As a result, research in fields such as physics, biology, and chemistry can be accelerated, in some cases, by a hundred- or even a thousand-fold.  Staff and students involved in this project will develop new software capabilities and work closely with scientific communities to improve their productivity in advanced computing facilities.  The project will also help to develop a technical workforce by training graduate and undergraduate students in advanced software engineering skills.

Today's computational scientist has access to an extraordinary range of computing facilities, including thousands of cores and petabytes of storage drawn from commercial cloud providers, university clusters, or national computing resources. However, end users often want to connect these systems in ways that the designers did not anticipate. They may wish to access data at one facility, run software at a second facility, and store the results at yet another. However, combining infrastructure is much harder than it ought to be, because most resources assume that their users only live within that particular closed world. Programs built in one environment may not run in another; data stored in one system may not be accessible in another; specialized programming models may be fast on one machine, but useless on another machine. Researchers do not want to be tied down to a single system; rather, they want standard programs to execute easily across all environments. This project will create new features and support users of the Cooperating Computing Tools (CCTools) software which provides scientific users with the ability to harness large scale cyber-infrastructure for data intensive scientific applications. The key components are the Parrot virtual filesystem, the Makeflow workflow system, and the Work Queue application framework. These components can be used separately or together to take existing POSIX applications and scale them up from a single laptop all the way to national scale infrastructure. This project will advance the development of the CCTools software to meet the changing technology landscape in three key respects: exploiting container technologies, making efficient use of local concurrency, and performing capacity management at the workflow scale. This grant will support a small team of students and staff who will engage user communities to understand their needs, sustain and extend the software on current cyberinfrastructure, and perform outreach and education to users both new and old. The project will focus on active user communities in high energy physics, which rely on Parrot for global scale filesystem access in campus clusters and the Open Science Grid; bioinformatics users executing complex workflows via the VectorBase, LifeMapper, and CyVerse disciplinary portals, and ensemble molecular dynamics applications that harness GPUs from XSEDE and commercial

296,"Research workflows across many domains from life sciences to social and behavioral sciences, are scaling to require more computational analysis of much larger data sets. Workflows that have leveraged local computation and data storage resources must be transformed to use larger shared compute facilities like the UC Berkeley Savio supercomputing cluster, and national centers like NERSC and XSEDE. However, researchers have struggled to connect their data sources (such as laboratory instruments, remote data-sets, etc.) to the shared computation and storage resources in an efficient, productive workflow. Barriers range from poor network throughput, to inexperience with data management and shared computing infrastructure and best practices.

The Berkeley Research Computing (BRC) program is adding cyber-infrastructure engineering support to engage research groups to understand their needs, and to design and implement effective workflows that take advantage of campus and national computation and data management resources. These research engagements transform existing workflows to advance project-specific research goals, but also provide concrete templates that other research groups can leverage, and an architectural pattern for research engagement going forward.

The BRC CI Engineer leverages campus resources including a Science DMZ that connects high-speed state and national network links, including California's Advanced Research and Education Network (CENIC) and the Energy Sciences Network (ESNet), to campus infrastructure, including the BRC Savio supercomputing cluster. The BRC CI Engineer draws upon campus expertise in networking, high-performance computing, and research data management, as well as the domain expertise of campus partners.

297,"The use of polymers, their composites, and nanostructures is growing at a fast pace, both by displacing traditional materials and by enabling emerging technologies. Examples range from the all-composite airframe of the Boeing 787 and the new Airbus 350 to wearable electronics. This project aims to develop a software infrastructure to simulate these materials with atomic resolution and make these tools universally accessible and useful via on-line computing. These simulations have the potential to accelerate the development of optimized material formulations that can benefit society and reduce the associated costs by combining physical with computational experiments. Making these advanced tools available for free online simulations and complementing them with tutorials and educational material will encourage their use in the classroom and will impact the education of new generations of engineers and scientists familiar with these powerful tools that will be required to address tomorrow's challenges.

The objective of this effort is to enable pervasive, reproducible molecular simulations of polymeric materials using state-of-the-art tools and with quantified uncertainties building on recent breakthroughs in molecular simulations, cyber-infrastructure and uncertainty quantification. The framework will consist of three main components: i) powerful simulation tools for polymer nano structures including: state-of-the-art molecular builders, a parallel MD engine with stencils that enable efficient structure relaxation and property characterization and post-processing codes; ii) a UQ framework to orchestrate the molecular simulations and propagate uncertainties in input parameters to predictions and compare the predictions to experimental values; iii) databases of force fields and molecular structures as well as predicted and experimental properties. The simulation framework will be deployed via NSF's nanoHUB where users will be able to run online simulations without downloading or installing any software while expert users will have the option to download, modify and contribute to the infrastructure.

Continuing education workshops, certificate programs on surface science and engineering, and education-level appropriate outreach activities will be offered to train industry professionals, K-12 teachers and students across AR.  Existing statewide cyber-infrastructure will be used to support research and expand education across the state to enhance technology-based economic prosperity in AR.  

Technical Description
The proposed research focuses on the design, fabrication, and study of nanostructured surfaces that change color, self-sharpen, lubricate, or change pore size as needed for specific applications.  The project team will explore a wide range of material surface innovations inspired by nature (for example, lotus leaves for water repulsion, sea shells for their load bearing capacity, and chameleons for changing skin color) and controlled by external stimuli.  Modeling and simulation based surface design will guide experiments and provide fundamental understanding of meso- to nano-scale material behavior. The project will leverage statewide research involving ten AR higher education institutions to produce novel materials and a database of their properties, which can be shared with industries to accelerate product innovations.  CASE researchers will educate graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, prepare curricular materials to train industry professionals, and develop a cross-institutional certificate program in surface science and engineering.",NSF,4900,ARKANSAS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AUTHORITY,900 West Capitol Avenue,Little Rock,US,Little Rock,AR02,Arkansas Science & Technology Authority,AR,722013108,47.083,['Min  Zou'],07/31/2015,619312569,20000000,07/31/2020,4900,EPSCoR Research Infrastructure,20000000,1457888,065320400,Steve  Stanley,,,US,Little Rock,AR02,Arkansas Science & Technology Authority,AR,722019708,sstanley@arkansasedc.com,Steve,Stanley,,5016834408,jsmall@nsf.gov,Jeanne Small,7032920000,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,"['Jingyi Chen, Xia J, Stephen A, Dimitrov N~Impact of Structure and Composition on the De-alloying of CuxAu(1-x) Bulk and Nanoscale Alloys~Journal J.

301,"Duke University and the Organization for Tropical Studies have been awarded a grant to purchase four pieces of specialized scientific equipment that will enhance research at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. Specific research that will benefit from the acquisition of these instruments include nitrogen fixation by soil microorganisms, effects of chemical and phylogenetic diversity of plants in the structure of herbivore community and herbivory, microbial diversity in tank bromeliads and mutualistic associations between hemiptera and Burholderia bacteria, and amphibian decline.
La Selva is owned and operated by the Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS), a non-profit consortium of nearly sixty universities, colleges, and research institutions located at Duke University; it was founded in 1963 to provide leadership in education, research, and the responsible use of natural resources in the tropics. OTS maintains three biological research stations in Costa Rica. La Selva, the largest of the three (comprised of 3900 acres of tropical wet forests and disturbs lands), has been recognized as one of the most scientifically productive field stations in the tropics. Few research stations have access to both diverse tropical forest settings and sophisticated research capabilities as La Selva, and it is this unique setting and infrastructure, combined with long-term data sets from nearly fifty years of research, that makes this station situated along the land-bridge between two major continents, so important. The new equipment will enable the station to remain at the forefront of research and eliminate the need to transport samples abroad for analysis. It will enhance exponentially opportunities for the wide array of research projects currently taking place at the station, open new lines of research, and expand the exciting questions researchers and students can ask in the decade ahead while working in a remote tropical lowland rain forest. 
Over the last 10 years, the number of staff and visitors (researchers, research assistants, eco-tourists) to La Selva has varied between ~ 28 and 36 thousand a year. Annually, students from more than 115 faculty-led courses from colleges and universities from the United States utilize La Selva's forests and laboratories as part of their curriculum. In addition, each year, OTS itself runs approximately 15 graduate and undergraduate courses and a ten-week site-based research experience for undergraduates (REU) program for students from non-R1 research universities and groups under-represented in the sciences. In fact, over the last five years, 24% of all U.S. undergraduates in the OTS education programs are from under-represented groups in the STEM disciplines. The station has sponsored several working groups on tropical ecotoxicology, multi-trophic interaction diversity, and bioinformatics and databases. It has hosted a number of multi-institutional collaborations and workshops that involve scientists from all over the world. Therefore, the requested equipment will provide an enriching educational, long-lasting research experience for students and researchers, and potentially lead to new discoveries in tropical field biology.

McCartney,7032928470,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"This  grant of $65,000 from the Field Station and Marine Laboratories Program at NSF enabled the Organization for Tropical Studies to acquire four pieces of specialized scientific equipment (ultra-low freezer, gas chromatograph, PCR workstation, and thermal cycler) to enhance research at its La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. For forty-five years La Selva has been one of the most important research sites in the Neotropics, and for more than four decades it has sought to both improve its research facilities and enhance the scientific equipment available to researchers and students in order to support world-class research. The stationÆs two primary laboratories constructed with grants from NSF in the late 1970s and early 1980s respectively, were renovated in 2012 with support from the NSF Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) program. Both laboratories were upgraded to provide fifteen additional research workspaces for researchers and graduate students and more than thirty workstations overall.  In addition, these facilities were enhanced with energy-efficient air conditioners and a large cold room replacing the aging (approximately 20) refrigerators located throughout the two building. Finally, upgraded fume hoods were acquired for the analytical laboratory. As part of the renovations, the room in the analytical lab which served for 35 years as La SelvaÆs ambient laboratory was reconstructed to become the stationÆs new microbiology laboratory. Subsequently, the FSML program awarded a grant to OTS to construct a larger ambient laboratory to provide ambient workspace for researchers and students, segregated spaces to reduce interference among projects, environmental controls (e.g., monitoring and regulation of temperature and humidity, ventilation, and natural light), and improved cyber-infrastructure. 

With improvements to these facilities and expansion of usage capacity, OTS sought to establish the same high quality of scientific equipment available to researchers and students, especially within the analytical laboratory built and outfitted in the early-1980s. The acquisition of improved fume hoods was the first important step in this process. Subsequently, OTS identified four specialized pieces of scientific equipment urgently needed in order for the station to take full advantage of its renovated laboratories and the increasing demand from researchers, graduate and REU students and faculty teaching undergraduate courses.  Two of the pieces (the ultra-low freezer and the gas chromatograph) will enhance research within the analytical laboratory itself and two of the pieces (a PCR Workstation and a Thermal Cycler) will enable the microbiology laboratory to become fully functional.

The specialized research equipment will eliminate the difficulty a number of researchers have transporting their samples for analysis back to their home institutions. In addition, the equipment will enhance exponentially the opportunities for a wide array of other research projects currently taking place at the station as well as open new lines of research and expand the exciting questions researchers and students can ask while working in a remote tropical lowland rain forest.

The specialized equipment will not only be used by researchers but also by hundreds of students each year, including students from more than 115 faculty-led courses from colleges and universities from throughout the United States. OTS runs approximately 15 graduate and undergraduate courses each year, which also spend significant time at the station, and OTSÆ site-based REU program for students from non-R1 research universities and groups under-represented in the sciences spend an entire summer utilizing La SelvaÆs laboratories. Therefore, it is safe to say, the equipment purchased through this grant will enable students at La Selva to have an enriching educational, long-lasting experience for years to come.

302,"The International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) serves to advance basic research in the marine geosciences and is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and more than 26 other international partners. IODP builds on a legacy of scientific ocean drilling exemplified by the Deep Sea Drilling Project (1969-1983), the Ocean Drilling Program (1985-2003), and the multi-drilling platform Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (2003-2013).
Ocean drilling is used to examine processes ranging from changes in the Earth's climate to the rifting and drifting of continents. Drilling is the primary tool for sampling sediment and crustal rock from the 70 percent of the Earth?s surface covered by oceans, and is the only technique for sampling anything more than a few meters deeper than the ocean floor. The new IODP commenced October 1, 2013, utilizing the new science plan Illuminating Earth?s Past, Present, and Future (http://www.iodp.org/Science-Plan-for-2013-2023/) based on planning by over 600 international scientists. The plan identifies four themes for initial emphasis in the new IODP: 

1)	Climate and Ocean Change: Reading the Past, Informing the Future 
2)	Biosphere frontiers: Deep Life, Biodiversity, and Environmental Forcing of Ecosystems 
3)	Earth Connections: Deep Processes and Their Impact on Earth?s Surface Environment 
4)	Earth in Motion: Processes and Hazards on Human Time Scales 

Scientific accomplishments in the previous ocean drilling programs and the potential for future scientific discoveries envisioned in this new Science Plan were reviewed in the National Research Council report Scientific Ocean Drilling: Accomplishments and Challenges (2011) (http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13232#toc). The NRC found that ""Each of the four themes within the Science Plan identifies compelling challenges with potential transformative science that can only be addressed by scientific ocean drilling."" The report noted the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program's scope and method of research as an example of best practices in international scientific cooperation.
The refit of the JOIDES Resolution through the MREFC account in 2006-2009 greatly improved the drilling capabilities of the vessel, with a number of new drilling depth records subsequently set and substantial improvement in core recovery and quality. The depth to which the drillship can obtain high-resolution climate records in core has doubled, expanding the ability to examine Earth's climate history in detail. The scientific capabilities have also been enhanced, with addition of a new microbiology lab, a new data management infrastructure with significant cyber-infrastructure upgrades, a 25% increase in core processing area and berths, and new or enhanced scientific analytical instruments in every shipboard laboratory. Vessel and drill rig reliability have proven robust, with virtually 100% facility availability during operations.
The JOIDES Resolution, Chikyu, and Mission-Specific Platform (MSP) drilling platforms will continue to be provided to IODP by NSF, Japan, and the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling, respectively. The new science plan draws upon lessons from previous programs to build a streamlined multi-platform international program based on cooperation rather than integration. IODP planning for JOIDES Resolution operations is conducted under a Facilities Board, and management and funding for JOIDES Resolution operations will occur independently of the other IODP drilling platforms. The JOIDES Resolution Facilities Board (JR FB) is led by a member of the science community and made up of scientists and governmental representatives of nations contributing to JOIDES Resolution operations, as well as representatives of the JOIDES Resolution science operator. The Facilities Board is advised by the Science Evaluation and Environmental Protection and Safety Panels. The JR FB and its advisory panels will be utilized for proposal review by other science operators in IODP, and are supported by a new IODP Science Support Office under a Cooperative Agreement to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego.
This Cooperative Agreement (CA) provides financial support for Operations Management of the Drilling Vessel JOIDES Resolution for the International Ocean Discovery Program to the Texas A&M Research Foundation, and is intended to cover an initial five year period beginning on July 1, 2014. A CA is being used because of 1) the increased level of involvement NSF expects to have with the Awardee and its principal subawardees and subcontractors in managing facility operations in a tightly constrained budgetary environment; 2) the wish to move facility management to the standard NSF model; and 3) the principal relationship between NSF and the Awardee is to carry out a public purpose, rather than acquiring property or services for the direct benefit of the Government. 
The JOIDES Resolution will operate under a leasing subcontract between the Texas A&M Research Foundation and Overseas Drilling, Limited (ODL), the vessel owner. ODL is owned entirely by Siem Offshore, incorporated in the Cayman Islands. For FY2015, this subcontract has provisions for 8 one-year extensions by the science operator, requiring only 6 months of advance notice to renew for another year. The day rate during these yearly extensions is fixed, increasing only by a balance of the Consumer Price Index- All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) and the Employment Cost Index (ECI) indexed to June 1, 2005, as determined by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This contract structure and low indexed day rate ($60,950/day as of June 1, 2005, when commercial drill ships are currently about $300,000- $700,000/day) substantially reduces financial risk to NSF, and allows for yearly opportunities to terminate the drilling subcontract at low cost.
Technical and budgetary risks to NSF will be further reduced by (1) using a proven facility under an existing drilling contract with known vessel lease costs, (2) obtaining regular, annual program contributions from international partners through non-binding Memoranda; (3) encouraging the Awardee to pursue third party work with private entities that would pay for the use of the vessel, and 4) conducting annual reviews by external panels of the Awardee's overall performance.
NSF will retain ownership of invaluable, actual core and core samples to ensure proper stewardship for future use by scientists. The JOIDES Resolution will operate under the existing June, 2008 Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (valid through June, 2028; http://www.nsf.gov/geo/oce/envcomp/IODP_USIO_Final_PEIS.pdf and http://www.nsf.gov/geo/oce/envcomp/IODP_USIO_Final_PEIS_Appendices.pdf ) and the June 30, 2008 NSF Record of Decision regarding the United States Implementing Organization's Participation in the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (Federal Register, v. 73, n. 126, p. 36919; http://www.nsf.gov/geo/oce/envcomp/IODP_USIO_PEIS_RODv3.pdf ). JOIDES Resolution operations will be indemnified under 42 U.S.C. 1887 and 10 U.S.C 2354, contingent on the Awardee maintaining high levels of insurance coverage.
A Program Review will be held prior to completion of the initial period and the results will guide a decision to re-compete or renew the CA for a second five year period. Fundamental to this Review is the Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences, being conducted under the auspices of the National Research Council, with delivery of its report expected in May, 2015. This Survey will define priorities for the next decade, including an analysis of the current portfolio of investments in infrastructure and science. These priorities will factor in any decision to re-compete, renew, or terminate the CA.",NSF,4900,TEXAS A & M RESEARCH FOUNDATION,"400 Harvey Mitchell Parkway, S",College Station,US,College Station,TX17,Texas A&M Research Foundation,TX,778454321,47.050,['Mitchell J Malone'],07/18/2014,078592789,337123710,09/30/2019,4900,SODV - OPERATIONS & MAINTENANC,269599077,1326927,078592789,Bradford  Clement,1000 Discovery Dr,College Station,US,College Station,TX17,Texas A&M University,TX,778459547,clement@iodp.tamu.edu,Bradford,Clement,,9798454800,jallan@nsf.gov,James F.

303,"The objective of this project is to develop a data-driven smart monitoring methodology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD follows an accelerated degradation trajectory as compared to normal aging. Accurate monitoring and prognosis of the disease trajectory is critical for the success of many preventative interventions. Currently, no first-line screening system for monitoring the fast-growing preclinical population is available. While emerging personalized health screening systems provide the infrastructure to routinely screen massive numbers of individuals, it is an essential challenge to transform the role of these systems from passive information collection into smart monitoring to proactively characterize the underlying complex time-varying disease trajectory shaped by an individual's risk factors. This project aims at developing such a ""smart monitoring"" approach that will equip nowadays cyber infrastructure with powerful data-driven decision-making capabilities for better management of the preclinical individuals, leading to more efficient targeted screening and affordable care, better treatment planning and management, and improved quality of life for both patients and caregivers. Successful implementation will provide a substantial boost for the detection of the 4.5 million preclinical individuals anticipated in the next 20 years. Its generic nature will also impact monitoring of other progressive medical conditions, given the rapid adoption of personalized screening systems in other areas. The interdisciplinary nature of this research across data-driven monitoring, prognostics, optimization, and health care will prepare students a diversified education background. Broader impacts will be also generated through new curriculum modules, online software toolkits for implementation, and involving underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students in research experience programs.

The success of the project will significantly advance the state of the art in data-driven monitoring, prognostics, and selective sensing, and contribute to the science base of the emerging personalized screening systems. Specifically, to model and quantify the disease trajectory, a health index (HI) model will be constructed by synthesizing the degradation information from multiple biomarkers via the development of non-parametric and semi-parametric data fusion schemes. Then, to predict the personalized disease trajectory, personalized prognostics methodologies will be developed that can offline predict and online update the personalized HI model via the development of multi-level degradation models and Bayesian updating approaches. Capitalizing on the personalized prognostics methodologies, selective sensing methodologies will be developed to adaptively identify the screening tests that are most informative for the statistical estimation of the HI via a seamlessly integration of a novel Bayesian network model with robust optimization techniques.

Accurate monitoring and prognosis of the underlying degradation trajectory is critical for the success of many preventative interventions. Several biomarker measurements have been found useful for measuring the degradation trajectory; however, as these biomarker measurements are very expensive and can only be obtained and analyzed by skilled professionals, there is still a lack of first-line screening system for monitoring the preclinical population. While the emerging personalized health screening systems provide the infrastructure to routinely screen massive individuals, it is an essential challenge to transform the role of these systems from passive information collection into smart monitoring to proactively characterize the underlying complex time-varying degradation trajectory shaped by individual?s risk factors. This proposal aims to tackle this technical barrier by developing a data-driven smart monitoring methodology for the AD.

During the course of the project, many related methodologies have been successfully established. The methods can be mainly categorized into three groups: (i) data fusion models that can quantify the disease trajectory; (ii) Personalized prognostic methods that can characterize the subject-to-subject variability; and (iii) Smart decision making tools that can better estimate and control the disease trajectory. The research team conducted thorough literature survey on these topics and developed new methodologies to address the research gaps. The advantages of the newly developed methodologies were validated through both simulation and real world data. These results have been summarized in multiple publications in research journals, disseminated in research conferences, and embedded into several course modules. The research project pushes the boundaries of several disjoint disciplines including data-driven monitoring, prognostics, optimization, and health care, and develops a new body of knowledge and theory based on the integrated field.

The project has provided opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students to conduct cutting-edge research, acquire first-hand knowledge in dealing with real-world applications, and participate in writing technical papers for publication. The interdisciplinary nature of this research across data-driven monitoring, prognostics, optimization, and health care prepared students a diversified education background. International collaborative research and education efforts have been also pursued throughout the project. In addition, the PI has been striving to feed the developed research back to education by inspiring the interest of K-12 students in STEM field via a variety of outreach activities.

The Office of Cyberinfrastructure, Division of Materials Research, and Chemistry Division contribute funds to this award made on a proposal to the Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation solicitation. This award supports development of new theory and tools to enable rapid and efficient calculation of atomic level material properties.  The incredible advances in computing power and tools of atomic scale simulation have now made it possible to predict critical properties for existing and new materials without experimental input.  However, present simulation approaches typically require researchers to perform many steps by hand, which is both slow and error prone compared to what a computer can do.  Through computer codes that automate the tasks in first principles modeling human bottlenecks can be removed and predictive capabilities of first principles simulation techniques can be accelerated by orders of magnitude.  Such a high-throughput computing approach will enable generation of critical materials data on an unprecedented scale and open new doors for material science.

The team will develop tools for the specific challenges of predicting point defect properties, atomic diffusion, and surface stability, with a focus on automating steps to enable computations on a massive scale.  The PIs will use state-of-the-art first principles quantum mechanical methods.   Best practices for treating the multiple issues of charged defect calculations, for example convergence with cell size and band gap errors, will be refined and automated for rapid execution.  Similarly, tools to identify diffusion pathways and determine their barriers will be streamlined to allow users to quickly identify transport properties of new systems.  New theoretical approaches to modeling charged surfaces will be developed to enable simulation of surfaces in more realistic environments.  This award will support prediction of properties that play a critical role in advancing a wide range of technologies, from improving semiconductors for next generation computers to better fuel cells for more efficient energy conversion.  Software tools and data produced by this effort will enable researchers to predict properties for thousands of materials with almost no human effort, accelerating the pace at which researchers can develop new materials technologies.

Software and data developed from this award will be shared with academic and industrial researchers through modules on the web, scientific journals and presentations at national and international conferences.  This award supports two workshops to educate researchers about the latest opportunities to use high-throughput computing of atomic scale properties for materials development.  Students will be trained to work at the critical interface of the computer and physical sciences, supporting a generation of scientists who use modern computers to their fullest potential to develop new understanding and technology.

Due to these institutions finishing the project at different times the present outcomes relate primarily to the work from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

Computational materials design is a transformative vision for the identification and optimization of new functional materials. First-principles calculations based on quantum mechanics enable new materials to be predicted, screened for desired properties, and downselected by functionality, largely in the absence of any new experimental data. This work has centered on developing new methods, tools and cyber infrastructure to accelerate first-principles materials design.

We develop two new methods enabling the scalable implementation of first-principles materials design. First, we identified a metric for rigorously evaluating the similarity of crystal structures, defining a notion of structural and compositional distance which may be used in classifying and data mining structurally-determined material properties. Second, we proposed an efficient method for identifying cationic migration geometries and energies, enabling the high-throughput evaluation of properties controlled by ionic migration.

We also developed new approaches to help researchers synthesize predicted materials. Specifically, we proposed that it is possible to predict the conditions under which a target structure may be synthesized by evaluating the instantaneous driving forces for phase formation. These driving forces may be evaluated through efficiently computable, quasi-thermodynamic models, within a chosen synthesis method. We developed one such model for evaluating the thermochemistry of aqueous mineral interfaces, accounting for the effects of solvation and ionic adsorption, as these interfaces play a crucial role in guiding the nucleation and growth of solids from solution. We used this approach to evaluate how the acidity of a growth medium affects structure selection in the crystallization of FeS2, which exists in the pyrite and marcasite forms and is the most abundant sulfide in the Earth?s crust. We demonstrated that the effect of pH in driving structure selection between the pyrite and marcasite polymorphs may be explained by pH-dependent adsorption onto the crystal surface, driving the nucleation and growth of the marcasite or pyrite forms of FeS2 in close agreement with experimental phenomenology. As a broader test of this vision, we evaluated the effect of off-stoichiometric intermediates in determining structure selection in MnO2 polymorphs, which is another abundant and technologically relevant mineral system.

This project helped support the development of the contribution framework MPContribs in the Materials Project, built for sharing materials data and web applications. This work has supported a joint effort between the LBNL and UW teams to develop a sustainable pipeline for the automatic processing, upload and dissemination of data to the Materials Project databases. Data from this project are now user-contributed datasets in the Materials Project accessible through the Materials Project REST API. As a result, this now provides a dissemination vehicle for project data and thus solves the problem of sustainability in hosting it online. More specifically, data from MIT and UW has been integrated into the Materials Project databases. Its entry portal can be found at https://materialsproject.org/mpcontribs and tailored landing pages have been deployed for the following datasets (see screenshots below).

 

Dilute Solute Diffusion: https://materialsproject.org/mpcontribs/dilute_solute_diffusion/

MnO2 Phases: https://materialsproject.org/mpcontribs/MnO2_phase_selection/

Perovskites Diffusion: https://materialsproject.org/mpcontribs/perovskites_diffusion/

 

The design of a targeted landing page for their dataset allows scientists to convey information to the community that goes beyond the display of a single contribution (see lower right screenshot). A dataset?s landing page re-aggregates data from contributions to multiple materials and summarizes them with additional graphs and/or tables. This provides an opportunity for scientists to ""shape"" the message of their dataset as they would or have in the accompanying journal publication. Users can interact with (all) the contributed data and conduct involved analyses through a Jupyter notebook on MP?s JupyterHub instance. Visual representation of contribution components are identical to the online version but can be embedded in the analysis workflow as part of the notebook.

306,"Increasingly, firms and organizations are creating structured challenges to spur innovation and address both economic and societal issues.   Open innovation virtual organizations are formed to respond to a ""challenge call"" describing the need, providing specifications for desired solutions and setting a deadline for submissions.  Usually, this challenge call is delivered on a public forum with an invitation to those with expertise to share their solutions and an incentive for the best solution.   In addition, a cyberinfrastructure is established to support the development and delivery of solutions.  Solution proposers often participate in an online discussion forum where a social infrastructure is established with norms governing forum behavior.   At the end of the challenge, an award is announced to the best solution provider.

The incentives provided in most challenges inhibit knowledge sharing among contributors and collaboration is rare. Consequently, there is limited potential to involve diverse and unexpected innovation sources in solution development.  This project will develop a sociotechnical cyber infrastructure that manages the tensions inherent in open innovation virtual organizations to encourage collaboration among open innovation participants while mobilizing the energy and focus created by the competition of the open innovation challenge.  Through a series of open innovation natural experiments we will compare various interventions aimed at informing participants about collaborative ways to contribute and identify effective techniques.

Challenge calls can be an effective innovation technique applying science and engineering to important societal issues.  These new platforms are being used to find solutions for such diverse problems as developing an economical low energy use lightbulb, focused drug discovery, and reducing barriers facing returning veterans in higher education.  However, the methods currently used in challenges discourage the kind of collaboration that would be needed to leverage diverse ideas and generate greater innovation.  This project will develop methods to encourage collaboration among challenge participants and help public and private sector organizations find new and creative solutions to complex problems.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL,104 AIRPORT DR STE 2200,CHAPEL HILL,US,Chapel Hill,NC04,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,NC,275991350,47.070,,08/07/2012,608195277,91356,07/31/2015,4900,VIRTUAL ORGANIZATIONS,91356,1219829,142363428,Arvind  Malhotra,,,US,Chapel Hill,NC04,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,NC,275991350,Malhotra@unc.edu,Arvind,Malhotra,,9199663411,rramnath@nsf.gov,Rajiv Ramnath,7032924776,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Innovations in the application of science and engineering to business and societal issues are increasingly being conducted with the use of open innovation virtual organizations (OIVO).  In an OIVO, a business or non-profit organization identifies a need for innovation by broadcasting a ""challenge call"" to individuals outside the organization. Such a ""crowdsourcing"" call describes the need and specifications for the generation of innovative solutions.  This challenge call is delivered (posted on) via public forum to invite those with expertise to share their solutions. The challenge call is accompanied with an incentive for delivering a solution that comes closest to the specifications provided. The organization that sponsors the call provides a cyberinfrastructure through which solution proposers can participate in an electronic discussion forum. The cyberinfrastructure has an embedded  social infrastructure that defines norms for participation. At the completion of the challenge timeframe (usually weeks), an award is announced to a solution provider based on pre-established and broadcast criteria. Current research on OIVOs (especially open innovation challenge formats) has found that most participants rarely collaborate with each other on the cyberinfrastructure because the incentives and technological systems are not designed to encourage knowledge sharing.  The lack of collaborative knowledge sharing generally limits innovation.  For OIVOs, then, the innovation potential that exists with the involvement and interaction of the diverse and unexpected sources from the crowd are underutilized. 

The goal of our research is to develop a sociotechnical cyberinfrastructure for crowdsourcing for innovation. Such an ideal sociotechnical cyberinfrastructure is able to utilize the energy and focus of the crowd created by the competition of the open innovation challenge  while encouraging collaboration among participants in the crowd. We are developing the sociotechnical cyberinfrastructure based on our recently published theorizing about how to manage the tensions inherent in open innovation virtual organizations. Our theorizing suggests the importance of encouraging emergent roles, knowledge-sharing and protection rules, and learning-oriented interaction within these OIVOs.  As such, the empirical testing and refinement of current theorizing on the design and management of OIVOs will demonstrate the intellectual merit of our research. Simultaneously, our practical merit will be demonstrated by offering specific guidance to organizations for developing sociotechnical  cyberinfrastructures to generate innovation that have been empirically tested using real-world OIVOs. 

Significant Results:

1) Innovative solutions are likely to emerge from a crowd WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL INCENTIVES when the crowd is cued, through a sociotechnical cybrainfrastructure, first to share their knowledge about the challenge problem in short knowledge chunks, and then to integrate that knowledge into comprehensively inclusive innovative solutions.

2) A sequence analysis comparing the theory of innovation through idea variety underlying all crowdsourcing cyberinfrastructures today to a theory of innovation through paradox explication leads to the result that the paradox explication theory yields significantly more innovative ideas than the idea variety theory.  This result helps to explain why there is generally a wide spread disappointment with the use of crowdsourcing for innovation - because the theoretical basis for the cyberinfrastructures are wrong.

3) The use of internal crowdsourcing, if used simply to obtain suggestions from the crowd, is greatly underutilizing the ability of employees to co-create over a well-design cyberinfrastructure

307,"The Quality of Life Technology Enrichment (QuOTE) Project was awarded to The University of Pittsburg's Quality of Life Technology Engineering Research Center (QoLT ERC).  The NSF-funded QoLT is a unique partnership between Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh whose mission is to transform lives in a large and growing segment of the population: people with reduced functional capabilities due to aging or disability. The PI and her team will focus their efforts on building a model to transition students with disabilities across two critical academic junctures in post-secondary STEM education. They will create and evaluate a model that involves the cyber infrastructure development and that can be easily replicated and adapted by other post-secondary institutions. The specific objectives of the project are:
1. Create a university-wide data collection system on students with disabilities;
2. Develop an infrastructure to support an online learning community for faculty and students with disabilities in STEM fields (the ConnectAbility portal);
3. Pilot and evaluate the model and the components of the model. 
The ConnectAbility portal will include web-based faculty and mentor training modules; a two-course series, one for Freshmen and one for Junior and Senior students related to transition issues; and an e-mentoring program that uses the two-course series to facilitate communication and interaction between mentors and mentees.  The ConnectAbility portal will be designed to allow easy replication and adaptation by other institutions and serve as a one-stop gateway for all program staff and participants. The project will ensure the accessibility of the portal and comply with current accessibility standards and guidelines (e.g., the WCAG 2.0 and the Section 508 standards).  
The evaluation plan for this project will use educational process and outcome measures that address program effectiveness in (1) gathering and analyzing data and (2) developing, piloting, and evaluating interventions.

Objective 1.1: We created a system to collect and analyze data on students with disabilities (SWD) at Pitt.  This involved constructing a new infrastructure to be able to determine the enrollment number, retention rate, and graduation rate, of SWD in the STEM disciplines at both the undergraduate and graduate levels at PITT. The process involved mining current institutional databases to collect additional student data (major, enrollment dates, transfer and/or graduation dates (where applicable) to add to the database that the Office of Disability Resources and Services (DRS) currently maintains. 

Objective 1.2: We identified the best practices and successful strategies from current RDE Alliance Programs on transitioning SWD in the STEM fields from 2-year to 4-year, 4-year to workforce, and 4-year to graduate school.  We surveyed the literature produced by previous STEM Alliance programs.  We also carried out research at PITT to identify the factors that facilitate and hinder the progression of SWD in the STEM fields across critical junctures including transitioning from 2 year to 4 year, from 4 year to workforce, and from 4-year to graduate school. An on-line survey was carried out for Students with Disabilities (SWD) at PITT in March/April 2013 to gain this information.  Furthermore, we also surveyed the literature surrounding this topic. 

In addition we surveyed current SWD and alumni from Pitt to identify specific success strategies used and barriers in the campus environment.  We connected with the Pitt Student Disability Advocacy group (SDA) to assist in drafting the on-line survey for SWD through a preliminary needs assessment and later review of the draft.

 Goal 2

Objective 2.1: The planned creation of an interactive online portal, the QuOTE Connect Ability portal, was swapped for Course Sites &amp; Panopto because they are open source portals/resources that all interested users can access. Furthermore, the video lectures and PowerPoints for the HRS 1700 CACPS course as well as the mentor training course will serve, as a knowledge base for promoting recommended practices in achieving equal opportunity &amp; universal design implementation for Pitt as well as other interested sources.

 Objective 2.2: We recruited mentors for the course and prepared training modules that include material developed by previous/current National Science Foundation (NSF) disability alliances.  The mentors accessed the training materials on the same LMS prior to their involvement in the course to become ""certified"". 

 Objective 2.3: We took the data from our literature reviews and the survey for SWD to develop our course syllabus.  Additionally, we intend to submit this evidence-based course development process as a conference abstract, to include literature and survey results and course syllabus. 

Objective 2.4, 2.5: As part of the HRS 1700 CACPS course students are paired with mentors to discuss and clarify concepts they have learned, by using a series of case-studies designed to promote problem solving and thinking out of the box.

Goal 3

Objective 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3: Prior to the launch of the course, a pilot study was conducted using undergraduate &amp; graduate Pitt students in June/July 2013 to test the feasibility and accessibility of the HRS 1700 CACPS course.

Objective 3.2: Having been granted approval by the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences (SHRS) at Pitt we offered a 1 credit course, HRS 1700 College Achievement and Career Preparation Seminar (CACPS).  For the class lectures each week, a guest lecturer is either invited in person, or through Skype. The talk by the guest speakers aims to provide the students with an opportunity to gain an insight into how the lecture topic applies into a real world scenario.

308,"As one of the most promising emerging concepts in Information Technology, outsourced computation (also known as cloud computing) is transforming our perception of how IT is consumed and managed, yielding improved cost efficiencies and delivering flexible, on-demand scalability. Cloud computing reduces IT resources and services to commodities acquired and paid-for on-demand through a fast-growing set of infrastructure, platform, and service providers.

Despite the relatively fast growth and increased adoption of clouds, our understanding of aspects related to their security, privacy, and economic value proposition -- and hence our ability to trust them -- is lacking.  This project addresses this challenge by (a) extending cloud service-level agreements to govern aspects such as integrity of outsourced services, information leakage control, and fair market pricing; (b) developing mechanisms that allow providers to guarantee and users to verify that such trust-enhancing service-level agreements are being followed; and (c) exposing trustworthiness guarantees and tradeoffs to cloud customers and system integrators in ways that are both practical and usable.

The research work pursued in this project is timely as it addresses the issues of cloud trustworthiness early enough to avoid having the conflicts among its various stakeholders develop unchecked -- as was the case with the Internet decades ago. Doing so has the potential of improving the utility and hardness of our cyber-infrastructure, with significant benefit to our economy and society. 

The project will ultimately lead to a better marketplace for computing resources, in which users are assured that the services they acquire satisfy their performance, security, and privacy expectations.",NSF,4900,TRUSTEES OF BOSTON UNIVERSITY,881 COMMONWEALTH AVE,BOSTON,US,Boston,MA07,Trustees of Boston University,MA,022151300,47.070,"['Leonid  Reyzin', 'Jonathan  Appavoo', 'Nikolaos  Triandopoulos']",09/07/2010,049435266,1499986,08/31/2016,4900,Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace,1499986,1012798,049435266,Azer  Bestavros,881 COMMONWEALTH AVE,BOSTON,US,Boston,MA07,Trustees of Boston University,MA,022151300,best@bu.edu,Azer,Bestavros,,6173538919,nanzhang@nsf.gov,Nan Zhang,7032928930,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Cloud computing is transforming how computing, storage, and networking resources are consumed and managed; yielding improved cost efficiencies; and delivering flexible, on-demand scalability. Despite the relatively fast growth and increased adoption of computing clouds, our understanding and control over their trustworthiness is lacking. Trustworthiness is a nebulous concept, often used to capture various considerations, spanning dimensions of performance, safety, reliability, scalability, predictability, security, and privacy, among others. This project focused on designing mechanisms that deliver desirable levels of trustworthiness along a subset of these dimensions as well as enable tradeoffs across these dimensions, with a particular emphasis on mechanisms that are practical and hence deployable.

Trustworthy cloud systems must run trustworthy software. Because building trustworthy software is a very difficult and expensive task, this project demonstrated how to reduce the amount of software that must be trusted in order to achieve security, while at the same time not requiring a wholesale adoption of a new operating system and attendant rewriting of all existing cloud software.

Cloud services must be able to handle increased resource demands of complex computations, particularly as the addition of mechanisms for trustworthiness necessarily increases performance demands. We showed new approaches (inspired by neural computation) for constructing large-scale systems that maintain a human-friendly programming interface while automatically and transparently improving performance as a function of the system's physical size. 

Cloud services can become more trustworthy by providing proofs for the integrity of outsourced data and correctness of outsourced computations, so that clients can verify that they are getting the promised service. We constructed both secure and efficient methods for such proofs, achieving greater efficiency for more cloud tasks, by combining specific approaches for single tasks with general approaches for arbitrary computation. We also constructed protocols that provide proof of integrity and correctness without revealing any unnecessary data, thus preserving secrecy for high-value information. Our protocols are being considered for integration into the Domain Name System that is currently used to determine where information should be sent on the Internet.

Trustworhty cloud services must protect personal user information. Storing information securely is a nearly impossible task, as frequent, highly publicized breaches of personal information demonstrate. The commonly used approach is to store personal information in the cloud and hope security breaches do not occur. Instead of this high-risk approach, anonymous credential systems, such as IBM's Identity Mixer, allow cloud providers to ensure the users are authorized to use their services without having to keep any private information. In this project, we improved anonymous credential systems by developing tools for revoking and reissuing user credentials when something goes wrong -- for example, if a user's secret key is compromised.

Finally, trustworthy cloud services must be offered at verifiably fair market values. To enable such a market, we investigated game-theoretic mechanisms for building and operating an Open Cloud Exchange marketplace (OCX) that allows a federation of cloud providers to set up and manage cloud resources (hardware, software, and data) in collocated facilities. For instance, we developed practical and scalable pricing mechanisms that take into consideration the multi-dimensional nature of the supply and demand of cloud resources, and which guarantee desirable market-clearing fairness and efficiency properties. We also developed workload aggregation and colocation techniques that allow cloud consumers and/or brokers to translate flexibilities in their workloads into an advantage by exploiting differential pricing over space and time. 

Our work on the Open Cloud Exchange was the basis for a public-private partnership, co-led by the PI, to create the Massachusetts Open Cloud (MOC), which is hosted at the Massachusetts Green HPC Center (a data-center co-owned and operated by the five major research institutions) and funded (so far) by more than $21M from industry and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The MOC has been operational since June 2016, attracting research computing users from a variety of application domains as well as corporate users from a variety of sectors.

Cloud computing reduces IT resources and services to commodities acquired and paid-for on-demand through a fast-growing set of infrastructure, platform, and service providers.

Despite the relatively fast growth and increased adoption of clouds, our understanding of aspects related to their security, privacy, and economic value proposition -- and hence our ability to trust them -- is lacking.  This project addresses this challenge by (a) extending cloud service-level agreements to govern aspects such as integrity of outsourced services, information leakage control, and fair market pricing; (b) developing mechanisms that allow providers to guarantee and users to verify that such trust-enhancing service-level agreements are being followed; and (c) exposing trustworthiness guarantees and tradeoffs to cloud customers and system integrators in ways that are both practical and usable.

The research work pursued in this project is timely as it addresses the issues of cloud trustworthiness early enough to avoid having the conflicts among its various stakeholders develop unchecked -- as was the case with the Internet decades ago. Doing so has the potential of improving the utility and hardness of our cyber-infrastructure, with significant benefit to our economy and society.

Despite the relatively fast growth and increased adoption of clouds, our understanding of aspects related to their security, privacy, and economic value proposition &ndash; and hence our ability to trust them &ndash; is lacking. This collaborative project involving Boston University,  Brown University, and the University of California, Irvine has addressed this challenge by (a) extending cloud service-level agreements to govern aspects such as integrity of outsourced services, information leakage control, and fair market pricing; (b) developing mechanisms that allow providers to guarantee and users to verify that such trust-enhancing service-level agreements are being followed; and (c) exposing trustworthiness guarantees and tradeoffs to cloud customers and system integrators in ways that are both practical and usable.

The main research results the Brown investigators are as follows:

Verifiable cloud computing. We have developed methods that allow a user of cloud services to verify the integrity and completeness of the computations performed by the cloud server while keeping a small amount of metadata in secure private storage. We have also developed a new family of error-correcting codes that can be used to protect cloud storage and client-server communication against data-corruption attacks.
Oblivious algorithms and storage in the cloud. To protect the privacy of outsourced computations, we have developed efficient data-oblivious algorithms where data-dependent operations are performed inside a small tamper-proof device. Combined with standard encryption techniques, these algorithms can be executed in a privacy-preserving manner on a cloud server.
Configurable datacenter networking. We have developed the concept of participatory networking, in which entities in a higher level of abstraction, such as virtual machines or end-user applications such as a MapReduce service, can participate in the configuration of the network in a dynamic way. 
Resource management and protection in shared cloud systems. We have introduced resource isolation principles and a resource management framework called Retro, demonstrated in several components of the Hadoop stack. Retro monitors per-tenant resource usage, detects contended resources, throttles tenants responsible for slowdown and overload, and fairly distributes the remaining cluster capacity. 
Outsourcing cryptography to tamperable and leaky hosts. We have showed that it is impossible to realize a secure cryptographic functionality on a tamperable host or device with a personal identification number (PIN) where a user is allowed to make up to a fixed number of incorrect consecutive attempts to enter her PIN, with no total limit on the total number of incorrect PIN attempts. We have also developed techniques for defending cryptographic computations against certain classes of hardware attacks.
Password-protected cloud storage. We have given practical methods for password-protected cloud storage in the presence of malicious servers. Our methods rely on several different hosts in such a way that no minority of hosts store or receives any data that allows it to perform an off-line attack. These hosts could be the user's own devices, services in the cloud, or a mix of these.  Thus only on-line dictionary attacks are possible, the effectiveness of which can be limited by slowing down or refusing access altogether after too many failed attempts.

310,"The University of Texas, El Paso proposes to extend the work of the Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI) in collaboration with their partners: California State University-Dominguez Hills, California State University-San Marcos, Dade College, Florida International University, New Mexico State University, Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, University of Houston Downtown, University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez, and the University of Texas Pan American. Together these Hispanic-Serving institutions will work to adapt proven strategies that have positive impact on (1) the number of Hispanic students who enter the workforce with computing degrees; (2) the retention and advancement of Hispanic students and faculty in computing, and (3) the development of sustainable, competitive education and research programs. To accomplish this, CAHSI has already implemented a number of programs, including Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) that creates an active learning experience for students and leadership experiences for undergraduates serving as peer leaders, the Affinity Research Group (ARG) model that emphasizes the deliberate and intentional development of technical, team and professional skills and knowledge required for research, and Mentor-Grad that engages undergraduates in experiences and activities that prepare them for graduate studies and the professoriate. CAHSI has a strong record of success: recent bachelor's graduation rates of Hispanics in computer science increased by nearly 25% within their member institution, while over the same time period, the national trend showed a 39% decline. This extension will add two new goals to its agenda (1) institute a sustainable infrastructure that supports CAHSI's continued impact and (2) become recognized as an organization that affects decision-making and cultural change at the local, regional, and national levels. To achieve these goals CAHSI will establish the cyber infrastructure to support collaborations and dissemination of CAHSI practices, establish collaborations beyond the Alliance with organizations and institutions sharing common goals, and promote multicultural awareness in administrators, faculty, and students.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT EL PASO,ADMIN BLDG RM 209,El Paso,US,El Paso,TX16,University of Texas at El Paso,TX,799680001,47.070,"['Malek  Adjouadi', 'Mohsen  Beheshti', 'Enrico  Pontelli', 'Ahmed M Mahdy']",08/29/2010,132051285,3499783,05/31/2018,4900,BROADENING PARTIC IN COMPUTING,3757533,1042341,042000273,Ann Q Gates,ADMIN BLDG RM 209,El Paso,US,El Paso,TX16,University of Texas at El Paso,TX,799680001,agates@utep.edu,Ann,Gates,Q,9157477689,jcuny@nsf.gov,Janice E. Cuny,7032928489,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI) was formed in 2006 to address the low representation of Hispanics in computing in both higher education and the workforce. The motivation to establish CAHSI lies in the rapid growth of the Hispanic population and the urgency to build a competitive computing workforce and maintain the nation?s prominence in technology. CAHSI?s efforts are focused on increasing the number of Hispanics who enter computing, graduate from baccalaureate programs, complete advanced degrees, and advance in their careers by implementing effective practices that address causes for underrepresentation.  

CAHSI's vision is: By 2030, Hispanics will represent 20% or more of those who earn credentials in computing, i.e., degrees and certifications that lead to gainful employment and advancement in the field. The founding institutions are: California State University, Dominguez Hills; Florida International University; New Mexico State University; Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi; University of Houston-Downtown; University of Puerto Rico, Mayag&uuml;ez; and The University of Texas at El Paso. CAHSI has expanded its alliance to over 40 HSIs and organizations across states with high concentrations of Hispanics. Other partnerships sharing CAHSI?s vision include some of the most impactful Hispanic organizations in the country, e.g., Excelencia in Education and Great Minds in STEM.  CAHSI has been nationally recognized for its evidence-based practices by the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics as a ""Bright Spot in Hispanic Education"" and has been added to the ""Growing What Works"" database by Excelencia in Education, a nonprofit organization dedicated to Hispanic student success in higher education.

Intellectual Merit. CAHSI integrates evidence-based practices and promotes educational cultures to support student trajectories through the academic computing pipeline by consistently fostering multifaceted Hispanic student engagement throughout undergraduate and graduate education. CAHSI has spent great effort and resources to develop organizational capacity for pedagogical change and to cultivate a robust network of partners with tangible, meaningful contributions to CAHSI resources. CAHSI?s educational innovations have increased student retention and success. Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL), for example, has increased course completion rates by 10%. Designated by the U.S. Department of Education as a promising and practical strategy to increase student success, PLTL introduces a peer-led workshop as an integral part of the course. CAHSI students are socialized into the knowledge, skills, and values of the profession from research experiences using the Affinity Research Group (ARG) model, a set of practices built on cooperative-learning principles that have been shown to increase student achievement and self-esteem. From 2009-2014, ARG students have attended professional conferences at thrice the rate of a large, diverse national sample of REU students, and presented a paper or poster at a national conference at thrice the national rate. These differences are statistically significant. The evaluation of CAHSI?s organizational capacity at the institutional level found that CAHSI faculty report students are more engaged in computing since CAHSI began, with 79% of these faculty members indicating a positive change in at least one of the following: undergraduate research, peer collaboration, and/or faculty interaction; all CAHSI computing departments are capable of training faculty and students in CAHSI initiatives; and all departments have more than one trained faculty member on campus. CAHSI departments are moving towards financial sustainability with two initiatives fully-funded through alternative resources, including institutional monetary support.

Recent highlights are the creation of a new computer science associate degree program at NMSU-Alamogordo and Dona Ana Community College, which are aligned to programs at NMSU; funding to provide consultation to Google on student development and programming for HSIs; development and refinement of the cybersecurity sessions at the Hispanic Engineering National Achievement Awards Conference (HENAAC); and development of co-curricular cybersecurity workshops with the Army Research Laboratory for adoption at CAHSI institutions.   A collaboration with UTEP, NMSU, CSU-DH, and Google resulted in the creation and dissemination of three one- to two-credit problem solving courses. The intent is to provide deliberate development of problem solving techniques and skills that prepare students for competitive white-boarding interviews.  

Broader Impacts. The CAHSI networked community provides an inclusive educational and research environment for Hispanic students to thrive in pursuit of their education and to succeed as a well-trained workforce with advanced degrees in STEM disciplines. The network has contributed to complementary K-12 efforts and serves as a model for advancing students in higher education, including those from other underrepresented groups. CAHSI?s signature practices have extended organizational capacity-building efforts to a wider range of contexts. The expansion to two-year colleges has expanded CAHSI?s collective impact.  

In order to grow as a national alliance while at the same time maintaining quality services and staying laser focused on a shared vision, CAHSI?s next steps are to expand its infrastructure; create ""on-the-ground"" connectors and conveners to keep members engaged; focus on reinforcing activities that address local, regional, and cultural needs; and foster a culture of results-based accountability

311,"U-Pb laser ablation geochronology has become the most commonly applied tool for dating zircons. Despite the widespread application of this tool to a host of geological problems, there is little consensus with regard to analytical strategies and data reduction protocols. The result is inter-laboratory bias and both under- and over-estimation of errors on calculated dates. This limits our ability to compare results from different labs and limits rigorous compilations from databases such as EarthChem. This project will remedy this situation by developing cyber infrastructure tools in support of Laser-Ablation ICP-Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The project will develop open-source, free, software in consultation with the international community to treat with statistical rigor all aspects of data reduction, from calculation of ratios to correction for interferences and drift. Our approach will follow that used in developing similar software as part of the EARTHTIME project and requires the integration of the fields of software engineering and geochemistry. The resulting software will eliminate large sources of interlaboratory bias and serve as a teaching tool showing clearly how raw ratios are converted into dates and uncertainties.

Creating the software for connecting the LA-ICP-MS community with the developing EarthChem database for geochronology and thermochronology will provide the integration of data from this important technique into the larger data structure of geochemistry and geology. These data will play an important role in far-ranging fields such as understanding the growth of continents, chronology of evolutionary changes, timing of early hominid evolution, and linkages between climate and tectonics. During all phases of the planned work, we will involve a broad cross section of the community from undergraduates to post-doctoral scientists to help develop the next generation of analysts and software engineers. In particular, the systematic evolution of the collaboration between software engineers and earth scientists will be advanced as it produces robust and reliable workflow tools.",NSF,4900,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,77 MASSACHUSETTS AVE,Cambridge,US,Cambridge,MA07,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,MA,021394301,47.050,,05/24/2010,001425594,197007,05/31/2015,4900,INSTRUMENTATION & FACILITIES,197007,0930166,001425594,Samuel A Bowring,77 MASSACHUSETTS AVE,Cambridge,US,Cambridge,MA07,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,MA,021394301,sbowring@mit.edu,Samuel,Bowring,A,6172533775,dlambert@nsf.gov,David Lambert,7032928558,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The technique of U-Pb in situ analysis by laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) has become the most commonly applied tool for dating zircon and other uranium-bearing accessory minerals, with large volumes (tens of thousands) of analyses produced each year. Despite the widespread application to a host of geological problems there has been little consensus with respect to analytical strategies and data reduction protocols. The resulting inter-laboratory bias, along with under- or over- estimation of uncertainties in calculated U-Pb dates, hampers our ability to reliably integrate results from different labs/instruments and limits meaningful data compilations from databases such as EarthChem.

This collaborative research project was aimed at developing publically available, open-source software for statistically rigorous and transparent treatment of LA-ICPMS data, from processing of raw isotopic ratios and date calculation to publication and archiving of data in searchable databases. A major undertaking of this project was to design, engineer and test extensions to the software previously developed for U-Pb ID-TIMS geochronology under the NSF supported EARTHTIME project, in order to support end-to-end processing of voluminous LA-ICPMS data. The projectÆs flagship software system dubbed ET_Redux has been equipped with a host of tools and capabilities to accommodate a range of ICPMS instruments and data types. These include processing and visualization of integrated U-Pb and trace element data from split-stream ICPMS analyses, construction of Th-Pb and normalized REE diagrams, and the functionality of performing and plotting user-defined mathematical equations.

This project has fostered collaboration between the fields of software engineering and geochemistry at an advanced level with the goal of producing a robust and reliable workflow infrastructure for U-Pb LA-ICPMS geochronology. This infrastructure provides a seamless flow from analysis to publication and eventually archiving in the EarthChem database. Searchable access to archived geochronologic and thermochronologic data that are fully integrated in the larger data structure for geochemistry and geology enhances the quality and breadth of information available to researchers, students, teachers and the public. It equips researchers with powerful tools to address a host of scientific problems in far-ranging fields such as the rate of growth of continents, time scales of evolutionary changes, and linkages between climate and tectonics. The end-to-end workflow architecture implemented in ET_Redux serves as a template for future geochronologic data applications incorporating 40Ar/39Ar, uranium-series disequilibrium, U-Th-He, and a host of other isotopic systems, with the benefit of providing transparency and facilitating education.

312,"Broadcast media underlying wireless networks enable diverse devices to communicate using shared channels, but also leave them severely exposed to adversaries. Our increased reliance on wireless networks for connectivity to the cyber-infrastructure, and for monitoring our physical infrastructure, has opened the door for sophisticated denial-of-service attacks with potentially devastating effects on our economy and homeland security.

This project pursues a new game-theoretic framework for agile and resilient wireless systems. The framework models the interaction between communicating nodes and adversaries as two-player games, with strategies defined by various protocol choices and cross-layer attacks. A central thesis of this game-theoretic paradigm is that resilient wireless systems need to be highly agile, rapidly mixing strategies to thwart adaptive attackers.

The research methodology underlying this project is threefold. The first component formulates games capturing complex interactions between communicating nodes and adversaries across basic building blocks of wireless systems. The second component concerns optimization problems and equilibria associated with these games. The final component realizes the architecture and solutions in two
real-world prototypes: a Linux-based platform for 802.11 networks, and a Software-Defined Radio platform for studying more sophisticated mechanisms.

This project addresses the critical need of protecting our wireless infrastructure from DoS attacks.

313,"This five-year project funds the continued efforts by the hydrologic science community to develop infrastructure for the integrated study of the water cycle. Four major project areas are in informatics, instrumentation, synthesis, and observatory design. In informatics, the focus of the effort is moving a developmental effort in web services to provide seamless access to water data services to an operational status through outreach and engagement of the academic research community and collaboration with government agencies which collect water data, such as the US Geological Survey, US Environmental Protection Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the US Department of Agriculture. Workshops will also be held for the development of a Community Hydrologic Modeling Platform. Training workshops for advanced instrumentation will be held annually that will bring together academic developers, industry, and field scientists. Interdisciplinary research can be advanced through synthesis of data sets from multiple perspectives. Two summer synthesis institutes will be held to enable broader community participation in existing synthesis activities underway at the University of Illinois and City University of New York. CUAHSI will also participate in the on-going design of the WATERS Network, a major capital project for field observatories being developed jointly with the environmental engineering and social sciences communities.

Effective management of water resources in the coming century will require a more complete understanding of water in the earth system, its interactions with biota, and its economic role in food, fiber, and energy production, particularly as we are faced with climate change and increasing population pressures on this vital resource. This project seeks to develop tools and services to permit more integrated water research to be done more quickly and more efficiently.",NSF,4900,CONSORTIUM OF UNIVERSITIES FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF HYDROLOGIC SCIENCE INC,150 Cambridge Park Drive,Cambridge,US,Cambridge,MA07,Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sci,MA,021402479,47.050,"['Albert J Valocchi', 'Scott W Tyler', 'David W Hyndman']",02/05/2009,034255724,5245799,01/31/2016,4900,HYDROLOGIC SCIENCES,6160876,0753521,,Richard P Hooper,150 Cambridge Park Drive,Cambridge,US,Cambridge,MA07,Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sci,MA,021402479,richard.hooper@tufts.edu,Richard,Hooper,P,6176273211,ttorgers@nsf.gov,Thomas Torgersen,7032924738,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"This project funded the operations of CUAHSI, a university consortium that supports research in water by providing infrastructure support to all universities. CUAHSI is different from other NSF-supported consortia because water research is conducted by different academic disciplines in different departments, including earth sciences, engineering, ecology, and agricultural sciences. THus, CUAHSI has laid the foundations for performing water science research in a new way, enabling a multi-disciplinary approach.

CUAHSI services have focused on developing data publication and data sharing. This work has been done in colloaboration with US Federal agencies (because the data holdings of these agencies are important to academic researchers) and has enabled innovations in operational hydrology as well as academic research. In particular, the National Weather Service has developed the National Water Model (in collaboration with the National Center for Atmospheric Research--NCAR--another NSF-funded facility) to permit hydrologic forecasting at an unprecedented resolution of more than 2 million stream reaches across the continental US. See attached image.  The National Water Model also is an example of a community model that will be used as a benchmark on which to improve by academic scientists as well as used by government scientists for operational forecasting. This is a new mode of research for water science.

CUAHSI also has developed a web-based data client to access these data services, as shown in the primary image of this report. This interface allows scientists (and citizens) to access data holdings in an intuitive, map-based interface. This client has been used in various projects including the Shale Network Research Coordination Network in which citizen's groups shared data using CUAHSI services to explore the impacts of shale gas extraction in Pennsylvania and New York.

CUAHSI has also supported the academic research community through webinars, in-person training, travel grants, research meetings,and outreach events using documentary films to engender debate about water topics. 

This grant has helped to form a new academic community around water research and has helped to launch community-based research.

314,"The recent years have seen unprecedented deployments of high-speed transport networking technologies, particularly based on advanced, next-generation synchronous optical networks (SONET) and wavelength division multiplexing.  While related carrier provisioning methods for these specific technologies have been well-studied, the emergence of more expansive applications-grid computing, storage networking, virtual private networks-is driving the need for dynamic service provisioning across multiple network domains and granularity layers. This CAREER proposal focuses on research in the area of heterogeneous, high-performance, high-bandwidth, multi-domain networks comprising hundreds of nodes and fielding dynamic connection demands, refereed to as ""Bandwidth-on-Demand"" Services. The key efforts include scalable inter-domain routing, path selection and traffic grooming, service survivability, and high-performance network infrastructure expansion.  Overall, this project is expected to yield fundamental insights into the operation of large-scale, distributed, multi-domain, circuit-switched infrastructures.

315,"William Hase of  Texas Tech University is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop algorithms and computer programs for chemical dynamics simulations, and apply the software to study the microscopic atomic-level motions of complex molecular systems that have both fundamental and technological importance. The research goals are to develop accurate theoretical models for the simulations, to compare results with experimental measurements, to determine fundamental information about intramolecular dynamics, energy transfer, and chemical dynamics and kinetics, and to enhance the infrastructure for computational/theoretical chemistry. The specific systems that will be studied are (1) energy transfer and fragmentation of protonated peptide ions in surface-induced dissociation (SID), (2) soft-landing of peptide ions on hydrocarbon surfaces, an experimental approach for preparing microarrays, and (3) post-transition state dynamics of organic reactions and reactions in condensed phases.

316,"The recent years have seen unprecedented deployments of high-speed transport networking technologies, particularly based on advanced, next-generation synchronous optical networks (SONET) and wavelength division multiplexing.  While related carrier provisioning methods for these specific technologies have been well-studied, the emergence of more expansive applications-grid computing, storage networking, virtual private networks-is driving the need for dynamic service provisioning across multiple network domains and granularity layers. This CAREER proposal focuses on research in the area of heterogeneous, high-performance, high-bandwidth, multi-domain networks comprising hundreds of nodes and fielding dynamic connection demands, refereed to as ""Bandwidth-on-Demand"" Services. The key efforts include scalable inter-domain routing, path selection and traffic grooming, service survivability, and high-performance network infrastructure expansion.  Overall, this project is expected to yield fundamental insights into the operation of large-scale, distributed, multi-domain, circuit-switched infrastructures.  As such, it will help accelerating the development of robust next-generation cyber-infrastructure, thereby facilitating the emergence of a wide range of new services and applications.",NSF,4900,TENNESSEE TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY,Dixie Avenue,Cookeville,US,Cookeville,TN06,Tennessee Technological University,TN,385050001,47.070,,02/15/2005,878648153,,02/29/2008,4900,RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS,143994,0448225,878648153,Nasir  Ghani,Dixie Avenue,Cookeville,US,Cookeville,TN06,Tennessee Technological University,TN,385050001,nghani@usf.edu,Nasir,Ghani,,8139744772,dlfisher@nsf.gov,Darleen L.

317,"This project is collaboration between chemists, materials science researchers, computer scientists and geophysicists to advance the state-of-the-art in the numerical modeling of the properties of minerals, primarily at very high temperatures and pressures.  It will create a virtual community laboratory.  The intent is to refine existing first-principles computational mineral physics numerical simulation codes, to develop new first-principles codes, to develop novel visual human-computer interface tools, to make these widely available through a web portal and supporting grid infrastructure, and to use these numerical tools to investigate the structural, thermodynamic and thermoelastic properties of minerals in the deep Earth.  An additional component looks at some of the possible properties of ice on Titan, a moon of Saturn.  The project is motivated by a number of grand challenge problems in understanding Earth and planetary structures including: developing a better understanding of the variation in thermo-mechanical properties of silicate melts characteristic of magma; the behavior of hydrogen in near-anhydrous silicates; the properties of possible iron alloys in the outer core; and the properties of water-ice in environments such as those that may exist on Titan.  Other topics to be addressed include the properties of solid solutions involving magnesium, iron and aluminum silicates.  Part of the work involves developing improved parallelized methods for solving sparse linear algebra problems and three-dimensional fast Fourier transforms.  To facilitate collaboration, the project includes research on the development of a grid-based architecture for the submission, execution and analysis of numerical chemistry calculations.  The innovative aspect of this will be the development of a message-relaying framework to augment the communication and collaboration mechanisms currently available.  This will involve the augmentation of the NaradaBrokering system (NB) to provide support for plug-in web services through a WSRF-compliant API.  NB will also be extended to support the GSI security protocol.  Common access to resources will be provided through web portals.  Additional development will include the creation of collaborative (multi-user) visualization tools, supported by the NB infrastructure, specifically designed to be useful in browsing a snapshot of a complex simulation while that simulation is in progress.  IT work also includes the development of task automation and more sophisticated grid schedulers.  To test the collaborative environment, graduate students and post-docs at two non-partner institutions will be trained in the use of the community modeling system.  To facilitate use of the virtual laboratory and its tools, tutorial workshops will be held.  The project includes international partners from Italy and the UK, and international workshops on the numerical simulation issues are planned.",NSF,4900,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,200 OAK ST SE,Minneapolis,US,Minneapolis,MN05,University of Minnesota-Twin Cities,MN,554552070,47.050,"['Donald G Truhlar', 'Yousef  Saad', 'Joern Ilja  Siepmann', 'David A Yuen']",09/24/2004,555917996,,09/30/2010,4900,ITR FOR NATIONAL PRIORITIES,1809437,0428774,006220594,Renata M Wentzcovitch,200 OAK ST SE,Minneapolis,US,Minneapolis,MN05,University of Minnesota-Twin Cities,MN,554552070,wentz002@umn.edu,Renata,Wentzcovitch,M,6126256345,smeacham@nsf.gov,Stephen Meacham,7032928970,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,"['T.

318,"This project is collaboration between chemists, materials science researchers, computer scientists and geophysicists to advance the state-of-the-art in the numerical modeling of the properties of minerals, primarily at very high temperatures and pressures.  It will create a virtual community laboratory.  The intent is to refine existing first-principles computational mineral physics numerical simulation codes, to develop new first-principles codes, to develop novel visual human-computer interface tools, to make these widely available through a web portal and supporting grid infrastructure, and to use these numerical tools to investigate the structural, thermodynamic and thermoelastic properties of minerals in the deep Earth.  An additional component looks at some of the possible properties of ice on Titan, a moon of Saturn.  The project is motivated by a number of grand challenge problems in understanding Earth and planetary structures including: developing a better understanding of the variation in thermo-mechanical properties of silicate melts characteristic of magma; the behavior of hydrogen in near-anhydrous silicates; the properties of possible iron alloys in the outer core; and the properties of water-ice in environments such as those that may exist on Titan.  Other topics to be addressed include the properties of solid solutions involving magnesium, iron and aluminum silicates.  Part of the work involves developing improved parallelized methods for solving sparse linear algebra problems and three-dimensional fast Fourier transforms.  To facilitate collaboration, the project includes research on the development of a grid-based architecture for the submission, execution and analysis of numerical chemistry calculations.  The innovative aspect of this will be the development of a message-relaying framework to augment the communication and collaboration mechanisms currently available.  This will involve the augmentation of the NaradaBrokering system (NB) to provide support for plug-in web services through a WSRF-compliant API.  NB will also be extended to support the GSI security protocol.  Common access to resources will be provided through web portals.  Additional development will include the creation of collaborative (multi-user) visualization tools, supported by the NB infrastructure, specifically designed to be useful in browsing a snapshot of a complex simulation while that simulation is in progress.  IT work also includes the development of task automation and more sophisticated grid schedulers.

319,"The Spallation Neutron Source (the ""SNS""), under construction in Oak Ridge, Tennessee with a budget of $B1.411, is the world's largest science construction project. In 2006 it will start to produce intense beams of neutrons to be used as probes of materials. The instruments that control these beams, and detect the neutrons scattered from specimens, are state-of-the-art. Neutron scattering experiments performed at the SNS will produce data of unprecedented detail on the positions and motions of atoms and spins in materials, molecules, and condensed matter. Under the IMR-MIP program at the NSF, a conceptual engineering design effort is being supported to build software for the analysis of data from the SNS and other neutron facilities in a system called DANSE - distributed data analysis for neutron scattering experiments. The DANSE project includes a central resources activity, and subprojects in the different subfields of neutron scattering science at different institutions around the U.S. The lead institution is the California Institute of Technology. The scientific subprojects are led by faculty at Michigan State Univ. (diffraction), at Iowa State Univ. (engineering diffraction), the University of Maryland (reflectometry), the University of Tennessee (small-angle scattering), and Los Alamos, and Caltech.
DANSE uses a new software architecture based on the data flow paradigm. Analysis is performed with reusable software components that can be connected across a network using standardized data streams. Components are integrated into a coherent interpretive framework using the open source language Python so that custom analysis procedures can be constructed easily at runtime. The architecture enables high performance computing on distributed resources and opens access to the future cyber infrastructure of grid-based computing. DANSE provides an unprecedented opportunity to merge data analysis, theory, and simulation into a uniform computing environment. The goals of the DANSE project are to build a software system that 1) enables new and more sophisticated science to be performed with neutron scattering experiments, 2) makes the analysis of data easier for all scientists, and 3) provides a robust software infrastructure that can be maintained in the future.


The Spallation Neutron Source (the ""SNS""), under construction in Oak Ridge, Tennessee with a budget of $ 1,411,000,000, is the world's largest science construction project. In 2006 it will start to produce intense beams of neutrons to be used as probes of materials. The instruments that control these beams, and detect the neutrons scattered from the specimens under study, are state-of-the-art. Neutron scattering experiments performed at the SNS will produce data of unprecedented detail on the positions and motions of atoms in materials. The raw experimental data acquired with these instruments are not simple to interpret, and new software is required to transform the data into useful forms. Beyond such data reductions that are available today, there is an opportunity to interpret data using several major advances in computational materials science that have occurred over the past decade. Under the IMR-MIP program at the NSF, a conceptual engineering design effort is being supported to build a software system called DANSE - distributed data analysis for neutron scattering experiments. The DANSE project includes two parts. The first is a software engineering effort to build a framework that permits the interoperability of modular software components. The second is an effort by scientists

321,"Hampton University's Targeted Infusion Project entitled - Educational Partnership in Climate Change and Sustainability (EPiCCS) - seeks to enhance the continuing partnership among the Marine & Environmental Science Department at Hampton University, the Biology Department at Elizabeth City State University, and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, which is part of the College of William & Mary, by supporting integrated cross-institutional research and educational experiences centered on sustainability and the effects of global climate change. These three institutions have had a long history of successful synergistic collaborations that train underrepresented undergraduate students and provide conduits and trajectories to graduate training in the geosciences.

EPiCCS proposes to support the recruitment, development, and retention of talented students at two Historically Black Universities and Colleges (HBCUs) to participate in interdisciplinary training and education on sustainability and global climate change; to improve technology and cyber infrastructure at the two HBCUs to enrich experiential inquiry-based learning, support the development of new course offerings, and modernize current offerings; to emphasize curricular training that fuses practical applications and inquiry-based research experiences to provide new opportunities for hands-on learning; to promote collaborative cross-campus cyber and peer-learning; to build essential competencies in oral and written scientific communication in the next generation of geoscientists; and to guide students toward post-graduate STEM degrees via peer and faculty mentorship.

Rankins,7032928109,040106 NSF Education & Human Resource,"The Education Partnership in Climate Change and Sustainability (EPiCCS) provided research and educational experiences thematically centered on sustainability and the effects of global climate change. EPiCCS built upon a partnership among Hampton University (HU), Elizabeth City State University (ECSU), University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) and the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences.  This project aimed to attract and retain underrepresented students in the sciences, educate students in areas of climate change and sustainability, support new teaching technologies and guide students toward post-graduate STEM degrees.  

The grant supported the development and enhancement of courses at three HBCUs in the areas of sustainability and global climate change.  Specifically, at UMES, the new course materials in Climate Change and in the area of sustainability were incorporated into the General Environmental Science.  This course was taught during the Spring and Fall 2015 plus Spring 2016 semesters thereby exposing 50 students to Global Climate Change issues.  A new course on sustainability was introduced at UMES and taught as a one credit laboratory course.  The lab focused on renewable energy and sustainability topics.  During the course the students were exposed to how their life styles contributes to fossil fuel emissions, material on energy conservation, energy efficiency and passive designs. 

The EPiCCS project funded the purchase and installation of SmartBoard technology into the classrooms at the HBCUs thus improving classroom technology.  At UMES, it supported the renovation of a laboratory in Carver Hall into a classroom that better supported the use of Student Centered Learning techniques.  In addition, the classroom was used in support of online seminars. 

The EPiCCs project created research opportunities for undergraduate students.  Students were able to conduct research on topics from sea turtle strandings to habitat selection by juvenile blue crab.  These projects exposed students to the full range of science from hypotheses development, to data analyses and conclusions.  The project also helped to improve the science skills of the students through workshops on topics like how to develop a science presentations.  Students were able to present their research results and national meetings (e.g., Association of Science on Limnology and Oceanography).

Finally, this project successfully trained underrepresented undergraduates and provided paths towards graduate education. Students were able to transition from undergraduate school into graduate programs and one student has successfully completed their MS degree.

322,"The national and global research Cyber Infrastructure (CI) of the future is likely to exhibit a dichotomy in the physical distribution of cyber resources. At one extreme are traditional, large-scale data centers, such as the NSF supported supercomputing centers (e.g., NCSA, PSC, SDSC, NICS). The other extreme includes highly distributed federations of collaborating resources represented by tightly and loosely coupled federations for NSF projects including, but not limited to, GENI, XSEDE, FutureGrid and NSFCloud, which include university campus IT and campus research networks. In this second model, small collections of resources are owned and operated by a large number of participating sites. The most important contribution of the CI platform is not the sheer bulk of resources at any one facility, but rather the wide reach of the overall federation. These diffuse federations have a number of desirable characteristics: they benefit from natural geographies of researchers and data, and they require relatively modest resource contributions from each site, thus encouraging broad participation.

Building and maintaining highly diffuse federations of cyberinfrastructure involves distinct technical challenges that need to be discussed, analyzed and overcome.  This proposal funds a workshop that will bring together participants from the GENI, NSFCloud, FutureGrid and XSEDE communities to discuss, compare/contrast and understand the various communities' needs and approaches to control frameworks for CI.  The workshop will be held in the Washington, DC area on October 14th and 15th, 2014.   To help identify opportunities for collaboration, participants will be specifically encouraged to make statements of the form ""My project needs"" or ""My project can offer"" regarding the following topics: 1.

The purpose of the workshop was to bring together a diverse collection of community leaders in cyberinfrastructure (CI) to identify promising research avenues to advance the development and use of nationwide converged, shared, distributed research cyberinfrastructure (CI). The workshop organizers assembled 35 workshop participants through invitation and two general calls for participation. The workshop participants were made up of faculty, staff and researchers representing campuses, regional research and education networking  providers, ESnet, DOE Office of Science, Army Research Laboratory, NIST, US Ignite, NSF CC-NIE awardees, and the following NSF-sponsored centers and projects: GENI, NSFCloud, Globus, OSG, NCAR, and XSEDE.  The website for the workshop which contains the workshop description, the workshop presentations and the final report is located at http://nextgenci.eecs.utk.edu/.

A selection of eight workshop participants presented and explored areas of commonality and differences in community requirements, practice, and technology for CI from their perspective. A link to the presentations is located on the workshop website. The presentations specifically identified areas where cross-community collaboration and CI federation could have the promise to provide strong benefits to multiple communities. They also probed the gaps where new research is required to enable key desired capabilities. Workshop participants, through discussion, explored areas of commonality and differences in community requirements, practice, and technology for CI. Discussions led to the identification of topics for further discussions in the following areas: authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) and security; federation and resource discovery and description; application layer; and use cases, usability and user requirements.  Workshop participants also explored a number of federation and interoperability use cases and identified several candidates for implementation. The overall results were characterized by cautious optimism that federation between represented communities can be bridged but it is by no means a certainty. The communities represented identified several specific areas of need where future research can produce clear benefits. They counseled against undiscriminating, homogenized federation of CI, preferring a selective approach of targeted research and coordinated CI enhancements.

The following areas were identified as strong candidates for further research:

Resource description and discovery: Existing frameworks employed for CI resource description are inconsistent across CI projects. They capture different resource attributes and operate at disparate levels of detail. More importantly, they lack an underlying information model that supports composition of resources across diverse CI and intelligent decision-making supported by sophisticated software tools.


Rich policy definition and enforcement: Current CI efforts too often rely on implicit policy assumptions and on enforcement logic that is deeply embedded in software implementations. Available technology supports adequate capability for CI providers to begin adoption of explicit, formal, and externalized statements of policy, which can be enforced by automated, auditable software guards. Ongoing research emphasizing declarative approaches to policy has the potential to accelerate development of systems that are more flexible, manageable, reliable, and verifiably correct. Coupled with common authentication and identity management protocols, these mechanisms may facilitate sharing and interoperation of CI across communities

324,"Across the globe, citizen science projects are becoming increasingly poised to address social and environmental challenges and answer broad scientific questions. Although rapidly increasing in number, these projects need easy-to-use software tools for data management, analysis, and visualization to be successful. This project transforms how citizen science projects unfold locally, regionally, and globally by creating software that supports the full spectrum of project activities. It empowers projects to ask and answer their own local questions while contributing data critical to larger-scale issues. These tools will allow projects to announce training events; track volunteers; create datasheets; enter, review, analyze, and visualize data; publish reports; discover resources; integrate data; and ensure that data are contributed to repositories (e.g., DataONE, NEON, GBIF, HydroShare, and EOL). Tools will be made available to citizen science projects and will be delivered as reusable software elements for use in existing websites; as website features on CitSci.org; and as Application Programming Interface (API) services and mobile applications.
 
The tools will expand the national reach, local appeal, computational abilities, visualization techniques, statistical analysis capabilities, and interoperability of the nations? cyber-infrastructure. Using participatory design and agile methods, the project will: (1) develop reusable software elements that citizen science organizations can embed into their own websites, (2) harden and expand the functionality and capabilities of CitSci.org through new website features, and (3) extend the APIs of CitSci.org and develop associated mobile applications to increase system and tool interoperability. The target user communities will include citizen science project coordinators.

The project supported the growth and implementation of 360+ citizen science projects worldwide that collectively generated over 640,388 scientific measurements of concern to local communities. The system supports citizen science projects studying the threatened American pika (a high alpine tundra species threatened by increased summer temperatures and decreased winter snowpack), water quality monitoring projects, maple syrup productivity monitoring projects, amphibian monitoring projects, plant phenology studies at nature centers, California tidal pool monitoring, bald eagle monitoring projects, invasive plant species mapping efforts, and many more. The citsci.org platform is fully customizable - it allows anyone, anywhere to begin to study anything they wish that is relevant to them and their communities.
The project generated over 10 peer reviewed papers studying various aspects of citizen science - exploring factors associated with successful citizen science projects by studying the very projects using the open source citsci.org software and related tools which were developed through this award. Examples include research showing that citizen science projects leveraging aspects of place increase the likelihood of the data collected by the volunteers participating to be used for science-based decision making. Other discoveries include the impacts of participatory modeling when brought into a citizen science framework and platform for improved collaborative conservation and novel ways for citizen science platforms to capture important metadata about citizen science projects, volunteers, and protocols.
The project developed Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to allow CitSci.org to develop a first-of-its-kind mobile app that syncs with CitSci.org, allowing users on both Android and iOS mobile devices to sync their datasheets and submit data from their smartphones to a cloud-based system. These apps represent many apps in one - they allow water quality volunteers to record stream pH, conductivity, and total dissolved solids, for example, while other members of a bat monitoring project record completely different variables about the bats they encounter. Thus - the app empowers anyone to record anything  - anything that project coordinators add to their data sheets automatically appears for their members on the apps.
Additionally, the project championed the development of a data exchange protocol for sharing project metadata between platforms like citsci.org and scistarter, for example. The project led to the integration of citsci.org and scistarter - when new projects are created on citsci.org the project leaders can opt-in and have their project listed on scistarter.com to improve volunteer recruitment and advertise their project. These platform integrations were made possible through the development of shared APIs.
The project also supported a masters student who has since graduated and obtained a job in the environmental consulting industry and is now leading new citizen science initiatives with stakeholders.
The project facilitated 12 monthly webinars in a series dubbed ""Feature Fridays"" in which the project team participated in co-development and co-design activities together with users and stakeholders. These participatory design webinars affored those attending the opportunity to co-create citsci.org with our team to ensure that the platform was designed to be most useful to them. These experiences provided research opportunities that contributed to the growing body of literature in participatory design for software engineering. These rich and user-driven discussions contributed to advancing our knowledge about the growing field of citizen science and contributed to the ideas behind the formation of the Citizen Science Association - an association now supporting a journal for the field to share best practices for practitioners.

From a software perspective, the project supported the growth and development of the citsci.org platform and its associated mobile apps - leading to a datasheet creator tool, a new project profile page, a new my profile page where users can see the projects they are members of, summary statistics related to the number of observations they have made, and photos they have contributed. They are also able to set user preferences where they can opt-in to share data with other platforms such as scistarter (or not), receive monthly newsletters (or not), and get automated email alerts when new observations are made to projects of which they are members. Other tools and features created include a project forum, dynamic real-time map, dynamic sortable listing of projects, dynamic sortable listing of measurements being made by citsci.org projects, a member gallery complete with leader board, and dynamic real time charts for making comparisons, visualizing trends at a given location, and assessing relationships between measured variables.

SoN is a ten-week program designed to engage interns in both a structured review of network technologies (topics change each week), and pair them with cyberinfrastructure practitioners (e.g., network engineers, cyber security officers, wireless engineers, etc.)  to collaborate and contribute to a real-world network-related project. Indiana University operates the most advanced research networks, such as Internet2, as well as a software defined network lab and the Research and Education Information Sharing and Analysis Center (REN-ISAC). The SoN program provides an opportunity for students to see and touch the cyberinfrastructure that supports these IU activities.

The goals of the program include:

engage and excit students in the type of activities in STEM fields related to cyberinfrastructure
provide a range of experiences representative of operating state-of-the-art network technologies at scale and in support of data intensive science
strengthen collaborative skills through group projects.


The students were engaged in a variety of projects ranging from improving a distributed file system used by researchers at IU to using OpenFlow to add new features to the campus network. They also were able to work side-by-side with IUÆs network engineers as they operate the Internet2 network, developed new tools for the REN-ISAC, and became wireless network investigators by sleuthing through their dorm network.

In addition to the lectures and collaborative projects, each student selected a research topic from which they would develop and present a poster during the last week of the program. Their poster session was attended by IU staff, as well as commercial sponsors of the SoN.

Since the program has concluded, three of the students have sought and received professional positions at IU in the STEM field of networking.

Another outcome of the program is SoNÆs further development into a more formal for-credit class within IUÆs School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC). This years SoN is a close collaboration between IUÆs technology support organization and its SoIC.

326,"Hampton University's Targeted Infusion Project entitled - Educational Partnership in Climate Change and Sustainability (EPiCCS) - seeks to enhance the continuing partnership among the Marine & Environmental Science Department at Hampton University, the Biology Department at Elizabeth City State University, and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, which is part of the College of William & Mary, by supporting integrated cross-institutional research and educational experiences centered on sustainability and the effects of global climate change. These three institutions have had a long history of successful synergistic collaborations that train underrepresented undergraduate students and provide conduits and trajectories to graduate training in the geosciences.

EPiCCS proposes to support the recruitment, development, and retention of talented students at two Historically Black Universities and Colleges (HBCUs) to participate in interdisciplinary training and education on sustainability and global climate change; to improve technology and cyber infrastructure at the two HBCUs to enrich experiential inquiry-based learning, support the development of new course offerings, and modernize current offerings; to emphasize curricular training that fuses practical applications and inquiry-based research experiences to provide new opportunities for hands-on learning; to promote collaborative cross-campus cyber and peer-learning; to build essential competencies in oral and written scientific communication in the next generation of geoscientists; and to guide students toward post-graduate STEM degrees via peer and faculty mentorship.

327,"Wireless acoustic communication is the typical physical-layer technology underwater
because of the high medium absorption of radio frequencies and of the scattering
problem affecting optical waves. As of today, however, acoustic communication
solutions support only delay-tolerant low-bandwidth monitoring applications.
Conversely, this research enables near-real-time acquisition and processing of
heterogeneous data from mobile and static ocean exploration platforms. Reaching this
goal will improve the efficiency of monitoring key dynamic oceanographic phenomena
such as phytoplankton growth and rate of photosynthesis, salinity and temperature
gradient, and concentration of pollutants. Toward this end, this research studies
underwater inter-vehicle communication solutions aimed at enhancing the capabilities of

The primary intellectual merit of this project offers the distinction between two forms of
position uncertainty. Typically, uncertainty in the position of a mobile vehicle as
estimated in relation to itself (which the PI refers to as internal uncertainty) is the focus
of distributed underwater robotics and networking. By contrast, the PI introduces the
new notion of external uncertainty, in which uncertainty in the position of a mobile
vehicle is estimated by others. Specifically, this project focuses on modeling external
uncertainty, on designing reliable underwater communication solutions that exploit the
external-uncertainty notion, and on demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
computation and communication resources on marine science and technology through
emulations and field experiments.
One of the broader impacts of this work is the generation of computer-literate
undergraduate and graduate researchers with a comprehensive knowledge in

Before the inception of this research project, however, acoustic communication solutions supported only delay-tolerant, low-bandwidth background monitoring applications. On the other hand, enabling near-real-time acquisition and processing of heterogeneous data from mobile and static ocean exploration platforms will improve the efficiency of monitoring key dynamic oceanographic phenomena such as phytoplankton growth and rate of photosynthesis, salinity and temperature gradient, and concentration of pollutants; also, reliable and high-speed data communications can enable military applications such as tactical surveillance and costal monitoring. Towards this end, this research project has studied and proposed new underwater inter-vehicle communication and coordination solutions among Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) aimed at enhancing the existing capabilities of the NSF?s Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) cyber-infrastructure.

Due to the inaccessibility of Global Positioning System (GPS) signal underwater, location estimates of a node (e.g., a propeller-less vehicle as a glider or a drifter, or an AUV) may be inaccurate. Inaccuracies in models for deriving position estimates, self-localization errors, and drifting due to ocean currents all cause position uncertainty when estimating an AUV?s location, which limits both communication and coordination capabilities underwater. In terms of intellectual merit, this research has offered the distinction between two forms of position uncertainty: internal and external uncertainties. In this project, a statistical model was proposed to estimate an AUV?s 3D position and its associated uncertainty. In order to optimize the inter-vehicle communications, a Quality of Service (QoS)-aware delay-tolerant geographical networking solution was proposed by exploiting the predictability of the trajectories of AUVs engaged in a mission as well as the directional radiation pattern of the acoustic transducers. Also, a reliable geocasting solution for AUVs with high position uncertainty was investigated in order to forward efficiently data packets to all the vehicles in a certain region of interest, and an under-ice localization solution was studied to minimize both localization uncertainty and communication overhead. Based on these novel underwater communication techniques, an efficient team-formation and -steering algorithms for underwater gliders were proposed in order to take measurements in space and time from the under-sampled vast ocean. The proposed solution enables glider swarming that is robust against ocean currents and acoustic channel impairments. These algorithms use real underwater acoustic modems and are combined with realistic underwater communication models. Additionally, novel bio-inspired underwater acoustic communication techniques were designed to improve the coordination performance of a team of AUVs. Communication protocols were also implemented on acoustic modems and tested in ocean experiments.

In order to achieve high-data rate underwater acoustic multimedia communications and support futuristic applications such as high-speed video transmission and deep-sea mining, a solution was proposed based on the idea of carrier aggregation in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). Via both computer simulations and underwater experiments, this carrier aggregation technique was shown to improve the total throughput of OFDM using an expanded bandwidth, where multiple carriers are aggregated for data transmission from one transmitter. Furthermore, robust and reliable data communication was guaranteed via a solution based on Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) that was specifically designed for underwater acoustic systems. Finally, in order to leverage the sparsity/low density of vehicles in the vast underwater environment and to combat the multiuser wireless interference, a new probabilistic Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) technique was proposed using confidence interval estimation, whose aim is to share the limited communication resources among multiple vehicles fairly and efficiently.

In terms of broader impacts, this research and educational project has provided multiple opportunities for training and for the professional development on understanding the basic concepts of underwater communications for many engineering students at the undergraduate and the graduate levels. Specifically, several generations of students during the course of this project were able to gain lab and research experience while working with the PI at the Cyber Physical Systems Laboratory at Rutgers University. This work has the potential to impact civilian/aquatic life as well as military applications by providing information in real time of the phenomenon being observed. Last, but not least, it is worth noting that the many innovative communication-engineering solutions proposed throughout this research project can be applied to different industries such as petroleum industry, deep-sea mining industry, environment monitoring, fish monitoring, and navigation.

329,"Ecosystems have changed more rapidly in the past 50 years than at any other time in human history. Lakes are exemplars of change, as a variety of social, landscape and climate factors drive globally pervasive degradation of lake water quality and quantity. National and international ecological networks play a valuable role in monitoring the world?s ecosystems through continuous automated sensing of key environmental variables. The Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) has been amassing data from lake-sensor networks around the world. In this project, GLEON scientists transform ecological sensor networks from data collectors to knowledge generators through integration of the people, data, and cyberinfrastructure of lake-sensor networks. Scientists use three-dimensional lake simulation and advanced signal processing algorithms to exploit information embedded in sensor network data, as well as data from non-traditional sources, such as Web sites that log observations of city and state employees who monitor the lakes. Automated coupling of diverse data sources with simulation models will provide near-real-time prediction of lake conditions. With new data and model integration, scientists will gain new understanding into socially relevant environmental issues, such as the development of harmful algal blooms and the roles lakes play in the global carbon cycle. 

The collaborative efforts of lake ecologists, computer scientists, and information technologists will yield transformations for the scientific disciplines and benefits for the broader community. The use of non-traditional data from the Internet will reveal new pathways for multi-discipline collaborations that study how ecosystems and societies interact. The rapidly expanding field of environmental sensor networks will benefit by use of the data-model integration techniques developed here. The insights into data-model coupling gained by computer scientists will be of benefit to other disciplines, such as the social sciences and biological epidemiology, in which diverse data sources and complex models are applied to complex problems. Finally, the novel and advanced techniques developed will enable the next generation of scientists to study lakes in ways not previously possible.

Gholz,7032927185,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The GLEON Cyber-enabled Discovery and Innovation (CDI) program, funded by the US National Science Foundation, uses computational thinking to advance lake network science. Computational thinking is viewed as tight coupling between advanced methodologies in computer science and ecology that melds rapidly expanding and diverse data sets with novel ecosystem analytical models. Embedding CDI technologies in the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON), an international grassroots network of lake scientists, not only delivers the power of cyber infrastructure to lake scientists but empowers them to guide the rapid evolution of those technologies toward their needs.

Intellectual merit: Important successes of the GLEON CDI fall loosely into the following five categories, and additional information can be found at the GLEON Web site.  (1) Data federation:  CDI has helped GLEON lake observatories stream data from sensor networks to their local repositories; enabled new kinds of ecological analyses through melding modeling skills with distributed computing CI (i.e., HTCondor); and created the network of people, including mutual understanding and trust relationships, necessary to bring data resources together for ecological analyses. (2) Analytical model development: GLEON CDI has helped create an open-source hydrodynamic-water quality model (i.e., numerical simulation) that conforms to æstandardizedÆ data input/output, as well as æstandardizedÆ communication between model components and has brought that simulation capacity to the broader ecological community. The simulation, called GLM AED2, is now in use by eight other funded research projects, including that of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection for its climate change research on NYC drinking water reservoirs.  (3) Cyberinfrastructure development: Through collaborations of the UW HTCondor project, GLEON CDI has improved how ecologists use distributed computing resources to run analytical models.  Where one computer might take days or weeks to run thousands of lake simulations, HTCondor can run those simulations in minutes to hours.  In addition to the use of HTCondor, software to connect GLM AED2 to HTCondor was developed to make it easier for ecologists to access these resources and ecologists were trained in the use of HTCondor. GLEON CDI also developed Web technologies for tracking scientific projects of all kinds within the lakes community.  These technologies give credit to participants, inform the general public and scientific communities of science progress, and track the use of scientific data and the products created with those resources. (4) Collaborations: Through the GLEON CDI, new collaborations have formed. Specifically, work between hydrologists and lake ecologists have begun to help improve understanding of how changes in landscapes alter the flow of water and nutrients to lakes and the subsequent effects on lake water quality. Many other productive collaborations have been formed among scientists, educators, and members of the general public for the purpose of understanding and communicating the effects of changing climate and land use on lakes and reservoirs. Finally, GLEON CDI has supported many workshops and symposia meant to inform and train the broader scientific community in the use of lake observatory data and analytical models used for interpreting those data. (5) Scientific products:  To date, GLEON CDI has been credited with more than 30 scientific publications, dozens of scientific posters and presentations meant to communicate scientific results to broader audiences, one major software release (GLM AED2), and the release of many smaller software utilities that help scientists use and interpret data from lake observatories (available at the GLEON GitHub software distribution site).

This project connects researchers from the Colleges of Engineering, Education and Arts & Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Lowell to high-school teachers and students in school districts of Lowell and Lawrence, MA.  The project theme, Vibes and Waves in Action, is focused on the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) of sound and electromagnetic vibrations and waves and their interaction with the environment. It anchors the research topics of GK-12 fellows and provides a context for relating core high school Physics and Mathematics curriculum to the research. The project goals are to: (i) connect graduate fellows in interdisciplinary research programs through activities that elicit common learning experiences while delivering science education in urban high schools; (ii) provide leadership training that emphasize mentorship, social impacts and diversity education; (iii) engage visionary teachers to help develop synergy between targeted high school curriculum content, Massachusetts state curriculum frameworks, and the fellows? research projects; and (iv) provide high school students experience in use of high technology equipment and cyber enabled platforms. An industry mentor network will be developed as a resource to the graduate fellows and the high school community.  Cyber-infrastructure will be utilized to maintain a dynamic online presence, afford virtual collaboration, and to connect University compute servers, databases and lab instruments to high school classrooms for web based experiments. The program activities will be integrated into Creating Waves: a graduate course available for training all graduate students in STEM programs. This project will enhance STEM teaching and learning in school districts with high level of underrepresented students in STEM disciplines and create sustainable programs linking local school districts, colleges and regional industry together to improve the scientific and technical literacy of Massachusetts?s workforce.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS,600 Suffolk Street,Lowell,US,Lowell,MA03,University of Massachusetts Lowell,MA,018543643,47.076,"['Charles  Thompson', 'Fred G Martin', 'Judith  Boccia', 'Xuejun  Lu Dr.']",04/13/2009,956072490,1889831,08/31/2016,4900,GRAD TEACHING FELLOWS IN K-12,2350875,0841392,079520631,Kavitha  Chandra,600 Suffolk Street,Lowell,US,Lowell,MA03,University of Massachusetts Lowell,MA,018543643,kavitha_chandra@uml.edu,Kavitha,Chandra,,9789343356,lregassa@nsf.gov,Laura Regassa,7032922343,040106 NSF Education & Human Resource,"The GK-12 Vibes and Waves in Action project was conducted at the University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML) in partnership with five public school districts in the cities of Brockton, Gardner, Haverhill, Lowell and Lawrence, Massachusetts.  The project goals were to: (i) enhance the technical communication, leadership and mentoring skills of graduate students engaged in research in the Colleges of Engineering and Science at UML; (ii) engage visionary high school teachers to develop a model for integrating the research of GK-12 fellows into the STEM high school curriculum; and (iii) provide high school students experiential learning opportunities focusing on the areas of Acoustics, Wireless Communication and Computational Modeling. 

 Twenty-six graduate students from the departments of Chemical, Biomedical, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering, Computer Science and Physics served as graduate fellows in the project.  This group included seventeen male and nine female students with half of the cohort earning doctoral degrees.  An additional ten graduate students assisted the fellows in their activities and participated in the training. The project engaged thirty-five high school teachers, with fifteen serving in the lead capacity. Each year of the project an average of five graduate fellows worked in five different high school classrooms engaging approximately one hundred and fifty students in each semester of their fellowship.  Nearly eighty percent of the high school students engaged in this project were from Hispanic/Latino, Vietnamese and Cambodian immigrant populations, typically underrepresented in the fields of engineering and computer science.  

The fellowships provided the participating graduate students an opportunity to examine and identify their strengths and weaknesses in both technical knowledge and communication abilities. To participate with eloquence in a high school classroom, gain the attention of young students and accomplish targeted learning goals from the teacher?s perspective was a challenging exercise.  For many of the fellows it took a good part of a year to gain the skills and the confidence in being able to deliver an insightful lesson that incorporated elements of their research and one that also complemented the curriculum objectives of the course being taught. Over eighty percent of the fellowship recipients chose to continue a second year of their fellowship, continuing to work with their original partner teachers. The most successful partnerships were those in which the teacher had a vested interest in learning and integrating novel approaches to presenting Physics, Mathematics and Computational concepts in their classrooms. In these partnerships, the graduate fellow and the teacher worked to establish a short and a long term plan early in the semester so that the proposed topics could be integrated in small modules periodically during the entire semester.  This provided students an environment in which they could explore the problem presented incrementally while establishing a working and mentoring relationship with the graduate fellow.  In many cases, the outcome at the end of the semester was a research poster that was co-authored by the graduate fellow and a group of high school students. This work was presented by the high school students at the UML research symposium held in April of each year.  For both the fellow and the high school students, participating in this venue and interacting with the research of other undergraduate and graduate students from all academic disciplines at the University was an enriching experience.  For most of the graduate fellows the project experience was one that began as a difficult exercise but ended with a greater understanding of their own research, its relevance, and an appreciation of the issues faced by public school districts in urban environments that are experiencing economic challenges. 

A core group of high school teachers participated in each year of the project, establishing a strong working relationship with the UML faculty and graduate students leading the effort.  For these teachers, a continued partnership with UML has been established through the research and educational programs led by the project leaders.  The teachers have expressed that the introduction of computing in their STEM classes has been a valuable contribution.  The project emphasized the development and integration of computational modeling skills in the traditional Physics and Mathematics curriculum. This was a new learning experience for the teachers and many participated in the computing workshops that were led by the project leaders and graduate fellows. In particular, teachers were introduced to MATLAB and R programming frameworks with emphasis on designing simulations of experiments that students conducted during their Physics laboratory and project design activities.  Another outcome that was beneficial to the teachers was the implementation of an on-line course and learning management system by the graduate fellows.  The edX platform at http://vibesandwaves.org now provides an opportunity for teachers to continue partnering with UML graduate students and faculty through the collaborative design of lesson modules for application in a blended learning environment in their classrooms.

331,"Security is of primary importance in many modern computer applications, like electronic payments, personalized news broadcasts, location aware electronic services, automatic sharing and exchange of personal information for social networking, etc. Cryptography provides many technical tools that can be used to achieve security and privacy goals, but at a substantial computational cost. Traditionally, this cost has been measured in terms of the number and size of messages exchanged during the cryptographic protocol execution. However, such traditional efficiency measures are not representative of performance as perceived by the final user: the main efficiency measure of interest to the end user is real time, i.e., the amount of clock time elapsed since the user issues a request, till the moment the request is served. This is especially true for applications that run over an heterogeneous network like the Internet, where latency and bandwidth can substantially vary both across the network and over time. This project investigates the design and analysis of cryptographic protocols in a real time model, with two main objectives: (1) designing cryptographic protocols that are efficient with respect to realistic time complexity measures, as perceived by the end user, and (2) exploiting time itself as a tool to achieve security goals. For example, local timing constraints (e.g., delays and time-outs) can be used to enforce restrictions on the order in which events take place in a global execution environment.  Time can also be used to introduce asymmetries between the capabilities of different parties similar to what is typically achieved using expensive public key cryptographic operations. Finally, the value associated to information usually varies with time: what is valuable confidential information today, may be publicly available tomorrow. This project will investigates all these different aspects of real time cryptographic protocol design, first focusing on zero-knowledge proof systems (a representative and very useful class of cryptographic protocols), and then, after appropriate models for timed cryptographic protocol execution have been developed, expanding our study to larger classes of applications.

Broader significance: Security is essential in many modern computer applications, and to ensure public confidence in the cyber infrastructure.  Cryptography has developed many tools that can be used to secure electronic transactions, but still many cryptographic protocols are seldom used in practice because they are too complex or computationally expensive.  This project investigates cryptographic protocols that make use of timed operations to achieve security goals at a reduced computational cost, and according to a metric directly related to efficiency as experienced by the end user. As such, the project will help making cryptography more usable and more used in practice.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",Office of Contract & Grant Admin,La Jolla,US,La Jolla,CA49,University of California-San Diego,CA,920930934,47.070,,08/25/2008,804355790,300000,09/30/2011,4900,CYBER TRUST,300000,0831536,071549000,Daniele  Micciancio,Office of Contract & Grant Admin,La Jolla,US,La Jolla,CA49,University of California-San Diego,CA,920930934,daniele@cs.ucsd.edu,Daniele,Micciancio,,8588222577,namla@nsf.gov,Nina Amla,7032928910,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,"['Mol, P;Yilek, S~Chosen-Ciphertext Security from Slightly Lossy Trapdoor Functions~13th International Conference on Practice and Theory in Public Key Cryptograhy~6056~2010~~296~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=190094678#000279498800018', 'Micciancio, D~Computational Soundness, Co-induction, and Encryption Cycles~29th Annual International Conference on Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques~6110~2010~~362~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=189899567#000279249500019', 'Micciancio, D;Voulgaris, P~A Deterministic Single Exponential Time Algorithm for Most Lattice Problems based on Voronoi Cell Computations~42nd ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing~ ~2010~~351~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=195201940#000286949900036', 'Yilek, S;Rescorla, E;Shacham, H;Enright, B;Savage, S~When Private Keys are Public: Results from the 2008 Debian OpenSSL Vulnerability~9th ACM SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Conference~ ~2009~~15~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=191564946#000281630800002', 'Yilek, S~Resettable Public-Key Encryption: How to Encrypt on a Virtual Machine~Cryptographers Track held at the RSA Conference (CT-RSA)~5985~2010~~41~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=190097558#000279492100004', 'Bellare, M;Hofheinz, D;Yilek, S~Possibility and Impossibility Results for Encryption and Commitment Secure under Selective Opening~28th Annual International Conference on Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques~5479~2009~~1~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=182079936#000267823000001', 'Bellare, M;Brakerski, Z;Naor, M;Ristenpart, T;Segev, G;Shacham, H;Yilek, S~Hedged Public-Key Encryption: How to Protect against Bad Randomness~15th International Conference on the Theory and Application of Cryptology and Information Security~5912~2009~~232~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=189050017#000278095700014']","['Micciancio, D~The RSA Group is Pseudo-Free~JOURNAL OF CRYPTOLOGY~23~2010~169~http://wok-ws.isiknowledge.com/WoS?recid=185907097#000273359500001~10.1007/s00145-009-9042-~0~ ~0~ ~21/11/2015 06:57:32.546000000', ""Micciancio, D~Technical Perspective A First Glimpse of Cryptography's Holy Grail~COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM~53~2010~96~http://wok-ws.isiknowledge.com/WoS?recid=187127130#000275162900029~10.1145/1666420.166644~0~ ~0~ ~21/11/2015 06:57:32.546000000""]",10/01/2008,CT-ISG:    Real Time Cryptography,Grant

Title:  		MRI/Dev.: Development of Instrumentation for Project Green Light
Project Proposed:
This project, developing an instrument called GreenLight, measures, monitors, and optimizes the energy consumption of large-scale scientific applications from many different areas. The work enables inter-disciplinary researchers to understand how to make ?green? (i.e., energy efficient) decision for IT computation and storage. Consequently, an experienced team might be able to make deep and quantitative explorations in advanced architecture, including alternative circuit fabrics such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), direct-graph execution machines, graphics processors, solid-state disks, and photonic networking. The enabled computing and systems research will yield new quantitative data to support engineering judgments on comparative ?computational work per watt? across full-scale applications running at-scale computing platforms, thus helping to re-define fundamentals of systems engineering for a transformative concept, that of green CyberInfrastructure (CI). Keeping in mind that the IT industry consumes as much energy (same carbon footprint) as the airline industry, this project enables five communities of application scientists, drawn from metagenomics, ocean observing, microscopy, bioinformatics, and the digital media, to understand how to measure and then minimize energy consumption, to make use of novel energy/cooling sources, and employ middleware that automates optimal choice of compute/power strategies. The research issues addressed include studying the dynamic migration of applications to virtual machines for power consumption reduction, studying the migrations of virtual machines to physical machines to achieve network locality, developing new power/thermal management policies (closed loop, using feedback from sensors), classifying scientific algorithms in the context of co-processing hardware such as GPUs and FPGAs, and developing algorithms for resource sharing/scheduling in heterogeneous platforms. The full-scale virtualized device, the GreenLight Instrument, will be developed to measure, monitor, and make publicly available (via service oriented architecture methodology), real-time sensor outputs, empowering researchers anywhere to study the energy cost of at-scale scientific computing. Hence, this work empowers domain application researchers to continue to exploit exponential improvements in silicon technology, and to compete globally. Although the IT industry has begun to develop strategies for ?greening? traditional data centers, the physical reality of modern campus CI currently involves a complex network of ad hoc and suboptimal energy environments in departmental facilities. The number of these facilities increases extremely fast creating campus-wide crisis of space, power, and cooling due to the value of computational and data intensive approaches to research. This project addresses these important issues offering the possibility to improve.

Broader Impacts: The project enables researchers to carry-out quantitative explorations into energy efficient CyberInfrastructure (CI) and to train the next generation of energy-aware scientists. It enlists graduate students from five disciplinary projects, involves minority serving institutions, and is likely to have direct impact on commercial components of the nation?s CI.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",Office of Contract & Grant Admin,La Jolla,US,La Jolla,CA49,University of California-San Diego,CA,920930621,47.070,"['Larry L Smarr', 'Amin M Vahdat', 'Philip M Papadopoulos', 'Ingolf H Krueger']",07/07/2008,804355790,2000000,06/30/2012,4900,MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION,2062500,0821155,071549000,Thomas A DeFanti,Office of Contract & Grant Admin,La Jolla,US,La Jolla,CA49,University of California-San Diego,CA,920930621,tdefanti@ucsd.edu,Thomas,DeFanti,A,8583443415,rrodrigu@nsf.gov,Rita V. Rodriguez,7032925188,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Development of Instrumentation for Project GreenLight &ndash; Project Outcome Report

Outcome: Project GreenLight built a fully instrumented modular data center enclosed in a SunMD (an 8Æx20Æ modular sea storage container outfitted with 8 racks for computers and communications equipment). The racks were filled with a variety of computing and environmental sensing systems and turned over to GreenLight investigators to support energy efficiency research. Environmental data for the container and the computers within, including thermal characterization and  power consumption, was collected 7/24 and made available to the researchers via a custom service oriented architecture application, GLIMPSE,  with an easy to use graphical web interface, running on laptops, desktop computers and iPadÆs. Also developed was a collection of visualization technologies, include 3D immersive CAVE and ""Virtual Room"" (VROOM) display walls used to display and share GreenLight energy data and allow for improved collaborations among groups of researchers.

Impact/benefits:  Project GreenLight energy efficiency research activities have resulted in proof-of-concept experiments deploying many different techniques for reducing the energy costs in data centers, servers and networking equipment. These approaches to improving energy efficiency in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) are being put into practice in next generation data centers. Areas of demonstrated improvement include:

Conservation of networking resources using virtualization supported by low latency power aware networking equipment and novel network management techniques
Use of virtual and augmented reality to improve understanding of data and  the feasibility of remote collaboration (and thus reduced need for travel)
Use of process migration, improved fan speed algorithms and processor control, and liquid cooling to more efficiently manage computation, thermal generation and dissipation
Use of coprocessors and alternative processing architectures, including FPGAs and GP GPUs, to reduce computational driven energy consumption
Use of renewable energy (through direct DC power) and automated virtual machine migration (to remote computers using renewable energy, including photovoltaic, fuel cell, hydro and wind power) to reduce the carbon footprint of ICT (in servers, network switches and data centers)
Application of service oriented architectures to energy and environmental related data collection, aggregation, management and display
Application of advanced visualization techniques to allow for access to and interaction with the modular data center and its resources, to include environmental and energy data


Virtual room (VROOM) technologies will enable next generation scalable distributed, high-resolution visualization resources for collaborative work in the sciences, engineering and the arts. Examples of distributed applications include: collaboration with multiple high-resolution data types; prototyping command and control environments; digital cinema post-production review and editing; tele-immersive 3D interactions; brainstorming/storyboarding, and other pedagogical activities.  The constructed VROOM facility also supports GreenLight research and education outreach through ongoing demonstrations and workshops.

A series of workshops were presented to minority-serving institutions in efforts to spread knowledge of Project GreenLight energy efficiency research activities and visualization technologies while they were under development. The workshops, in collaboration with the Minority Serving Institutions (MSI)&mdash;CyberInfrastructure (CI) Empowerment Coalition (MSI-CIEC),  were held yearly at UCSD and promoted the use of advanced cyber-infrastructure to support data analysis and distance collaboration, using high resolution display wall environments connected by high speed networks:

333,"With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi User program (CRIF:MU), the Department of Chemistry at the University of California-San Diego will acquire a cyber-enabled 500 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer with cyber-infrastructure capability. The spectrometer will be utilized in various research projects in areas such as organotransition metal chemistry, development of polycarbonate doping resins for ligand deposition on commercially available CDs, nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis, chiral metal-organic frameworks and metalloprotein inhibitors, natural products from marine sources, symmetry of hydrogen bonds, isotope effects on acidity, and fluorescent nucleoside analogues.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry and biochemistry.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",Office of Contract & Grant Admin,La Jolla,US,La Jolla,CA49,University of California-San Diego,CA,920930621,47.049,"[""Joseph M O'Connor""]",12/18/2007,804355790,602745,01/31/2013,4900,CHEMICAL INSTRUMENTATION,602745,0741968,071549000,Robert E Continetti,Office of Contract & Grant Admin,La Jolla,US,La Jolla,CA49,University of California-San Diego,CA,920930621,rcontinetti@ucsd.edu,Robert,Continetti,E,8585345559,cmurillo@nsf.gov,Carlos A.

Specification and verification challenges for security protocols in sensor networks
0627354
Panel:  P060979

Flaws in security protocols are subtle and hard to find. Finding flaws in the security protocols for sensor networks is even harder because they operate under fundamentally different system design assumptions such as event-driven vs. imperative or message passing, resource and bandwidth constraints, hostile deployment scenarios, trivial physical capturing due to the lack of temper resistance, group-oriented behavior, ad hoc and dynamic topologies, open-ended nature, etc. These assumptions lead to complex security protocols, which in turn makes them much harder to verify. Sensor networks are increasingly becoming an integral part of the nation's cyber infrastructure, making it vital to protect them against cryptographic errors in security protocols. There are several existing techniques for specifying and verifying cryptographic protocols; however, none accommodates all the system design assumptions mentioned above. This research is advancing the state of the art in specification and verification of cryptographic protocols for sensor networks.

Abstract:
Control flow tracking at the machine instruction level is blindfolded without a validity check in the current processor architecture. Whatever the program counter points to the instruction is fetched and executed. Whenever this blindfolded instruction sequencing is not properly addressed at a higher level by system and application software, it becomes a vulnerability that malicious software exploits. To mend this fundamental flaw, this project explores incorporating control flow validation into modern high-performance pipelined processors. A straightforward idea of control flow validation can be collecting possible target addresses per branch to check every branching instance. Modern microprocessors do this checking in some sense already at micro-architecture level in the form of branch prediction. Since illegitimate control transfer in program execution can be made only when the processor's program counter is ""forced"" to point to ""unseen"" addresses, control flow altering attacks cause branch mis-predictions in the processor micro-architecture; branch mis-prediction is one of the symptoms of misbehavior in program execution such as binary code tampering and virus infection. This project develops micro-architecture for incorporating control flow validation into the branch prediction unit of modern high-performance pipelined processors. A processor core with secure control flow creates a basis for designing and building more trusted devices and cyber infrastructure. This project will produce a practical hardware support for validating program control flow to provide protection from not-yet-known attacks and exploits, i.e. before the behavior patterns, attack signatures, or vulnerabilities they exploit are analyzed and captured.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS,809 S MARSHFIELD,Chicago,US,Chicago,IL07,University of Illinois at Chicago,IL,606124305,47.070,,08/25/2006,098987217,200000,08/31/2009,4900,CYBER TRUST,200000,0627341,041544081,Gyungho  Lee,809 S MARSHFIELD,Chicago,US,Chicago,IL07,University of Illinois at Chicago,IL,606124305,ghlee@ece.uic.edu,Gyungho,Lee,,3124139657,clandweh@nsf.gov,carl landwehr,7032920000,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,"['Park, YJ;Zhang, Z;Lee, G~An efficient hardware support for control data validation~18th IEEE International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors~ ~2007~~409~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=173362422#000255432100064', 'Shi, YX;Dempsey, S;Lee, GG~Architectural support for run-time validation of control flow transfer~24th International Conference on Computer Design~ ~2007~~506~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=170759469#000252361000080', 'Shi, Y;Lee, G~Augmenting branch predictor to secure program execution~37th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks~ ~2007~~10~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=176981998#000248519500002']",,09/01/2006,CT-ER: Augmenting Branch Prediction for Trusted Computing,Grant
336,"Anna Krylov and Wee Ling Wong of the University of Southern California, Joel Bowman of Emory University, and William Polik of Hope College are supported by the NSF Division of Chemistry, under the Cyberinfrastructure and Research Facilities Program.  This collaborative project establishes a center for computational studies of electronic structure and spectroscopy of open-shell and electronically excited species, which will (i) develop a model for efficient cyber-technology transfer from the developers of state-of-the-art theoretical methods and software to prospective users whose research will be enhanced by using novel computational tools; and (ii) serve as a testbed for larger scale computational centers by demonstrating how specific needs of a focused groups of users can be addressed.  To achieve these goals, training and state-of-the-art computational resources will be provided to diverse experimental groups whose research involves open-shell and electronically excited species, and tools will be developed to facilitate the interpretation of electronic structure calculations in terms of experimentally relevant observables and bonding paradigms.  Feedback from experimental groups will guide the center's developments.

This project will serve a diverse community of researchers and educators whose
advanced computational needs are not currently addressed by existing models of cyber infrastructure, such as general purpose lab workstations or large shared computer facilities.  With a focus on greater understanding of open-shell and electronically excited species, new theoretical methodologies will be developed and incorporated, as well as new ways of interpretating calculational results in terms of experimental observables.  Training will consist of introductory and advanced web courses delivered using novel distance-learning tools, tutorials, manuals, and case studies, as well as series of focused on-site and virtual workshops.  A streaming digital library of quantum chemistry concepts will be created and disseminated through the Web. The library can be used by teachers in preparation of courses at levels ranging from high school to graduate studies.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,University Park,Los Angeles,US,Los Angeles,CA37,University of Southern California,CA,900890001,47.049,"['Clifford V Johnson', 'Wee Ling  Wong']",08/01/2006,072933393,,08/31/2011,4900,CHEMICAL INSTRUMENTATION,2006200,0625419,072933393,Anna  Krylov,University Park,Los Angeles,US,Los Angeles,CA37,University of Southern California,CA,900890001,krylov@usc.edu,Anna,Krylov,,2137404929,egoldfie@nsf.gov,Evelyn M.

This award will be used to apply the design of low frequency radio astronomy technologies, developed at MIT under a previous NSF grant, to the construction of the Mileura Widefield Array-Low Frequency Demonstrator (MWA-LFD). The MWA-LFD is a collaboration of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA), the Australian University Consortium, the Australian Telescope National Facility (ATNF), and the Western Australia government. The MWA-LFD will be located at the Mileura radio quiet site in the Western Australian desert. This scientifically capable array, consisting of 500 phased-array antennas feeding sophisticated digital signal processing systems, will have high sensitivity, broad 80-300 MHz frequency coverage, very high spectral and temporal resolution, electronic pointing agility and multi-beaming capability. Most importantly, it will feature an inherently very wide ~30 degrees instantaneous field of view. This combination of properties allows the demonstration array to perform cutting-edge science experiments with much better sensitivity than any existing instrument. This science capability will be available two years after the start of funding, and the last two years of the program will focus on science investigations with the array.

The science goals of the MWA-LFD are in three main areas of investigation.  The highest priority is to detect and characterize redshifted neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) signals from the cosmological Epoch of Reionization. The array will be capable of measuring the power spectrum of fluctuations, as well as imaging structures created by Stromgren spheres around quasars at redshifts with z~6.5, providing the first view of the cosmic dark ages. and early structure formation in the Universe. Second, the wide field capabilities of the array will be exploited to perform a blind search for transient sources of radio emission which is 6 orders of magnitude more sensitive than any previous work in this frequency range. Third, the array will be used to probe the heliosphere with unprecedented precision using interplanetary scintillation (IPS) and Faraday rotation techniques. The Faraday rotation holds the unique promise of constraining the orientation of the magnetic field in coronal mass ejection (CME) events, which is essential for predicting the impact of solar storms on the earth. Several other scientific topics, such as pulsar studies, solar bursts, the local structure of the interstellar medium, and radio recombination lines, can also be effectively addressed with the array.

The MWA-LFD will demonstrate a broad range of technologies and techniques that are essential for the future feasibility and performance of full-scale wide field arrays that are currently in a conceptual stage of development. The MWA-LFD is relevant to cyber-infrastructure and cyber-science initiatives in the development of an astronomical telescope with no moving parts, all ""actions"" are handled electronically, and in the demonstration of new data handling techniques, involving massive, near real-time processing and preliminary analysis, followed by data compression. The application of the MWA-LFD to heliospheric measurements will make an important contribution to the National Space Weather Program, and thus will have valuable societal benefits. The project will be executed by multiple national and international partners, which offer opportunities for student exchange, and promotion of international scientific relations. The grant will train postdoctoral researchers and graduate students, and will engage undergraduate students and teachers in the project at no cost to the grant, through existing Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) and Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) programs at MIT and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA).  There will be extensive outreach activities to local area schools and communities.",NSF,4900,NORTHEAST RADIO OBSERVATORY CORPORATION,77 Massachusetts Ave,Cambridge,US,Cambridge,MA07,Northeast Radio Observatory Corp,MA,021394307,47.049,"['Jacqueline N Hewitt', 'Colin J Lonsdale', 'Lincoln J Greenhill']",06/23/2006,005279778,4898882,09/30/2011,4900,MID-SCALE INSTRUMENTATION,5890245,0457585,,Alan R Whitney,Route 40,Westford,US,,MA05,Haystack Observatory,MA,01886,awhitney@haystack.mit.edu,Alan,Whitney,R,7819815419,vpankoni@nsf.gov,Vernon Pankonin,7032924902,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The purpose of the Mileura Widefield Array (MWA) project was to develop and build a revolutionary new kind of telescope, operating at low radio frequencies (like those used for FM radio and TV broadcasting), to conduct a variety of astronomical and space weather investigations.  The instrument site is in outback western Australia, well away from population centers and the radio interference they generate.  The science goals include study of a very early stage in the evolution of the universe, known as the ""epoch of reionization"", when the first stars and galaxies were forming.  The telescope was also designed to be very sensitive to time-variable radio emission from astronomical objects, and to see many more of these types of objects than before by exploiting its ability to make high-resolution images of an extraordinarily wide field of view of the sky, updated every few seconds.  This field-of-view characteristic and rapid imaging capability also make the telescope very powerful as a means of surveying the sky quickly and with excellent sensitivity, enabling groundbreaking research on objects and phenomena both within our galaxy and beyond.  Finally, the telescope was designed to probe the origin and behavior of violent disturbances in the solar wind that give rise to ""space weather"" events.  These solar-generated storms in the near-earth environment are responsible for the auroras, as well as a wide range of impacts on human activities in space and on the ground.

The telescope is constructed as thousands of small, simple antennas, tied together electronically.  By spreading the antennas across a large area, about 3km across, it is possible to create a high-resolution ""radio camera"" through a technique known as interferometry.  This requires that the incoming radio signals be converted to digital form, and that the resulting streams of numbers be manipulated at very high speed using complex algorithms.  The data flows are massive, amounting to hundreds of gigabits per second, and the computing requirements are formidable.  For this reason, telescopes of this architecture have not been possible until very recently.  The MWA is largely a software telescope, and has no moving parts.  The traditional telescope function of steering and pointing is done electronically, which allows the instrument to be very agile, and to move its focus around the sky in fractions of a second.  The architecture also is optimized to provide the largest possible field of view in a single observation &minus; typically 1000 square degrees at a time, which is scientifically very powerful.

 Most of the effort funded by this award was in the detailed technical design of the telescope.  The project was a large international partnership, with major contributions from the US, Australia and India.  The US team was responsible for the design of the antennas and the radio signal path up to the point of being digitized.  The combination of the signals into a data stream that could be used as a ""radio camera"", namely the formation of interferometer products, was a US task.  The US team also developed the complex algorithms and software systems, known as the ""real time system"" or RTS, required to compensate for distortions of the signals from a wide variety of causes.  The overall design of the telescope was spearheaded by the US team, and contributions to the detailed design were made throughout the system.  Extensive data analysis from prototype systems was performed, and development of calibration and analysis techniques for the specific science goals, most notably the early universe studies, was done.  A number of early science results were obtained and reported in conferences and journals.

 Due to a diverse set of issues, both external and internal to the project, construction of the telescope was not completed before the end of the award period.

340,"Recent advances in astronomical facilities have opened new windows on the universe that extend observing capabilities beyond conventional telescopes. Joint observations that combine telescopes, neutrino detectors, and new gravitational wave detectors including the NSF-supported LIGO Observatory are revealing aspects of the universe that are presently a mystery. Just recently, signals from the collision of two extremely dense neutron stars - a merger known as GW170817 - were detected by both conventional telescopes and gravitational wave detectors.  The event was detected first in gravitational waves, two seconds later in gamma rays, after 10 hours in optical, ultraviolet, infrared, and much later in x-ray and radio waves.  From this single event, the world learned that some short-hard gamma ray bursts indicate neutron star mergers, that these mergers might be the origin of many elements in the periodic table such as gold and platinum, that gravity and light travel at the same speed, and that gravitational waves really could measure how fast the universe is expanding.  Despite what was learned, GW170817 left the world with many questions. What object was formed afterward? Was it another neutron star? Was it a black hole? Why was the gamma ray burst associated with GW170817 unlike anything else that had been observed? Answering these questions, and conducting these kinds of joint observations on a regular basis, requires significant computing and software infrastructure (cyberinfrastructure).

The project proposes to develop the cyberinfrastructure necessary to give earlier gravitational event alerts to other astronomical facilities than is currently possible, allowing researchers to collect as much data as possible about these new types of celestial events. This project will fortify the streaming data delivery of LIGO by producing sub-second data delivery to a streaming early warning search for neutron star mergers. Substantial automated monitoring and feedback will ensure the entire system operates without manual intervention. The project will capitalize upon existing NSF investments in cyber-infrastructure for real-time gravitational wave analysis and will significantly augment the data delivery and automation layer for detections which is presently a bottleneck and failure mode. Using gravitational waves to provide an early warning for robotic telescopes will significantly enhance the scientific utility of LIGO data and significantly facilitate multi-messenger astrophysics.  This proposal will promote the progress of science in two of the National Science Foundation's 10 Big Ideas: ""Harnessing the Data Revolution"" ""Windows on the Universe: The Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics"".

341,"Natural disasters affect our society in profound ways. Between 2000 and 2009, disasters killed 1 million people, affected an additional 2.5 million individuals and caused a loss of about $1 trillion (2010 World Disasters Report). Effective disaster response requires a near-real-time effort to match available resources to shifting demands on a number of fronts.  Experts today lack the means to provide emergency response agencies with validated strategies for disaster planning and response on a timely basis. Data-driven models and computer simulations for disaster preparedness and response can play a key role in predicting the evolution of disasters and effectively managing emergencies through a diverse set of intervention measures.  This project will establish an approach that includes (a) planning disaster response, (b) public information and warning, (c) critical transportation services, (d) mass population care services, and (e) public health and medical services. Effective use of this integrated modeling approach may lead to enhanced safety, quality of life and community resilience. The project also provides an excellent context for doctoral, masters, and undergraduate level research and students will be introduced to career pathways through their participation in research, publication, and partnership with public agencies and data-driven science and engineering researchers.


This project will enhance disaster response and community resilience through multi-faceted research to create a big data system to support data-driven simulations with the necessary volume, velocity, and variety and integrate and optimize the key aspects and decisions in disaster management. This includes (a) a novel computational infrastructure capable of executing multiple coupled simulations synergistically, under a unified probabilistic model, (b) addressing computational challenges that arise from the need to acquire, integrate, model, analyze, index, and search, in a scalable manner, large volumes of multi-variate, multi-layer, multi-resolution, and interconnected and inter-dependent spatio-temporal data that arise from disaster simulations and real-world observations, (c) a new high performance data processing system to support continuous observation of the numerical results for simulations from different domains with diverse resource demands and time constraints.

The reasons for this conclusion include the following workshop findings.

Past sustained funding for HPCD has led to tremendous advances in many fields and NSF cannot let that progress and momentum stop. 
The success and pervasiveness of NSFÆs HPCD investments created an environment in which access to such HPCD resources are now assumed by the entire research enterprise. 
There is compelling evidence that computational and data intensive computing is now implicitly intertwined with all areas of discovery and competitiveness. 
The demand for high performance computing and data science resources is growing and will continue to grow over the next decades to enable productive and timely science and research progress. 
NSF and other agencies have succeeded in increasing the use and demand for HPCD resources by expanding the impact of traditional communities and broadening the engagements with new communities.  Further, workforce and research development efforts have enabled more researchers to make efficient use of high performance resources.  
Scientific needs increasingly require high performance capability for both modeling and simulation and for data science and science, engineering and other types of research.  There is an increasing symbiotic relationship between high performance modeling and simulation and high performance experimental/observational data science.  Today, the most challenging experiments and instruments cannot fully understand their data without modeling and simulation guidance and verification.  Likewise, modeling and simulation projects have intimate engagements with experimental and observed data. 
The NSF National Cyber Infrastructure must include systems of the scale and capability that match the best systems the major national laboratories are deploying. 
NSF should evaluate and develop funding methods and/or programs for advanced HPCD that recognizes the need for coherence and continuity for suppliers, providers and consumers of these capabilities in order to enhance the productivity of the scientific and engineering research endeavors. 
There is a need for a variety of platforms and service models to be efficiently addressing the breadth and depth of the national open-science research endeavors. While diversity is important, there is a point where dropping below a minimum size/capability of deployed national resources is counter productive and inefficient for the national science communities, the funders and the stakeholders.   


10.  While there are, and will be, cases for ""cloud"" based resources for pursuing research, the workshop conclusion, which included commercial cloud architects, is that cloud computing methods are limited and cannot address the breadth nor the depth of the national open research portfolio.  Even if there was a sufficient business case for commercial cloud HPC providers, there was consensus that those services would be limited to applications that use, at best, no more than a few thousand to a few tens of thousands standard cores of computing for the foreseeable future. 

11.  Many frontier science applications fundamentally need much more scale &ndash; to the order 100,000Æs to 1,000,000Æs of cores &ndash; to make frontier and best of breed problem solutions feasible.  Additionally, these problems require systems with robust and performant interconnects, storage, I/O services, and large amounts of memory in balanced architecture.

The reasons for this conclusion include the following workshop findings.

Past sustained funding for HPCD has led to tremendous advances in many fields and NSF cannot let that progress and momentum stop. 
The success and pervasiveness of NSFÆs HPCD investments created an environment in which access to such HPCD resources are now assumed by the entire research enterprise. 
There is compelling evidence that computational and data intensive computing is now implicitly intertwined with all areas of discovery and competitiveness. 
The demand for high performance computing and data science resources is growing and will continue to grow over the next decades to enable productive and timely science and research progress. 
NSF and other agencies have succeeded in increasing the use and demand for HPCD resources by expanding the impact of traditional communities and broadening the engagements with new communities.  Further, workforce and research development efforts have enabled more researchers to make efficient use of high performance resources.  
Scientific needs increasingly require high performance capability for both modeling and simulation and for data science and science, engineering and other types of research.  There is an increasing symbiotic relationship between high performance modeling and simulation and high performance experimental/observational data science.  Today, the most challenging experiments and instruments cannot fully understand their data without modeling and simulation guidance and verification.  Likewise, modeling and simulation projects have intimate engagements with experimental and observed data. 
The NSF National Cyber Infrastructure must include systems of the scale and capability that match the best systems the major national laboratories are deploying. 
NSF should evaluate and develop funding methods and/or programs for advanced HPCD that recognizes the need for coherence and continuity for suppliers, providers and consumers of these capabilities in order to enhance the productivity of the scientific and engineering research endeavors. 
There is a need for a variety of platforms and service models to be efficiently addressing the breadth and depth of the national open-science research endeavors. While diversity is important, there is a point where dropping below a minimum size/capability of deployed national resources is counter productive and inefficient for the national science communities, the funders and the stakeholders. 
While there are, and will be, cases for ""cloud"" based resources for pursuing research, the workshop conclusion, which included commercial cloud architects, is that cloud computing methods are limited and cannot address the breadth nor the depth of the national open research portfolio.  Even if there was a sufficient business case for commercial cloud HPC providers, there was consensus that those services would be limited to applications that use, at best, no more than a few thousand to a few tens of thousands standard cores of computing for the foreseeable future. 
Many frontier science applications fundamentally need much more scale &ndash; to the order 100,000Æs to 1,000,000Æs of cores &ndash; to make frontier and best of breed problem solutions feasible.  Additionally, these problems require systems with robust and performant interconnects, storage, I/O services, and large amounts of memory in balanced architecture.

345,"The global cycling of organic matter and elements is driven to a great extent by microorganisms with the ability to exchange electrons with extracellular substrates. Such abilities can be harnessed for the bioremediation of toxic metals and for bioenergy applications. Fe(III) and Mn(III, IV) oxides are among the most environmentally relevant substrates that microorganisms use as electron acceptors or donors. Due to insoluble nature of these minerals, microorganisms must establish an extracellular electron transfer (EET) mechanism to access either the reducing or oxidizing power. EET also provides cells with a mechanism that prevents the permeation and reduction of toxic metals inside the cell. Therefore, EET mechanisms serve the double functions of supporting respiration and preventing the accumulation of the reduced water-insoluble products inside microbial cells. Despite its importance, EET mechanisms have been understudied in the past and deserve attention from scientists from diverse background.

In this proposal, funding is requested to promote US-China collaborative research on Microbial Extracellular Electron Transfer by organizing a joint workshop between US and China, which will be held in Beijing, China, in March 2015. The proposed workshop will focus on research programs that can make the best use of the strengths and opportunities in both US and China, such as unique resources, infrastructures and scientific expertise. The objectives of the workshop are to promote interdisciplinary research on Microbial Extracellular Electron Transfer and to create new opportunities for successful research collaborations between US and Chinese scientists by conducting joint research projects and sharing resources, databases and cyber-infrastructure. Extracellular electron transfer is an essential component in many sub-fields of Geobiology and Low Temperature Geochemistry, such as mineral-microbe interaction, biomineralization, and microbial geochemistry. The PIs will involve young scientists, post-doc researchers, and students in the workshop. A web site will be created to post the workshop announcement, faculty and student exchange opportunities, and workshop report.

Because of their solid nature, minerals cannot cross the microbial cell envelope and thus remain external to the microbial cells. To use minerals as electron sources and sinks, microorganisms must transfer electrons extracellularly. Microbial extracellular electron transfer with minerals as electron sources and sinks (MEETS) plays critical roles not only in global cycling of metal elements, such as iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn), but also in global carbon and nitrogen cycling. Microorganisms with an extracellular electron transfer capability have also been harnessed for the production of novel, biocompatible and biodegradable nano-materials, the bioremediation of environmental contaminants, bioenergy production and the prevention of metal corrosion. 

 

The US and China have ongoing research projects on MEETS, which are mainly funded by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NNSFC), respectively. Collaborative research between US and Chinese scientists could not only have a major impact on this field, but also benefit both countries. Hence, a workshop was convened March 23-25, 2015 at Peking University, Beijing, China, with a particular focus on US&ndash;China collaborative research on MEETS. This workshop was jointly sponsored by US NSF and NNSFC. More than fifty scientists from both countries, who had a broad spectrum of expertise in MEETS research, attended the workshop to review our current understanding of MEETS, identify the key science questions and hypotheses for MEETS research and recommend a path forward for promoting US&ndash;China collaborative research on MEETS. 

 

            Over the past decade, significant progress was made toward developing a mechanistic understanding of MEETS. The microbial cell envelope is a physical barrier for electron conductance. To overcome this barrier, microorganisms commonly form pathways, with a set of redox and structural proteins, which span the entire width of the microbial cell envelope. These pathways physically couple intracellular microbial metabolic activities with the extracellular redox transformation of minerals. Some microorganisms can extend the redox-active surface of the cell beyond the confines of the cell envelope by assembling conductive and extracellular appendages, collectively called microbial nanowires, that transfer electrons to minerals distal from the microbial cell surface and to other microbial cells of the same or different species. Similar to the microbial nanowires, conductive minerals in the environment facilitate intercellular and interspecies electron transfer. Mineral properties, such as redox potentials, the surface area and density of the active surface site, impact MEETS greatly. Recently, photoactivated minerals were found to promote the growth of non-photo&shy;synthetic bacteria with light and mixed-valence minerals were observed to serve as environmental batteries supporting microbial metabolism.

 

Despite the advances in our understanding of MEETS, key questions remain. These include:

 

(a)                           How are electrons transferred from extracellular minerals to the terminal electron acceptors inside microbial cells, and how is energy from these processes conserved?

(b)                          What are the molecular mechanisms used by microorganisms for long-distance electron transfer to microbial cells of the same and other species or to mineral surfaces?

(c)                           What are the molecular mechanisms by which microorganisms transfer electrons across the microbial outer membrane to exchange electrons with extracellular substrates?

(d)                          How prevalent are such emerging functions of minerals as photoactivated electron donation and electron storage supporting microbial metabolism in the environment?

346,"This award funds the PI for two-weeks to explore with three Alaska Native villages of the Yukon Flats School District a community based participatory research (CBPR) project that would assess rural Alaskan information access and the potential of Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) technology for use in Alaska Native communities where current internet connectivity is frequently poor. To the PI's knowledge DTN is not in use in Alaska, but has recently been successfully prototyped in the Lapland and Slovenia. Since Thompson served as the Librarian for Yukon Flat's Communities in the 1970's he has maintained an interest in improving rural Alaskan community access to information technologies. This project will enable Thompson to explore contemporary rural information access issues through discussions with rural residents in Yukon Flats villages; with the intent of creating a CBPR research project that will explore the digital divide in Interior Alaskan communities collaboratively. 

Information access has become widespread through the growth of the Internet, the World Wide Web, and mass products such as Web search engines and social media products such as Facebook.  Such products  are not designed to support information access optimally for different cultures, such as those of rural Alaska. The DTN itself is a protocol that promises to make communication technically easier in sparsely inhabited rural areas. When information access systems that are designed in a community-based participatory way, such systems not only facilitate rural information access but also hold promise to improve health care and other critical infrastructures, which all depend on the Internet.

347,"The objective of this project is to develop a data-driven smart monitoring methodology of Alzheimer?s disease (AD). AD follows an accelerated degradation trajectory as compared to normal aging. Accurate monitoring and prognosis of the disease trajectory is critical for the success of many preventative interventions. Currently, no first-line screening system for monitoring the fast-growing preclinical population is available. While emerging personalized health screening systems provide the infrastructure to routinely screen massive numbers of individuals, it is an essential challenge to transform the role of these systems from passive information collection into smart monitoring to proactively characterize the underlying complex time-varying disease trajectory shaped by an individual?s risk factors. This project aims at developing such a ?smart monitoring? approach that will equip nowadays cyber infrastructure with powerful data-driven decision-making capabilities for better management of the preclinical individuals, leading to more efficient targeted screening and affordable care, better treatment planning and management, and improved quality of life for both patients and caregivers. Successful implementation will provide a substantial boost for the detection of the 4.5 million preclinical individuals anticipated in the next 20 years. Its generic nature will also impact monitoring of other progressive medical conditions, given the rapid adoption of personalized screening systems in other areas. The interdisciplinary nature of this research across data-driven monitoring, prognostics, optimization, and health care will prepare students a diversified education background. Broader impacts will be also generated through new curriculum modules, online software toolkits for implementation, and involving underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students in research experience programs.

The success of the project will significantly advance the state of the art in data-driven monitoring, prognostics, and selective sensing, and contribute to the science base of the emerging personalized screening systems. Specifically, to model and quantify the disease trajectory, a health index (HI) model will be constructed by synthesizing the degradation information from multiple biomarkers via the development of non-parametric and semi-parametric data fusion schemes. Then, to predict the personalized disease trajectory, personalized prognostics methodologies will be developed that can offline predict and online update the personalized HI model via the development of multi-level degradation models and Bayesian updating approaches. Capitalizing on the personalized prognostics methodologies, selective sensing methodologies will be developed to adaptively identify the screening tests that are most informative for the statistical estimation of the HI via a seamlessly integration of a novel Bayesian network model with robust optimization techniques. A team of five PIs with diverse but complementary research backgrounds will be working closely with two leading AD research institutes in the U.S. to develop, test, and validate the methodologies.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,3702 Spectrum Blvd.,Tampa,US,Tampa,FL14,University of South Florida,FL,336129446,47.041,"['Kewei  Chen', 'Bo  Zeng', 'Brent  Small']",06/24/2014,069687242,224270,11/30/2014,4900,SERVICE ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS,0,1435584,069687242,Shuai  Huang,4202 East Fowler Avenue,Tampa,US,Tampa,FL14,University of South Florida,FL,336209951,shuai.huang.ie@gmail.com,Shuai,Huang,,2065431428,@nsf.gov,,,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,,09/01/2014,"Collaborative Research: Data-Driven Smart Monitoring of Alzheimer's Disease via Data Fusion, Personalized Prognostics, and Selective Sensing",Grant

Title: CAREER: Adaptive Electro-Braille: A New Tactile Sensory Substitution and Assistive Technology for the Blind and Visually Impaired

Broader Significance & Importance:

Advanced assistive technologies are critical to the well-being of the blind and visually impaired (BVI).  Touch sensitive displays that can be operated by a variety of users are needed to gain information by the BVI community.  Currently technology is not equipped with features that permit the BVI anytime/anywhere access and are not adaptable and convenient for use.  This research project will develop tools that are based on electronic scanning technology adapted to a finger-wearable touch device that can be used to scan a variety of objects including Braille text.

Technical Description:

In order to assist the Blind and Visually Impaired (BVI) community to ""see"", assistive tactile displays that are adaptive, sensorized, individualized, and portable are required.  Currently available tactile assistive displays are not equipped with features that permit the BVI to ""see"" conveniently. This long-term CAREER goal is to facilitate the advances in electrotactile sensing, rendering, and computation into the next generation of smart, individual perception-centered, and portable assistive display to aid the BVI as well to establish a user-friendly and networked infrastructure for enhancing healthcare, learning capabilities and education. In particular, the research objective of this CAREER proposal is to investigate an electrotactile based Braille display technology that is electronic scanning-style, adaptive tactile preference rendering, and finger-wearable. This technology is based on electrical stimulation, and has both online skin bioimpedance sensing and tactile preference rendering functions, called E-Braille. This technology will allow the BVI to conveniently perform important tasks, such as reading, typing in Braille, browsing the Internet, engaging in online conversations, and perceiving graphics. Further, combined with cyber-infrastructure network technology, E-Braille will allow the BVI to conveniently access more documents, books, and libraries, anytime and anywhere.  An equally important goal is the recruitment and training of the next generation of engineers who will emerge not only with a solid background in engineering and science disciplines but also have the passion and ability to contribute their expertise in multidisciplinary assistive and rehabilitative engineering areas.
	The success of this CAREER project will facilitate research to aid the BVI and will advance our fundamental understanding of electrotactile mechanisms. The major research focus is the development of an adaptive, individual perception-centered, and electrotactile-based Braille display for the BVI, known as E-Braille, which is unique as a fingerwearable electronic device, and will conveniently provide the BVI unlimited access to the information world. The display also will be the first of its kind to include online identification of individual tactile preferences as well as the ability for adaptive tactile preference tuning/rendering for individuals. Currently available Braille displays do not have these features. This CAREER proposal aims to advance the state of the art in portable seeing- assistive devices for the BVI. It will accomplish this goal through the development of EBraille, an affordable and innovative electrical stimulation-based Braille tactile display. This system will offer fast, refreshable information exchange. The proposed adaptive E-Braille will dramatically improve the quality of life of the BVI by allowing them to live more independently and with greater ease. As an integrative part of this project, the PI will develop educational materials inspired by the research results, directed toward students in multidisciplinary engineering program. The research results also will inspire an outreach effort aimed at attracting K-12 students, women, under-represented minorities, and persons with disabilities (e.g., the BVI) to study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines as well as to participate in this exciting and cutting-edge research project. Finally, both research and educational results will be disseminated by means of presentations at conferences, publications in peer-reviewed journals, web portals, magazines, newspapers, TV and other media, and to the community involved in BVI assistive technology and systems",NSF,4900,NEVADA SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION,1664 North Virginia Street,Reno,US,Reno,NV02,"Board of Regents, NSHE, obo University of Nevada, Reno",NV,895570001,47.041,,04/28/2014,146515460,418802,04/30/2019,4900,Disability & Rehab Engineering,418802,1352006,067808063,Yantao  Shen,1664 N.

The HIMB research community generates large amounts of highly heterogeneous data stemming from diverse experimental sources, such as DNA sequencing data, confocal microscopy image analysis, and environmental data sensors on the surrounding coral reefs.  The high magnitude and diversity of the data collected and used by researchers at HIMB impacts the island?s data network, the storage and computational capacity, and requires a modular and timely approach to data management with robust underlying infrastructure that can efficiently handle it.  Thus, HIMB has designed a complete upgrade of its cyber infrastructure. These improvements will take place in two phases: Phase I involves the upgrade of the entire HIMB Network, including the replacement of the central networking and data storage equipment, as well as the deployment of a single centralized HIMB wireless access network throughout the island. Phase II will provide a secure data storage facility and set of user-friendly, web-based data transfer and analysis software.  A description of the research facility and its faculty is available at http://www.hawaii.edu/HIMB. 

The new HIMB portal system will significantly enhance the ability of HIMB researchers to collaborate and share data with other researchers at UH and across institutions, as well as work with resource managers and NGOs to extend the availability and utility of their research findings.  HIMB will be able to extend access to HIMB data resources to faculty at UH Manoa main campus and Community Colleges for use in their courses and research.

Education and Outreach:
We are collecting observations of live coral images from the SensorNode underwater camera, which, along with confocal images of bleached or stressed corals, will be used in resource packets for teacher workshops on climate change and coral reef biology.  One such activity on detecting coral disease using fluorescence has been developed and presented at public science education events (Caldwell et. al, 2015).  We are also developing a website with archived images and videos of both live and fixed specimens that will be integrated into 3-Dimensional interactive display system for teaching purposes.

350,"The use of cloud computing has revolutionized the way in which cyber infrastructure is used and managed. The on-demand access to seemingly infinite resources provided by this paradigm has enabled technical innovation and indeed innovative business models and practices. This rosy picture is threatened, however, by increasing nefarious interest in cloud platforms. Specifically, the shared tenant, shared resource nature of cloud platforms, as well as the natural accrual of valuable information in cloud platforms, provide both the incentive and the possible means of exploitation. 

To address these concerns we are developing a self-defending, self-evolving, and self-accounting trustworthy cloud platform, the TCloud. Our approach in realizing TCloud holds to the following five tenets. First, defense-in-depth through innate containment, separation and diversification at the architectural level. Second, least authority by clear separation of functionality and associated privilege within the architecture. Third, explicit orchestration of security functions based on cloud-derived and external intelligence.  Fourth, moving-target-defense through deception and dynamic evolution of the platform.  Fifth, verifiable accountability through light weight validation and auditable monitoring, record keeping and analysis.

Our approach to fundamentally refactor the cloud architecture to explicitly enable security related functionality lays the foundation for truly trustworthy cloud computing.

The societal benefits are related to the advancement of the science to be conducted at this center using the acquired instrumentation, and through a strong outreach plan that involves curricula of a diverse suite of initiatives including training in research for undergraduates (REU), study semesters for Colby College students, workshops with the state of Maine, and specialized workshops such as have been held for scientists interested in single cell genomics. The acquired instrumentation will be used for hands-on training at student and professional levels that is very hard to find, in which the workshops can include start-to-finish experiences from DNA extraction through computational analysis.",NSF,4900,BIGELOW LABORATORY FOR OCEAN SCIENCES,60 Bigelow Drive,East Boothbay,US,East Boothbay,ME01,Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences,ME,045440380,47.050,"['David  Emerson', 'Jose A Fernandez-Robledo', 'Peter  Countway', 'Beth  Orcutt']",08/07/2013,077474757,535211,07/31/2017,4900,MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION,535211,1335810,,Ramunas  Stepanauskas,60 Bigelow Drive,East Boothbay,US,East Boothbay,ME01,Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences,ME,045440380,rstepanauskas@bigelow.org,Ramunas,Stepanauskas,,2073152567,kbinkley@nsf.gov,Kandace S. Binkley,7032928581,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Overview. This grant enabled Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences to acquire a system of instruments for genomic sequencing of environmental microorganisms, which greatly expanded the analytical capabilities of the Bigelow Laboratory Single Cell Genomics Center (SCGC; scgc.bigelow.org). This instrumentation enabled transformative improvements in single cell genomics technology, major discoveries in environmental microbiology, and the provision of access to single cell genomics technology to tens of research organizations on six continents.

Intellectual merit. Prior to this grant, Bigelow Laboratory scientists performing genomic studies were entirely reliant on DNA sequencing by external collaborators and commercial facilities. This has proven problematic, due to inconsistent data quality, months-long delays in data delivery, and limited options to optimize sequencing process for the specific needs of the Laboratory. Thanks to the newly acquired instrumentation, SCGC is sequencing &gt;20,000 microbial genomes in 2017, which exceeds the number of all microbial genomes sequenced worldwide in 2014. The data produced by new instrumentation has benefited multiple research projects at Bigelow Laboratory, spanning studies of ocean biogeochemistry, microbial ecology and evolution, parasitology and other fields. One of the ongoing projects is creating a Global Ocean Reference Genomes (GORG) database, which will serve as an essential component of microbial oceanography?s cyber-infrastructure and will vastly enhance the accuracy, value and interpretability of diverse marine omics data sets produced by the broad research community. Another research example is NSF GoLife project where single cell genomes representing tens of previously undescribed branches of the tree of life are sequenced in order to better understand the early evolution of life on our planet. The acquired instrumentation played a critical role in the development of several critical improvements in microbial single cell genomics technology, such as more efficient DNA amplification, integrated single cell genome and phenotype analyses, PCR-free cell identification and improved de novo genome assembly. The combination of these methods are a major step forward toward unbiased and scalable studies of both genomic and physical characteristics of individual cells and extracellular genetic elements - the fundamental units of diverse microbiomes. Apart from studies by Bigelow scientists, the acquired instrumentation also benefited tens of organizations on six continents, which gained access to new services offered by SCGC.

Broader impacts. More than 100 postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students at Bigelow Laboratory and other institutions utilizing SCGC services have been involved in the analysis of genomic sequences produced by the acquired instrumentation. The ultimate goals of these projects range from basic science (e.g. oceanography) to environmental monitoring (e.g. oil spills) and technology (e.g. wastewater treatment plants), space programs (e.g. search of life on Mars), energy production and bioprospecting (e.g. mining industry), human health (e.g. cancer, microbiome), law enforcement and national security (forensics), etc. Three technicians at SCGC were trained to operate these instruments. One PhD-level scientist was trained in advanced bioinformatics analyses to support whole genome sequencing activities at SCGC. Third Microbial Single Cell Genomics Workshop was organized by SCGC in 2015. A total of 72 participants attended the workshop, including 16 students, 13 postdocs, 32 principal investigators and 11 other professionals from 15 countries. New technologies that were developed by Bigelow scientists with the help of the acquired instrumentation were made available to the research community through pier-reviewed publications. Thermo Fisher Scientific commercializes reagents for our technology for improved whole genome amplification.

352,"This grant supports a workshop entitled ""EarthCube Domain End-User Workshop: Integrating Real-time Data into the EarthCube Framework"" to be held in June 2013 in Boulder, Colorado.  The primary objective of this meeting is to bring together users and providers of real-time data across geosciences disciplines to address community needs for effectively and efficiently handling and applying this type of data. Through oral presentations and in breakout sessions, attendees from universities, federal agencies and industry will develop example cases and explore issues related to gathering and quality control of real-time data that can be used to inform the cyber-infrastructure development within EarthCube.

 
Real-time geoscientific data has the potential to revolutionize the application of scientific data in contexts of importance to a broader audience. Such data streams are key inputs, for example, to operational forecast models and warning systems that inform the general public of impending hazardous weather. This workshop will have a broader impact by helping to build capacity among the community of real-time technologists and researchers whose work affects a wide range of users, including water resource managers, energy planners, farmers, school districts, disaster mitigation and relief planners, urban managers, utilities, cities, etc.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY CORPORATION FOR ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH,3090 Center Green Drive,Boulder,US,Boulder,CO02,University Corporation For Atmospheric Res,CO,803012252,47.050,,04/05/2013,078339587,95634,11/30/2014,4900,LOWER ATMOSPHER OBSER FACILITI,95634,1338425,078339587,Michael D Daniels,1850 Table Mesa Dr.,Boulder,US,Boulder,CO02,National Center for Atmospheric Research,CO,803055602,daniels@ucar.edu,Michael,Daniels,D,3034978793,lavallon@nsf.gov,Linnea M. Avallone,7032928521,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The importance of scientific data that is accessed immediately as it becomes available (i.e. in real-time) has been increasing, particularly in mission critical scenarios, where informed decisions about next steps must be made rapidly. Scientists need access to data just as soon as it becomes available in order to sample, analyze and predict dynamic and moving phenomenon such as hurricanes, severe storms and tornados, earthquakes and flood events. The EarthCube initiative (http://www.nsf.gov/geo/earthcube) was launched in June 2011 to seek ""transformative concepts and approaches to create integrated data management infrastructures across the geosciences"". The EarthCube Real-time Data Workshop sought to bring together a very diverse group of software and data professionals as well as geoscientists (e.g. seismologists, hydrologists, atmospheric and ocean scientists, etc.) to characterize the role of real-time data and improve its access within the scientific community.
 
Today, with the availability of advanced computer networking (such a satellite communications onboard aircraft), more real-time data is available than ever before. These real-time streams of geoscience data have the potential to revolutionize the utility and quality of scientific data to non-scientists and the broader public. For example, they are key inputs to operational forecast models and warning systems that inform the general public of pending disasters. Many researchers, policy makers and other members of the public need access to high quality real-time data. Examples include, but are not limited to, water resource managers, energy planners, farmers, school districts, disaster mitigation and relief planners, urban managers, utilities, cities, and larger municipalities.

 

This workshop has built capacity and sharing among the community of real-time technologists and researchers and helped define the needs of these groups to make real-time data more easily accessible and compatible. It is clear that the recommendations and developments that have come out of this workshop will assist in advancing research in the geosciences and beyond.

353,"Researchers are developing a cyber-infrastructure product that uses a Smartphone application in conjunction with a cloud-based counterpart to provide real-time information about people and places surrounding a user during the course of the day. This technology uses real-time semantic analysis and fuzzy logic to present the user with only the attributes of people and places that are of potential interest or benefit to the user. During the course of this project researchers plan to develop a framework capable of handling large volumes of short messages that can be processed in a short time and create a cloud-based infrastructure to perform real-time semantic profile matching to handle the workload created by all users registered with the network. Researchers also plan to design network architecture and protocols to facilitate the communication of potentially large amounts of data from multiple users with minimal interference in a relatively small spatial location.

People often find themselves in large groups in both professional and social settings, for example, at conferences, shopping malls, airports, and sporting events. Several people in these groups might share similar professional, social, and/or extracurricular interests and such knowledge could be beneficial to all. For instance, a researcher could find a potential collaborator, a businessperson a potential client, a student a room-mate and so on.

The funds were used to travel to two workshops held in Washington D.C during January and March 2013. The workshops comprised of intense training on customer segment identification through customer interviews. The customer discovery process has been the key piece in taking our commercialization effort forward. It has tremendously helped in shaping our product as well.

Intellectual Merit: The three months of intense coaching from NSF's I-Corp program taught us how to discover our customers. For our team Proximity, it was a tremedous learning experience as we had initially gone into I-Coprs thinking that the world was our market. Having spoken to a wide range of individuals in the several market segments that we thought we could potentially launch our software App in (dating sites, conferences, trade shows, career services), we were finally able to get a somewhat clear picture as to the segment that had a clenching need for our App AND was willing to pay for it. Our biggest take away from the 3-month I-corp program was:

(1) validating the need of our software by potential clients (we realized that there is indeed a market for it)

(2) identifying a viable launching pad for our software

Broader Impact: We narrowed down on a client segment, namely the University career services. Extensive interviews with students, career service employees and recruiters led us to believe that there was a burning need to bring to the recruiters the right recruitees at a career fair. Career service offices at Universities today are facing an existential question due to the dominance of web-based services like LinkedIn. Students are losing interest in doing their homework on the myriad companies that throng a career fair and recruiters are faced with recruitees who visit their booth absolutely uninformed. This is leading the Career Servive office to see a less turnout at the career fairs both of recruiters and recruitees.

With our software App ""Proximity"" we intend to show the students just the right recruiters for them at any given career fair. This saves time for the students, holds their interest and takes away the overhead of having to do their ""homework"" on all the recruiters present at the career fair.

The recruiters on the other hand benefit by having a targeted, interested and the ""right"" match of recruitees visiting their booth. This saves them time as well by automatically filtering out candidates who are not a good fits to that recruiter.

Overall, the career service will see a boost in attendance both from the recruiters and the recruitees at a fair, thereby justifying their existence on campus.

In addition to dialogue on advanced networking, this program has provided a more robust and stable environment for additional ongoing collaborations, including support for addressing the challenges of remote campus deployments between US universities and China, and promotion of scientific interaction between the two countries.

The project improved mutual understanding between US and Chinese partners via sustained interaction and engagement, provided a meeting space for the US and Chinese networking and science communities to engage in a wide variety of collaborative advanced networking discussions and to set an agenda for future US-Chinese collaborations, and sustained interaction through working groups to facilitate understanding of global network technology and knowledge. It also resulted in the establishment of a multi-institution coordinating committee and coordination of four CANS workshops (two in China and two in the US) that served as opportunities to review program progress and working group activities. In the process, it enhanced the basis of US universities increasing their research and educational links with China, and facilitated interaction between scientists in multiple disciplines in the US and China to address the role of network cyberinfrastructure in accommodating increased scientific partnerships. As a result, it promoted understanding between the U.S. and China networking communities, enhanced interoperability between the research infrastructures established in each country, supported and stimulated international science and research collaborations across a broad range of disciplines between the U.S. and China, and enhanced US-China and global engagement by fostering interaction among CIOs and between NRENs to improve information exchange.

355,"Increasingly, firms and organizations are creating structured challenges to spur innovation and address both economic and societal issues.   Open innovation virtual organizations are formed to respond to a ""challenge call"" describing the need, providing specifications for desired solutions and setting a deadline for submissions.  Usually, this challenge call is delivered on a public forum with an invitation to those with expertise to share their solutions and an incentive for the best solution.   In addition, a cyberinfrastructure is established to support the development and delivery of solutions.  Solution proposers often participate in an online discussion forum where a social infrastructure is established with norms governing forum behavior.   At the end of the challenge, an award is announced to the best solution provider.

The incentives provided in most challenges inhibit knowledge sharing among contributors and collaboration is rare. Consequently, there is limited potential to involve diverse and unexpected innovation sources in solution development.  This project will develop a sociotechnical cyber infrastructure that manages the tensions inherent in open innovation virtual organizations to encourage collaboration among open innovation participants while mobilizing the energy and focus created by the competition of the open innovation challenge.  Through a series of open innovation natural experiments we will compare various interventions aimed at informing participants about collaborative ways to contribute and identify effective techniques.

Challenge calls can be an effective innovation technique applying science and engineering to important societal issues.  These new platforms are being used to find solutions for such diverse problems as developing an economical low energy use lightbulb, focused drug discovery, and reducing barriers facing returning veterans in higher education.  However, the methods currently used in challenges discourage the kind of collaboration that would be needed to leverage diverse ideas and generate greater innovation.

Collaborating with other people in a temporary online crowd (TOC) is even more difficult because there are few common norms of behavior or basic knowledge of each other.  Yet, TOCs are increasingly used to collaboratively develop innovative solutions to difficult-to-solve problems, such as new business strategies, global climate change, engineering challenges, and invasive species control.  Prior to this research, most TOCs were managed by simply asking crowd members to offer their own ideas. We questioned this approach because it failed to enable any collaboration among TOC members.  We developed a theory of online collaborative integration.  In this theory, we argued that if we could encourage crowd members to decompose the knowledge they have about the challenging question, it would be easier for others in the TOC to digest.  We built on a theory of collaborations in groups to identify decomposable units of knowledge in terms of problem objectives, examples, facts, and idea ""seeds"".  We hypothesized that, when TOCs were asked to decompose their knowledge in this way and then create solutions that integrated this knowledge, the solutions would be more innovative than solutions created by TOC members only sharing their ideas.  

To test our hypothesis, we developed a partnership with a company providing crowdsourcing over the internet.  Crowdsourcing features included providing an internet address for organizations to announce challenging questions for the public to address, inviting selected members of the public to participate in the challenge, displaying ideas posted by participants, allowing participants to comment on others? ideas, and displaying a variety of metrics about which participants were the most active, and which ideas received the most comments.   We needed to make substantial changes to the website so that participants could share not only their ideas but also share decomposable units of knowledge and then be able to foster participants integrating the units of knowledge into innovative solutions to the challenging question being addressed.  We then spent 2 years contacting organizations and eventually conducting 24 crowdsourcing events.  The events were randomly allocated to either the website asking participants to decompose their knowledge, or to the more traditional way of asking participants only for their ideas. 

We found that the approach of asking participants to decompose their knowledge and then integrate others' decomposed knowledge yielded more innovative solutions than the traditional way.  We also found a very particular sequence of different people sharing their decomposed knowledge which was associated with the most innovative solutions.  This sequence involved participants first posting objectives, then a participant posing the different objectives as a single paradoxical objective (e.g., offering real time services to a customer, yet not invading the customer's privacy), then other participants validating the paradox with an example or a fact, and an idea seed showing that the paradox helps to generate new ideas. The final step in the sequence was an innovative solution being posted that integrated different prior posts.  Since the precise order in which this knowledge was posted was NOT guided, it?s a relative enigma as to why this pattern emerged.  We speculate that the paradox serves as a sort of attractor for creative people that leads to more innovative solutions.

Another finding from our research is that internal crowdsourcing allows front-line service workers the opportunity to constructively participate in company problem-solving.  The existing literature supports the process of employees being able to voice their complaints, but helping employees engage in solving the problems they identify provides additional ways to foster employee engagement in the company.  Additional findings include factors that support knowledge integration during crowdsourcing, different roles that TOC members self-selectively decide to enact during the crowdsourcing event to encourage collaboration, organizational design factors to support collaborative innovation during crowdsourcing, and platform design principles for fostering collaborative innovation.

356,"This project will develop and evaluate an innovative research tool, based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), to support qualitative social science research, specifically content analysis. Content analysis is a qualitative research technique for finding evidence of concepts of theoretical interest using text rather than numbers as its raw data.  The process of identifying and labeling significant features in text is referred to as ""coding,"" and the result of such an analysis is a text annotated with codes for the concepts exhibited. This technique has become increasingly popular and more applicable as the volume of available ""born-digital"" text has exploded.  However, the reliance on manual analysis of the text limits the scale and scope of content analysis research.

In this project, the problem of coding qualitative data is conceptualized as an information extraction problem amenable to automation using NLP. However, rather than seeking to automate the process, the technologies will be used in a supporting role, creating a human-computer partnership. ML will be used to induce NLP rules from examples of coded text, avoiding the need to develop rules manually. To reduce the amount of training data needed from the human participants, an active learning process will be employed, in which a few hand-coded examples are used to create an initial model that can be further evolved through interaction with the user. These approaches will be combined in a prototype tool to support qualitative content analysis. As a demonstration and test of the tool, it will be applied to current and novel studies of cyber-infrastructure-supported distributed groups, specifically free/libre open source software development teams, and then to a broad range of social science research problems. This broad usage will also provide a test of the generalizability of a socio-computational approach to this problem.

The intellectual merit of the research is four-fold.  First, the proposal seeks to develop a novel socio-computational system that supports a human-computer partnership through the integration of information extraction and active learning. Second, a validation study will apply the tool to a diverse set of codes, providing evidence of the generality and limits of a socio-computational approach.  Third, the demonstration studies using the tool will contribute to research on distributed groups.  Finally, the project addresses a fundamental methodological problem in the broad domain of qualitative research, namely dealing with large quantities of unstructured qualitative data, by applying innovative computer-support.  By avoiding the need for hand-written rules and reducing the required amount of hand-annotated training data, this partnership will make practical the use of a system for coding large quantities of qualitative data in various domains.

The project has numerous broader impacts. It will benefit society by providing useful infrastructure for research in the form of a content analysis tool for scientific research and in for the form of corpora of annotated data for use in future Natural Language Processing research. The demonstration studies will provide generalizable knowledge to improve the effectiveness of distributed groups, an increasingly important mode of organization.

Glinert,7032928930,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The research of many scientists may need to examine text for evidence of particular concepts and use them to analyze differences between their objects of study. For example, a researcher might study organizational behavior by looking at how often different types of people in the organization express concepts like ""appreciation"" or ""inclusion"" in their group emails.  A common research method is ""content analysis"" in which the researchers develop rules to reliably and consistently label evidence of such concepts in order to attach appropriate labels to pieces of text.  However, in the era of big data with millions of text documents, this human annotation method is not feasible to handle such large amounts of data.
This project implemented a software tool that enables scientists to use these research methods on large quantities of text in a semi-automated fashion.  The tool starts with machine learning that uses human-annotated text to learn a model to predict labels in text.  Typically, the initial model will not be sufficiently accurate so the tool uses active learning to semi-automatically analyze the text. It works in partnership with the scientist by predicting the occurrences of concepts in small text examples and by getting feedback from the scientist to correct its predictions.  The examples are chosen to be corrected as the ones that the model is most uncertain about so that the machine learning can get the most informative examples and learn a more accurate model with a minimum of human annotation time.  The goal is for the software to produce ever more accurate predictive models until the scientist can use the machine learning to reliably discover the concepts in large amounts of data.
The tool was implemented and used with two different projects, one in leadership behavior and one in training citizen scientists.  The results are that the system could successfully build automatic prediction of concepts for some concepts, but not for others.  The concepts that were most difficult were either extremely sparse in the data, or they were concepts that were more difficult concepts for both humans and the automatic learner, due to the complexity and diversity of language used in the text.  In the future, we hope to apply new ""deep learning"" techniques for the semantic understanding of language in order to improve the tool to be successful on more of the concepts of interest to researchers.
The potential impact of this tool is that it will enable discovery from textual ""big data"".  It can enable researcher to address research questions using vast quantities of email, social media or other types of communications where it is impossible to do so using current techniques.

357,"Information technology is an established component of the infrastructure of modern societies, and cryptography is a cornerstone of information security.  Provable security quantifies the resilience of cryptographic constructions to attacks.  This quantification is often relative to the hardness of a handful of reference ""intractable"" problems like integer factorization.  Because of the intrinsic strength of heterogeneity, diversifying the set of intractable problems enhances the robustness of the overall structure.  This project responds to the challenge by building a foundation for cryptography from problems in combinatorial group theory.

The project capitalizes on earlier efforts on the algorithmic unsolvability of standard computational problems in combinatorial group theory like the ""word problem"", but looks at them through the lens of the probabilistic modeling, characteristic of modern cryptography.  The research objectives can be grouped into three main categories: 1) identifying efficiently sampleable distributions on which (variants of) the standard computational group-theoretic problems remain _difficult on average_; 2) developing new _hard group-theoretic learning problems_; and 3) exploring the implications of this foundational work to applications with enhanced cryptographic functionality, with the long-term goal of deriving group-theoretic instantiations of public-key cryptography with homomorphic properties.

Results of this project will enrich the theory and practice of cryptography with new tools and alternatives, stimulating for researchers throughout the cryptography and group-theory communities, thus fostering collaborations between the two fields.

underpin most defense and control mechanisms for the nation's
cyber-infrastructure.  But what underpins cryptography?  At the heart
of the modern approach to cryptography are mathematical guarantees
that code-breakers may only succeed if they manage to unravel
computational problems (like factoring large numbers) that are
believed intractable---too hard to be solved by the most powerful
computers even if left to crunch numbers for centuries.

Most cryptographic constructs in common usage today rely on a small
handful of computational problems from Number Theory that would be
easily solved by quantum computers, if (when?) the technological
hurdles to their construction will be overcome.  To anticipate this
eventuality, this project explored the mathematical field of
computational group theory as an alternate source of hard problems
suitable to sustain cryptography.

INTELLECTUAL MERIT

Previous work had looked at the intractability of group-theoretic
problems, but as it turns out, computational hardness comes in many
shapes, not all equally useful for cryptographic applications.  While
group-theoretic problems considered earlier do in fact feature problem
instances that are extremely hard to solve, these ""worst cases"" are
often very rare---too rare for cryptographic protocols, which instead
require that hard instances be common and easy to get by, that is,
that the underlying computational problem remain hard even in the
average case.

To discover suitable average-case hard group-theoretic problems, the
team of investigators on this project moved from a close analysis of
recent advances in the application of techniques from computational
learning theory to cryptography.  In that context, researchers had
discovered that the addition of random perturbations (also known as
""noise"" or ""errors"") can turn simple computational tasks like solving
simultaneous equations (which can be tackled with high-school algebra
methods like row reduction), into intractable problems, known as
""learning parity with noise"" and ""learning with errors"".  This project
led to a generalization of these learning problems that applies to
algebraic settings less constrained than the familiar ones of integer
numbers.  

This generalization in turn inspired the design of a cryptosystem
based on so-called Burnside groups of exponent 3, which promises to be
both very efficient and quantifiably hard to break.  In particular,
this project has shown that solving a random instance of this problem
is not any easier than solving an arbitrary instance.  This makes it
easy to harvest cryptographic hardness from Burnside groups, since
sampling a random instance always yields a ""worst case"" (for the
attacker, that is).

simulation of 3D seismic wave propagation, with a particular emphasis on 
computing on Graphics Processing Units, rather than traditional Central 
Processing Units, potentially providing an order of magnitude increase 
in simulation speed. The broader impacts of the proposal include 
open-source software packages for the simulation of seismic wave

investigate seismic hazard and aid in the determination of tomographic

Using 3D numerical simulations of regional and global seismic wave propagation, we constructed images of the crust and upper mantle beneath Europe and Eurasia, as well as images of the entire mantle on a global scale. These 3D images depict variations in seismic wavespeeds, which may be related to variations in temperature and composition. Mapping these physical parameters helps geodynamicists, geochemists, and petrologists understand the physics and chemistry of the Earth's crust and mantle.

Our global inversion is the most ambitious study of its kind to date. The 3D simulations were performed on a Cray XK7 named `Titan', a computer accelerated with 18,688 graphics processing units (GPUs) housed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. We used data from 253 earthquakes in the magnitude range 5.8-7.0. The model features enhancements of well-known tectonic plates, a tantalizingly enhanced image of the Samoa/Tahiti mantle plume, as well as various other plumes and hotspots, such as Caroline, Galapagos, Yellowstone, and Erebus. Furthermore, we see clear improvements in subducting slab resolution along the Hellenic and Japan Arcs, as well as subduction along the East of Scotia Plate. Resolution tests demonstrate that we are approaching the resolution of continental-scale studies in some areas, for example underneath Yellowstone, which is well imaged by the dense USArray seismic network.

This project creates and analyzes data on research histories of individual scientists. The particular focus is on the effect of research histories on productivity, and on the role of economic and social networks in six fields which account for the majority of scientific research: biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, medicine, and physics. 
Intellectual Merit: The proposal advances understanding in three areas.  The first is the comparative role of individual research histories and social capital on knowledge creation by individual researchers, particularly focusing on mobility.    The second is the factors contributing to the commercialization of academic computer science.  The third concerns the role of social networks in the productivity of scientific institutions.  In exploring changes in social networks, the work builds on new research and exploits the complementarity between networks and cyber infrastructure.  
Broader impacts: The research contributes to the science of science policy data infrastructure by making data available to researchers at the National Bureau of Economic Research and at RPI.

Individual Research Histories and Social Capital

 

Final Outcomes Report

 

Research histories of U.S. scientists and engineers form the nucleus of this study.  They are the essential first step that makes subsequent analysis possible.  To uncover the histories, methods of computer science are applied to data on scientific publications, with the aims and objectives of economics in mind.  With considerable accuracy, these methods determine whether the same name listed as author on a group of papers is the same person.  Once a scientist is identified as author on a group of papers, his or her research history is identified. This is because the group of papers contains earliest and latest years, most common field of science, employing institutions listed most frequently on the papers, numbers of papers per year, and citations received per year by papers in the future.  Clearly, this yields a research history that has a beginning and end, most common field of science, sequence of employing institutions, and time-profile of papers and citations received by the papers.  The study produces these histories for every scientist employed in all major U.S. research institutions, for each of twenty fields of science, during the years 1981-2011.  It must be emphasized that all histories are anonymous: a numerical ID represents a person and never a name.

Research histories are measures of accomplishment in social networks of scientists.  Using the methods of this project citation and collaboration networks become ?people? networks that are characterized by research histories.  In these people networks, every person is a node of the network with a research history that reflects a mixture of ability and opportunity that lead to prior scientific achievement.  Research histories make past scientific accomplishments observable. In citation and collaboration networks of scientists, research histories form ?social capital? surrounding a scientist, contributing to research productivity along with resources of the scientist and his or her research history.  With these observations in mind, let us turn to research papers produced by the project.

In the first paper, we study determinants of research productivity of PhD researchers employed by software and internet services companies.  In this case research histories include researcher productivity in graduate school, productivity of PhD advisors, and productivity of company research working groups.  We find significant effects of all three on patenting by the researchers.  Productivity in graduate school has the largest effect, company research working groups have the second largest effect, and PhD advisors have the third largest effect.  And yet, all three effects are highly statistically significant.

The second research paper studies the interaction between universities and economic growth.  The paper concerns the response to growth opportunities that differ by field of science.  The network of donors to universities responds to these growth differentials.  For students and families, private donors, and state and federal government, giving shifts towards fields where growth occurs more rapidly.  This network of responses adds to growth and increases the value of the university.  Using a panel of the top 150 U.S. universities, as well as 20 fields of science and engineering during 1981-2011, the paper verifies these predictions.

In the third paper, we characterize evolving networks of scientists and engineers at the institution and field level.   Science and engineering networks in the United States have become more densely connected, suggesting greater sharing of ideas and greater research efficiency.  Regression analysis of network density and the importance of individual institution-fields finds that growth in federal support of research is a key driver of density and importance.  Thus, science policy may contribute to rising efficiency of networks of scientists and engineers.

Using data on materials scientists employed in the U.S., the fourth research paper studies the comparative importance of individual research labor, individual research histories, and histories in surrounding citation and collaboration networks on research productivity of individual scientists. In preliminary findings, research labor and individual research histories are more important for scientific productivity in materials science than spillovers through networks.  However, spillovers from cited authors and coauthors also make important contributions to productivity.

In the fifth paper, we use network analysis to trace four historical shocks through networks of scientific institutions.  The networks consist of scientific collaborations and citations that encompass all major U.S. research institutions and fields of science during 1981-2011.  We study four major shocks: the breakup of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, the rise of Microsoft Research, the rise of Google Research, and the retrenchment, after the fall of the Soviet Union, of defense-related research in federal agencies, national laboratories, and science-intensive contractors.  For the breakup of AT&amp;T, preliminary results show that shocks spread beyond AT&amp;T, and that the decline within AT&amp;T leads to further decline in neighboring institutions.

360,"Tornado Alley is a large-format 2D/3D film and comprehensive outreach program exploring the science behind severe weather events. The project focuses on cutting-edge developments in the fields of meteorology and earth science, demonstrating weather monitoring technologies.  The project spotlights the current research of the VORTEX 2 (V2) project--the most ambitious effort ever to understand the origins, structure and evolution of tornadoes.  The principle target audiences are science museum audiences, with additional special attention to under-served, rural mid-western communities, which will be served by digital 3D screenings.  The film will be produced by Graphic Films and Giant Screen Films and distributed by Giant Screen Films.  The Franklin Institute will create and manage outreach to professional audiences. Informal Learning Solutions will conduct formative evaluation; RMC Research Corporation will conduct summative evaluation of the project.  

The film, produced by Paul Novros (PI) and directed by Sean Casey, will collaborate closely with the V2 team, led by Dr. Josh Wurman, and consult with the project advisors to assure clarity and accuracy of the science being presented.   A distance-learning initiative to serve educators--both formal and informal--will be managed by Karen Elinich (co-PI) of The Franklin Institute.  The project's innovative outreach strategies leverage the mobility of the tornado intercept vehicle (TIV) built by Sean Casey, and the Doppler on Wheels and MGAUS (weather balloon vehicles) to bring scientists and weather-monitoring technology into direct contact with audiences.  Outreach to underserved audiences, especially rural audiences, will provide opportunities for interactions with V2 PIs and their students, who serve as role models in science careers.  In addition, cyber infrastructure will allow groups of educators to interact remotely with V2 researchers and experience visualizations of weather data.  The film and ancillary materials will be translated into Spanish.  

The project serves as a model for the dissemination of the methods and results of a specific major NSF hard-science research endeavor to the general public through ISE products and activities. The goal of the project is for the audience to increase their knowledge and understanding of the scientific process, learn what meteorologists do, what technologies are used in meteorology and weather science and the factors and forces in meteorological events.  It is intended that young audience members will also develop and interest in weather science and potential careers in science and engineering.  In the first five years of the film's release, the audience is anticipated at 7 million plus.  In addition, the live outreach events are expected to engage approximately 40,000-60,000 individuals.",NSF,4900,"GIANT SCREEN SPORTS, L.L.C.",990 Grove Street,Evanston,US,Evanston,IL09,Giant Screen Films,IL,602014668,47.076,['Karen  Elinich'],09/14/2010,095541087,2300000,09/30/2014,4900,AISL,2300000,1010884,,Paul  Novros,3341 Cahuenga Blvd.,Hollywood,US,Los Angeles,CA28,Graphic Films Corporation,CA,900681327,PNovros@graphicfilms.com,Paul,Novros,,3238514100,vkass@nsf.gov,Valentine H.

Tornado Alley follows renegade filmmaker Sean Casey and the scientists of VORTEX2, the largest tornado research project ever assembled, on their epic missions to encounter one of EarthÆs most awe-inspiring events: the birth of a tornado. Over the course of the film, science begins to reveal the unseen architecture of these beautiful and destructive storms, and viewers are taken straight into the heart of a tornado. Tornado Alley features groundbreaking tornado footage and dramatic documentation of real storm chasing scientists at work, representing a powerful pairing of content and medium. The filmÆs storyline reinforces the message that ""science is cool and exciting"" and provides a unique outreach effort for the VORTEX2 initiative; ultimately the project serves as a model for the communicating the processes, value and impacts of scientific research to the general public through informal STEM products and activities.

The project built on the success of the producersÆ previous NSF-funded film, Forces of Nature, and its professional development component expanded on an NSF proof-of-concept project using Internet2 as infrastructure for PD. Program components included the giant screen film; a Web site; educatorsÆ guides and resources for classroom and informal learning; and professional development sessions utilizing cyberinfrastructure to facilitate remote interactions between educators and researchers performing actual data manipulations. Outreach allowed public audiences to experience, in person, the fascinating mobile tools of extreme weather research&mdash;including the armored Tornado Intercept Vehicle (TIV) and the NSF-funded Doppler on Wheels (DOW)&mdash;and to interact with the researchers who use and have contributed to the development of these pioneering technologies. Activities targeted public audiences at museums and science centers, as well as underserved, rural and tornado-affected populations, including Native American Indian reservations, through the use of a traveling digital 3D projection system.

Tornado Alley has taken more than 5 million viewers across the US and in countries from Israel to the UK on its mission across AmericaÆs heartland, and the film is anticipated to reach over 7 million during its theatrical life. The film has played in approximately 95 museums and science centers worldwide and was honored with the Best Immersive Program Award at the inaugural 2012 Jackson Hole Science Media Awards.

Tornado AlleyÆs outreach campaign brought scientists and vehicles to almost 80% of all museums exhibiting the film, and over 100 unique events reached approximately 150,000 visitors of all ages. The campaign also reached thousands of underserved students and families in rural, remote and tornado-affected regions in the South and Midwest. Science centers that hosted the project reported attracting unusually large audience and in particular, new and diverse audiences. Almost all of the participants contributing to evaluation reported engaging new partners. Over the course of the project, Tornado Alley and project scientists were featured in hundreds of media outlets (radio, television, print, Web). At the same time, the project enabled scientists to learn more about public audiencesÆ interests and needs. All agreed the film was an effective platform for disseminating weather science information to the public; some expressed newfound appreciation for how informal science organizations promote science and technology.

361,"As one of the most promising emerging concepts in Information Technology, outsourced computation (also known as cloud computing) is transforming our perception of how IT is consumed and managed, yielding improved cost efficiencies and delivering flexible, on-demand scalability. Cloud computing reduces IT resources and services to commodities acquired and paid-for on-demand through a fast-growing set of infrastructure, platform, and service providers.

Despite the relatively fast growth and increased adoption of clouds, our understanding of aspects related to their security, privacy, and economic value proposition -- and hence our ability to trust them -- is lacking.  This project addresses this challenge by (a) extending cloud service-level agreements to govern aspects such as integrity of outsourced services, information leakage control, and fair market pricing; (b) developing mechanisms that allow providers to guarantee and users to verify that such trust-enhancing service-level agreements are being followed; and (c) exposing trustworthiness guarantees and tradeoffs to cloud customers and system integrators in ways that are both practical and usable.

The research work pursued in this project is timely as it addresses the issues of cloud trustworthiness early enough to avoid having the conflicts among its various stakeholders develop unchecked -- as was the case with the Internet decades ago. Doing so has the potential of improving the utility and hardness of our cyber-infrastructure, with significant benefit to our economy and society.

This project addressed the privacy of data stored in a cloud service, where clients outsource their data across a network, like the Internet, to a provider that guarantees that the data will always be available but is not trusted to keep the information private. Specifically, the investigators considered the scenario where a user stores a collection of data items (e.g., documents, email messages, database tables) on a cloud computing service and periodically issues queries to retrieve data items or associated metadata. For example, the user can perform a keyword search to obtain from the service a list of relevant items and then download specific items from the service. The participants developed methods, known as oblivious RAM (ORAM) simulation and oblivious storage (OS), that allow the user to verify the integrity and completeness of the responses returned by the cloud service while keeping a small amount of metadata in secure private storage. An important and influential aspect of this work is that the participants were able to design general techniques for providing a high degree of data privacy that go beyond standard data encryption to hide also the data access pattern from the cloud service. The PI also provided improved solutions to fundamental tools, such as oblivious sorting and shuffling, which are used in ORAM and OS implementations.

ENSURING INTEGRITY OF OUTSOURCED DATA

The investigators addressed the integrity of data stored in a cloud service. They developed several efficient schemes for implementing authenticated data structures, which provide cryptographic proofs that their answers are as accurate as the author intended, even if the data structure is maintained by a remote host. The PI and co-investigators presented techniques for authenticating data structures that represent points, key-value pairs, graphs, and collections of geometric objects. In this model, a data structure maintained by a trusted source is mirrored at distributed directories that answer queries and provide proof of correctness. This work has applications to the authentication of network management systems and geographic information systems.

MEASURING PRIVACY RISKS FOR OUTSOURCED DATA

The team studied quantitative measures for characterizing the privacy risks of data that is stored in outsourced repositories in the cloud and queried using a simple query-response interface. They identified and mathematically analyzed a group of attacks, known as Mastermind algorithms, for attacking the privacy of an entire database, through database cloning, which could consist, for example, of queries involving character strings or vectors, such as DNA strings, movie ratings, or social network friendship data. Based on reductions to group testing, the PI and co-investigators showed that it is possible for an attacker to take advantage of minimal amounts of privacy leakage, such as contained in a single bit that indicates if two people in a medical database have any common genetic mutations, or if two people have any common friends in an online social network. They analyzed Mastermind attack algorithms using theoretical characterizations that provide sublinear bounds on the number of queries needed to clone the database, as well as experimental tests on genomic information, collaborative filtering data, and online social networks. The quantitative knowledge that this work provided gives a tool to people to be able to guage the privacy of their data, such as friendship ties in social networks, when they store this data on websites that allow others to issue similarity queries.

362,"The world as we know it will be transformed by climate change with one-third of known species threatened with extinction, diseases projected to emerge in new areas, disruption of the ecosystems that provide our food and water, and urban environments at increased risk from rising sea levels. To diminish the negative impact of impending climate change, various strategies are being investigated, including societal ?adaptation? to increase eco-system tolerance. Climate change adaptation can include activities like managed relocation of species (like armadillos in Indiana), building habitat corridors to allow species to move into newly appropriate habitat, maintaining engendered species in zoos and botanic gardens, growing genetically modified drought-resist crops in newly dry regions, planting non-native trees to maximize carbon sequestration, or constructing large-scale levees to protect low-lying coastal areas like Manhattan.  Relatively little is known about the conditions under which climate change adaptation activities can be successful or about their potentially disastrous side effects.  Addressing this problem raises fundamental questions about the relationship of humans to natural systems that transcend disciplinary boundaries. 

Increasingly, policymakers recognize that evaluation of adaptation strategies must be integrative and interdisciplinary, informed by expertise in environmental science, law, engineering, and other disciplines. Adaptation to climate change necessitates an unprecedented mobilization, coordination and integration of data, information, and knowledge, enabled by emerging technologies and cyberinfrastructure.  This award creates a climate adaptation virtual organization linking people and shared resources to enable informed decision-making and novel research.  The Collaboratory for Adaptation to Climate Change relies on cyber infrastructure, data management, and computational algorithms including tools to generate ecological projections, survey data on expert opinion, an information clearing house on regulation related to adaptation, interactive mapping with geographic information systems, mining of social media on the issue of climate change, and data mining algorithms that integrate these elements to create forecasts under uncertainty. The Collaboratory promises to be transformative in its inter-disciplinary integration and will lead the science of adaptation to climate change. The ultimate goal is to make the Collaboratory a onestop-shop that encompasses multiple dimensions of climate change adaptation.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME DU LAC,940 Grace Hall,NOTRE DAME,US,Notre Dame,IN02,University of Notre Dame,IN,465565708,47.070,"['Debra  Javeline', 'Jessica J Hellmann', 'Jason S McLachlan', 'Jaroslaw  Nabrzyski']",09/02/2010,824910376,1550000,09/30/2016,4900,CDI TYPE II,1560000,1029584,048994727,Nitesh  Chawla,940 Grace Hall,NOTRE DAME,US,Notre Dame,IN02,University of Notre Dame,IN,465565708,nchawla@nd.edu,Nitesh,Chawla,,5746311090,rramnath@nsf.gov,Rajiv Ramnath,7032924776,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The Collaboratory for Adaptation to Climate Change is a resource for research, education, and collaboration in the area of  adaptation and climate change. It incorporates a multitude of tools,  which take several forms including biological simulation, searchable  clearinghouses of legal information, and dissemination of emerging  opinion from experts on the benefits and risks of adaptation. These tools can be used individually and in an integrative way to inform decision-making, research, and awareness. 

The research mission of the Collaboratory was to improve the  dissemination and integration of knowledge that will inform the  development of prescient adaptation strategies and policies. Goals of  the Collaboratory included:

Facilitating interactions among researchers and decision makers.
Providing a vibrant online medium that converts data into knowledge.
Enabling users to run simulations and visualize future scenarios.
Providing access to expert opinion as measured via repeated, national surveys.
Building an information clearinghouse of legal data and regulatory information about adaptation to climate change.
Innovations in machine learning, network science, virtual organizations, and visualization to advance the purpose and mission of the Collaboratory, and also generalize across disciplines. 


The Collaboratory received over 40,000 visitors from 187 countries and several hundred thousand page views. 

Key highlightsfrom the research project include:

Enabling species-focused vulnerability assessments. The suite of tools in the Collaboratory have focused on vulnerability assessment of species by working in conjunction with the practitioners. These include: the Nature Serve's Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI); the SPACES tool for assessing species range changes; OpenModeler; and machine learning algorithms developed by the Notre Dame team for Species Distribution Modeling. 
To respond to the need of robust evaluation of ecological niche models, the SPACES platform was developed for academics, policy makers, and natural resources managers to better understand the potential effects of climatic change on the location of a species? environmental niche and to compare and contrast the dozens of algorithms developed for the purpose.
Studying the efficacy of virtual organizations. An integral part of the establishment of the Collaboratory is to carefully study the formation of a novel user community, dissemination of educational material, information, and determine the effect of exposure to a fluid, constantly updated information environment on user?s decision-making processes. In order to evaluate this, we have taken both active and passive metric gathering actions by developing surveys and gathering and analyzing clickstream data.
Connecting and strengthening outreach to diverse stakeholders in the Midwest. The Collaboratory is the outreach and digital community for the Connecting Climate to Communities Initiative (C3I) lead by partners at the Chicago Botanic Garden. In December, 2014 the White House announced plans for their Climate Education and Literacy Initiative, which includes the Connecting Climate to Communities Initiative.
The Collaboratory motivated the establishment of the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index (ND-GAIN). The ND-GAIN Index is a navigation  tool that helps corporate and development leaders manage risks  exacerbated by climate change such as over-crowding, food insecurity,  inadequate infrastructure and civil conflicts. The Index shows a  country's level of vulnerability, and the readiness of a country to  successfully implement adaptation solutions. The tool is free and  open-source. Using over 15 years of data, across 50 variables, ND-GAIN ranks over  175 countries annually based on how vulnerable they are to droughts,  super-storms and other natural disasters and, uniquely, how ready they  are to successfully implement adaptation solutions.
Innovations in learning from imbalanced datasets to address the issues of high class imbalance, different types of errors, and data sparsity in species distribution modeling. 
Several research publications in machine learning, ecology, adaptation, political science,  policy, and law, and the nexus of these fields. 
Software and data dissemination via http://adapt.nd.edu, http://spaces.crc.nd.edu, http://www.nd.edu/~dial. 
Interdisciplinary applications of the innovations in this project to healthcare, learning analytics, and environmental sciences. 


This research project built a community of interdisciplinary scholars around adaptation to climate change, fostered dialogue among different teams adn organizations, and also had direct impact on citizen science. As part of the broader impact, the Collaboratory inspired the development of SPACES and motivation to house ND-GAIN at Notre Dame. The algorhimic and technology innovations in the Collaboratory research are also finding interdisciplinary applications in various fields such as healthcare, learning analytics, and environmental sciences. Various educational resources and joint classes were also established during the course of the project.  Collaboratory has thus not only had an impact on science and technology, but also has witnessed translational impact on the common good through benefit to humanity.

Fisher,7032924547,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"A wide variety of phenomena, such as the spread of diseases, opinions, attitudes and beliefs in social and communication networks can be modeled as a contagion process on a network. As the recent Ebola and Zika outbreaks have shown, understanding how such processes spread, and how to control them are problems of great societal importance. However, despite their ubiquity, and the widespread appreciation of the importance of contagion processes over complex networks, there has been an outstanding need for a systematic and rigorous computational approach for understanding them. For instance, though it was known that the structure of the underlying network has a significant impact on the dynamics, the specific mechanisms were poorly understood. The overall goal of our project was to explore the mathematical and computational foundations of contagions over large social, communication, and organization networks. The specific objectives included analyzing and computing dynamical properties of such system, developing fast algorithms for generating networks and computing their properties, and designing interventions to control the dynamics, e.g., spread of epidemics. We have made significant strides on all of these objectives, as discussed below.

1. As a unifying mathematical framework, we developed the theory of graph dynamical systems, which is able to capture a variety of contagion processes. Our results lead to novel characterizations of the dynamics in terms of network structure for both simple and complex contagions. We have also developed novel models of complex contagion, including a bi-threshold model, which captures phenomena where nodes might revert back to their original states, e.g., in the case of spread of smoking. We have also obtained new results on the sensitivity of dynamics to initial conditions and changes in the network structure.

2. Highly scalable simulation tools for general class of dynamical systems: we have developed novel parallel algorithms to simulate complex and generalized contagion over large complex networks. Turn-around times on the order of 1 to 4 hours are routinely realized for networks with 100,000 nodes and million+ edges. This compares favorably with the several weeks, if not months, generally required to alter and validate a focused simulator for a different diffusion process. These tools are now being made available through CINET, a cyber-infrastructure for network science.

3. Generating and computing properties of massive networks: we have made significant advances in generating massive instances from various random graph models with heterogeneous degree distributions. We have also developed novel algorithms for computing properties such as the number of triangles, trees and other subgraphs, and community detection in networks with billions of edges. Our results often give either the first parallel algorithms for some of these problems, or the first ones to scale to such sizes. Additionally, we have explored different kinds of parallel computing paradigms, and find that the best models depend on the specific problem.

4. Developing interventions to control dynamics: these problems arise in the context of policy planning, and we have developed new rigorous and practical results for a number of models, arising from different application domains. In the context of epidemic spread, we have used a combination of network models and agent based simulations for the first rigorous evaluation of specific policies being discussed in the public health literature, such as paid sick leave. Our results are based on the insights from the impact of the network structure on the dynamics, specifically, properties such as spectral radius and core decomposition. We have also studied game-theoretical aspects, which arise when individual compliance depends on their utilities and incentives.

In addition, our project has had significant broader impacts.

1. NetSE has supported 9 postdoctoral associates including 2 women and 26 graduate students including 6 women from computer science, economics, public health, industrial and systems engineering, mathematics, statistics, and physics, which reflects the multi-disciplinary nature of the project. 

2. Developing tools to support the response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak: we played a crucial role in supporting the outbreak response by the US Department of Defense. Some of the theoretical advances from this project were used in this response. Some of the big challenges during this outbreak were the lack of data and impact of individual and community level behavioral changes. We used the insights from this project to refine our high performance computing based simulations to improve, calibrate and forecast the epidemic spread, and evaluate policies for providing healthcare resources.

3. We have developed a hands-on science exhibit called VirusTracker, where the spread of an epidemic is illustrated using wristbands (a mobile app has also been developed). Players with the wristband are ""infected"", and can spread the infection to others by distributing wristbands. This has been deployed at a number of science based events, including the ""USA Science and Engineering Festival"" (USASEF) in 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016.

364,"The behavior of a communications network depends on the configuration
of hundreds to thousands of switches, routers, firewalls, and other
devices.  For example, a campus network may have as many as 2,000
inter-operating network devices and about one million lines of
configuration; whether the network operates correctly depends for the
most part on the configuration of these devices.  Human configuration
errors are the single biggest contributor to network downtime. This
project seeks to develop techniques to make networks easier to manage
by improving both configuration testing and synthesis. Testing takes
as input an existing network configuration and determines whether the
configuration is operating correctly.  Synthesis generates
configurations automatically.  The project draws on two testing
techniques to make network configurations easier to test: differential
testing and dynamic testing.  Differential testing generates test
cases to characterize the run-time behavior of two different programs;
analyzing differences in network-wide configurations can help testing
by allowing test cases to focus on the smaller subset of
configurations that change more frequently.  Differential analysis may
make testing more tractable by reducing the amount of configuration to
test.  Dynamic testing checks the correctness of a program by
executing it; this execution can be performed in a parallel ""shadow""
network, for example.  The expected results from this project include
tools for network operators to test and automatically generate
network-wide configurations for both enterprise and ISP networks.  The
tools will also be useful in graduate-level courses.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SYSTEM,21 North Park Street,MADISON,US,Madison,WI02,University of Wisconsin-Madison,WI,537151218,47.070,,07/14/2010,161202122,249999,08/31/2015,4900,RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS,249999,1017545,041188822,Srinivasa A Akella,21 North Park Street,MADISON,US,Madison,WI02,University of Wisconsin-Madison,WI,537151218,akella@cs.wisc.edu,Srinivasa,Akella,A,6088900122,jbrassil@nsf.gov,John Brassil,7032928950,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Networks form a key component of IT infrastructure today. They connect different entities wishing to communicate with each other, while enforcing necessary policies or constraints over the communication (i.e., ""policies""). To enable communication and rich policies, network devices (e.g., routers and switches) often require detail configuration in low level languages. These configurations specify a variety of complex attributes that ultimately help the network realize the constraints and allowed communication on hand. 

Unfortunately, these configurations are often very complex. As a result, they render network brittle. Making changes to configurations, e.g., to realize network new policies over time, may require network operations personnle to make detailed changes to the low configurations of multiple network devices. This is difficult and very error prone, and can cause networks to fail.

The goal of this project is to develop techniques that ultimately eliminate the need for network operations personnel to worry about the impact of low level changes. This has three components: (a) developing techniques that help us understand the nature of network configurations today and how they evolve over time, (b) develop techniques for modeling the impact of configuration and configuration actions in the healthy operation of a network and, (c) develop new abstractions that achieve equivalent funcitonality without the low level aspects of configuration management.

Intellectual merit: This project has lead to the first ever large scale studies of network configuration evolution, configuration management challenges and trade-offs, and of the impact of configuration and changes on network health. It has contributed new virtual networking abstractions that vastly simplify network design and operations, allowing operators to work at a much higher level than what today's configuration interfaces facilitate. Furthermore, these abstractions enable new network management functionalities that are simply not possible to realize using legacy constructs.

Broader impact: Results from this project has a direct bearing on improving the robustness and availability of the nation's critical cyber-infrastructure. They result in mitigating the impact of human error. Data sets and software artifacts from this project have been made available for public consumption. Results from this project have been tightly integrated into graduate and under-graduate coursework at UW-Madison. This project has aided in the development of 2 PhD theses and 2 Masters theses.

365,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). 

Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity: Earth moving by humans associated with agriculture, urbanization, and excavation re-contours entire landscapes and constitutes a major geological force within the critical zone of planet Earth. The Critical Zone, defined as the terrestrial layer extending from tree tops through the groundwater and into stream networks, sustains most terrestrial life on the planet. At a greater rate than ever in Earth?s history, erosion and excavation expose sub-soil materials and unweathered minerals, which mix into and within soils, and are transported as sediment loads through river networks from headwaters to estuaries. To quantify the impacts on the global carbon cycle of humans as geological agents, a multidisciplinary team of scientists from University of Delaware (UD) and Stroud Water Research Center (SWRC) will establish a Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) within the 1440 km2 Christina River drainage basin (CRB/CZO). Scientific investigations within the CRB/CZO, located in SE Pennsylvania and N. Delaware and straddling unglaciated Piedmont and Coastal Plain physiographic provinces, will test the following overarching hypothesis: Humans, by accelerating the introduction of minerals into biologically and chemically active zones significantly enhance the interactions between minerals and organic matter and create globally significant impacts on the exchange of carbon between land and the atmosphere.

The human footprint within the CRB/CZO spans centuries and current land uses include second growth forests, agriculture, and suburban and urban development This provides an ideal natural laboratory in which we will investigate fundamental biological, chemical, and geological processes within the critical zone along a gradient of human impacts. We will particularly focus on the sources, transport and fates of water, sediments and carbon from uplands to inland waters and from inland waters to the coastal zone. The CRB/CZO will utilize cutting edge technologies for real-time gathering of hydrological, physical and chemical data and advances in cyber-infrastructure that seamlessly merge real-time data with state-of-the-art graphics tools to provide timely open access to quality controlled data and supporting materials. Field installations and data management advances will enhance an extensive existing network of stations used for monitoring water flow and water chemistry within the CRB basin, including Delaware Coastal Waters, and will build upon a solid foundation of decades of research conducted by UD, SWRC, and numerous state, federal, and non-governmental agencies.

Broader impacts of the proposed activity: The proposed CRB/CZO will serve as a resource to the greater scientific community through open access to data and opportunities for research projects that take advantage of the enhanced monitoring network. The new Delaware Environmental Institute (DENIN), located at UD and DE Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) will partner with the CRB/CZO on outreach activities. Public outreach to stake holders within the Christina Basin is a critical step in making CRB/CZO data available to policy makers. Strong ties between UD and Delaware state agencies will enhance the sharing of environmental data and will provide outreach to the public and policy makers. Some of our outreach will be coordinated through the Water Resources Agency, part of the UD Institute for Public Administration. The Christina Basin Water Quality Management Committee, which includes representatives from 15 federal, state, and local environmental resource agencies, hosts an annual series of public workshops to identify the science needs of policy makers. We will incorporate science results from the CRB/CZO into these workshops with the goal of providing a direct interface between science and public policy. The SWRC maintains 4 full-time staff members to translate our research into educational programs for middle- and high schoolaged students, teachers, and citizen/conservation groups. Graduate students who are involved with the CRB/CZO will be advised by multidisciplinary team of scientists associated with the DENIN and with scientists at SWRC.

Intellectual Merit:
We propose to build an event-driven network, a continuation of the NSF VOEventNet, applying the event-driven technology to Astronomy. There are many large surveys coming online (CRTS, PTF, LOFAR, LIGO, LSST, SKA etc) that are scanning the sky repeatedly, to find what is changing and why. Observation can be caused by supernova, gamma-ray burst, blazar eruption, planetary microlensing, or other exciting astrophysics. In many cases, rapid dissemination and follow-up observation is the key to discovery, to get magnitudes and multi-wavelength coverage.

The new VOEventNet will ingest events from multiple event surveys, professional and amateur and disseminate them for free at all levels, from child to major observatory. Trigger (selection) criteria can be built precisely and individually. When an event arrives, these triggers (boolean functions) are run to decide if an action is to happen or not. These triggers will work with heterogeneous, multi-sourced data. Actions can include the moving and operating of a sensor, either human or robot guided, sending messages, fetching data to build a data portfolio, and running classification rules. Further, actions can cause the generation of new events, thus inducing a workflow. Events come in real time from an automated pipeline of a major sky survey or from a small college observatory or amateur astronomer doing follow-up observations. These authors have previously registered the semantic meaning of the parameters that will be used in the actual events, so that automated systems can be effective, real-time, semantically aware decision-makers. The new VOEventNet will use an international standard (VOEvent) to be part of the global event infrastructure, exchanging events with other event brokers, such as NASA's GCN.

Broader Impact:
We propose here a cyber-infrastructure for events that are created from real-time sensors. The sensor could be many things, for example a radiation detector at a port. Excess click rate of the Geiger counter creates an event that is automatically assembled with other data, such as country of origin, and decisions made, perhaps using an additional sensor, the results triggering another action. Only important events merit human attention. This ""Sensor-Event-Action"" pattern occurs in many other fields of science and engineering, for example early earthquake warning, network provisioning when an internet story becomes viral, leak or pollution detection, and many others.",NSF,4900,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,1200 E California Blvd,PASADENA,US,Pasadena,CA27,California Institute of Technology,CA,911250600,47.070,,09/11/2009,009584210,479100,08/31/2013,4900,STRATEGIC TECHNOLOGIES FOR CI,479100,0915473,009584210,Roy D Williams,1200 E California Blvd,PASADENA,US,Pasadena,CA27,California Institute of Technology,CA,911250600,roy@caltech.edu,Roy,Williams,D,6263953670,iqualter@nsf.gov,Irene M.

SDCI Data Improvement: Data Grids for Community Driven Applications 

Collaborative research between academic institutions is facilitated through the creation of shared data collections. The de facto standard for distributed data management is the Storage Resource Broker data grid (SRB) developed by the Data Intensive Computing Environment group at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC). The SRB is used extensively in national and international projects in support of data grids for sharing data, digital libraries for publishing and discovering data, persistent archives for preserving data, and real-time systems for federating sensor data. The SRB is generic cyberinfrastructure (software middleware) that is used in production managing over 2 PBs of data across scientific domains such as astronomy, biology, ecology, high energy physics, medicine, oceanography, seismology, and the humanities. 

Intellectual merit 
The SRB provides critical cyberinfrastructure by abstracting the main objects (files, streams, metadata, resources, users) needed for data sharing, discovery and access. Based on the experience in developing the SRB and feedback from a robust user community, we have found that abstraction of data management policies is also needed. To automate execution of management policies, we are developing the next generation of distributed data management technology called the integrated Rule Oriented Data System (iRODS). The system integrates rule-based data management with server-side workflow technology for executing micro-services (software modules that perform well-defined tasks). The ability to  characterize management policies as rules controlling the execution of micro-services makes it possible for the first time to define both user-specific and community-wide policies, automate the execution of the management policies, and validate assertions about repository management. 

The concepts behind iRODS provide a platform for developing customizable and verifiable middleware systems. The rule based system combines ideas and techniques from guarded logic programs (forward-chaining and backtracking), databases (triggers and ECA rules), and abstract workflow systems. Procedural and declarative semantics control modular software for not only customization but also program verification. The modularity provided by declarative chaining of micro-services enables rule-based validation of remote operation execution. The innovative application of management virtualization supports automation of policy execution for data grids, digital libraries, persistent repositories and archives, as well as educational environments that are expected to contribute to many of the scientific breakthroughs of the 21st century. The new approach enables planned evolution of all components of cyberinfrastructure that support distributed data management. 

This proposal has three aims: to maintain support for the SRB data management software; 
to develop and support the next generation of rule-based data cyber-infrastructure and to develop a transition framework to migrate to the new data management infrastructure. The aim is to develop evolvable solutions to bring the full power of a national cyberinfrastructure to communities of scientists and engineers. 

Broader Impact  
The SRB software enables inter-disciplinary data sharing as well as discipline specific collaborations. The customization and abstraction features of data management policies in the iRODS software will help both small and large communities share data using uniform cyberinfrastucture.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL,104 AIRPORT DR STE 2200,CHAPEL HILL,US,Chapel Hill,NC04,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,NC,275991350,47.070,,03/05/2009,608195277,2164954,08/31/2011,4900,SOFTWARE DEVELOPEMENT FOR CI,2164954,0910431,142363428,Reagan W Moore,104 AIRPORT DR STE 2200,CHAPEL HILL,US,Chapel Hill,NC04,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,NC,275991350,rwmoore@renci.org,Reagan,Moore,W,9199629548,mmcclure@nsf.gov,M.

AuburnÆs NSF-sponsored digital forensics partnership with Mississippi State and Tuskegee University has resulted in a major contribution to servicemen being medically retired from their combat injuries.  Auburn UniversityÆs effort has resulted in providing digital forensics retraining to more than 600 wounded servicemen and women. 

Our digital forensic training program was initially based on the highly successful digital forensics training program developed at Mississippi State.  At the completion of the training, service members had a basic understanding of how to process digital evidence, familiarity with concepts such as lawful search and seizure and chain of custody, as well as hands on experience with the tools and procedures used to process this evidence. 

Warrior Transition Battalions (WTBs) are units where wounded soldiers are assigned while they undergo medical treatment and await a determination whether they will be medically retired or returned to duty.  Assignment to a WTB is stressful.  Soldiers not only have to deal with a broad array of injuries, many if not most, also have to deal with an involuntary career change.  Providing soldiers a hands-on learning experience while they are awaiting the results of Medical Evaluation Boards is not only good for morale, it is also great professional development and provides very real assistance in their transition to civilian life. Soldiers that are able to return to duty will do so with increased awareness and skill in information assurance, a skill that will serve the DoD as a whole very well.  While our focus has been on Army veterans, servicemen in all services face the same issues and we have established relationships with Air Force organizations.

AuburnÆs implementation of an advanced forensics course continues the training begun by the basic course, but presents a much deeper analysis and a more ""whole solution"" treatment of forensic investigation, whereas the basic course is more task-oriented training.  After each of the basic courses that we have taught, students have expressed great interest in having us return to teach the advanced material as well.  We have taught our Advanced Digital Forensics at Camp Murray, WA, an Army National Guard Base and at Fort Riley, KS, Fort Benning, GA and Eglin AFB.

One challenge in working with wounded personnel is that their assignment to transition units is fleeting.  Our digital forensics basic course proved to be so popular at Redstone Arsenal that we designed a follow-on course.   Unfortunately, many soldiers depart the WTBs/WTUs before we can return to conduct an advanced course.  Our experience was that any soldiers still assigned to the WTB/WTUs when we returned to conduct the advanced course all signed up to take the advanced course.   The survey results were consistently positive from more than 90% of the participants.  Despite our best efforts, some participants signed up for the forensics program without really understanding what it was about.  Participants who hate using computers did not change that viewpoint as a result of our program.

Additionally, the instructors continue to be available for the students to contact even after the class is completed to answer any questions that the students may not have considered during class or experiences that occurred later on.  Post course follow up is one aspect of this effort we are currently working to automate and improve by extending our use of virtual machines.

Auburn University has successfully adapted our digital forensics outreach to high school students through the successful staging of the ""Digital CSI"" Summer Camp.  This camp was held in July 2010, June 2011, and June 2012 and July 2013 with more than 80 high school students participating in total and is now self-sustaining.

TU also involved a number of outreach activities: assisting in offering no-cost computer forensics training courses to AmericaÆs veterans, performed assessment, and conducted boot camps and summer camps at TU. AU and TU are just 15 miles away, and these universities worked very closely. TU assisted AU to conduct a survey of the students (veterans) of the forensics training courses. The results of the survey indicate that more than 80% of the participants feel the training courses are ""Good"" or ""Outstanding"".
TU also conducted three one-day Technology Boot camps, and two one-week CSI summer camps. The camps greatly promoted the studentsÆ interest in the area of computer science.
 
With the help of this project and other NSF grants. TU has successfully strength it capability in IA research, teaching, and outreach. As a results. TU has been designated as the National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE.IAE) by National Security Agency (NSA) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in June 2012.

ABSTRACT

PROPOSAL #: 0742504
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Beth A. Todd 
INSTITUTION: University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa
TITLE: GK-12 Sustainable Energy Systems

The two major goals of this multi-disciplinary project in engineering and mathematics are to 1)increase the professional caliber of our STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) graduate students and equip them with the skills and experiences to become future leaders in academia and industry; and 2)provide resources and support for the newly formed State of Alabama high school Engineering Academies and create materials that integrate engineering applications into existing high school and middle school science and math courses.  The multi-disciplinary theme of the project, Sustainability in Energy Systems, includes transformative research on alternative and traditional energy systems, including renewable resources in consideration of their environmental impact.   This project strongly emphasizes the integration of graduate research with K-12 education to collaboratively design and deliver K-12 STEM instruction. 

Graduate fellows will work on-site in the Sumter County schools.  Sumter County ranks among the poorest counties in the state and nation by every measure of poverty, including school performance.  The faculty and student body at all Sumter Co. public schools are over 95% African American.  Fellows, working with K-12 teachers, will be challenged to connect with students from different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds in an appropriate way to enhance knowledge and engage, motivate and build confidence in the students regarding STEM careers.  In addition, materials developed for Sumter County schools will be offered to other state schools using real-time and archived cyber infrastructure resources.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA,801 University Blvd.,Tuscaloosa,US,Tuscaloosa,AL07,University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,AL,354870005,47.076,"['Zhijian  Wu', 'Jill  Shearin', 'Kenneth C Midkiff Jr.', 'Pauline D Johnson']",03/14/2008,045632635,2982282,05/31/2014,4900,GRAD TEACHING FELLOWS IN K-12,2982282,0742504,808245794,Beth A Todd,801 University Blvd.,Tuscaloosa,US,Tuscaloosa,AL07,University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,AL,354870005,btodd.eng@gmail.com,Beth,Todd,A,2053481623,lregassa@nsf.gov,Laura Regassa,7032922343,040106 NSF Education & Human Resource,"One major goal of this project was to provide graduate students in engineering and mathematics with increased development of professional skills needed by future leaders in academia and industry.  These skills include communication, collaboration, and teaching skills.  Many companies sponsor engineers with advanced degrees from other countries due to the lack of US citizens who have the needed technical and leadership skills.  Over the life of this project, 26 graduate students participated.  Of these students, three are currently finishing their degrees, one is working as a high school math teacher, six are college or university faculty, and the rest work in industry or in government doing technical work for either the VA or the Army Corps of Engineers.  In addition to the students who participated directly in this project, materials that aid graduate students to become better leaders are being expanded to provide future students with additional learning opportunities.

A number of these graduate students also participated in international travel in the third world to give them a better understanding of the need for sustainable energy systems around the world.  An example of this included installing solar lighting in rural villages in Peru.  While the isolated location of these villages essentially guarantees that they will never be on any type of power grid, small amounts of solar electricity can change the way that their residents interact as a community.

A second major goal of this project was to integrate engineering applications into lessons in existing high school and middle school math and science courses in rural Alabama.  In addition to activities related to solar energy, a variety of activities were created incorporating topics such as energy use in prosthetic arms, wind energy, biomimetic heat exchangers, design to withstand earthquakes, bicycle gearing systems, water infrastructure and public health, and many more.

Several outreach programs have blossomed from the relationships formed between the University of Alabama and Sumter County Schools.  Now projects are available to students in other surrounding school systems in the state of Alabama.  These include Rockets and Racecars as well as Wow! That's Engineering! and others. 

Rockets and Racecars allows students to make modifications on small-size rockets and racecars to see how performance changes with design.  These platforms are used to give the students the opportunity to see various mathematical and scientific principles in action with engaging devices.  

While Rockets and Racecars can provide students with multiple sessions of engineering activities, Wow! That's Engineering! is a one-day event that immerses middle school students into the world of an engineer.  Activities often focus on a theme such as energy or design, and activities such as bridge building or creating a vehicle fueled by a renewable energy source (solar or wind) have been completed with middle school students from rural Alabama.

373,"Cyberinfrastructure (CI) is a critical enabler of national importance for expanding scientific discovery and industrial applications. To realize CI?s full potential, domain scientists need to easily run their existing applications on the CI available to them.  Scientists also need to be able to design their future applications in a way that allows them to take advantage of an ever-changing and growing CI. However, the current technology used to create CI applications presents two problems: (1) they are either too generic and do not provide the right level of abstraction to allow experts in diverse domains to easily code their application logic; or (2) they are too specific, in most cases following a stove-pipe development process, resulting in rigid and expensive solutions that do not promote the reuse of commonalities across domains.
 
Leveraging an innovative and successful international industry and university partnership called Latin American Grid (LA Grid) for this PIRE project, Florida International University's (FIU) School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida Atlantic University's (FAU) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, and IBM Research Worldwide (China, France, India, Japan, USA), together with the Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (Mexico), Tsinghua University (China), the Universidad Nacional de La Plata (Argentina), the Barcelona Supercomputing Center and the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (Spain), are developing methodologies, platforms, and tools for creating CI applications in a way that eases the application development process and makes the resulting applications more adaptive to future changes of CI. The approach is application-driven and is focused on: (1) supporting CI-enablement for carefully chosen critical application domains, e.g. hurricane mitigation, bioinformatics and healthcare, and (2) developing common methodologies, services and tools for CI-enabled applications in these domains. The technology and tools created by the partners have broad significance and utility to both scientific discovery and industrial/societal applications.

Students from U.S. universities, including underrepresented minorities, are engaged and each participant receives multiple perspectives in each of three different aspects of collaboration as they work with local and international researchers, in  academic and industrial research labs, on basic and applied research projects.  Consequently, PIRE students are able to participate in the full research pipeline from inception of ideas, through basic research, to practical applications with a wide choice of collaborators and international experiences.

By training a globally engaged workforce and by driving sustainable international partnerships with shared infrastructure and resources, through which faculty, students and industry scientists/engineers collaborate to solve critical and nationally-important complex scientific problems, this activity aims to have  a major impact on American competitiveness.  

This PIRE project is funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) with co-funding from the Office of Cyber Infrastructure (OCI).",NSF,4900,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,11200 SW 8TH ST,Miami,US,Miami,FL26,Florida International University,FL,331990001,47.079,"['Shu-Ching  Chen', 'Yi  Deng', 'Borko  Furht', 'Seyed-Masoud  Sadjadi', 'Pedro  Martinez']",09/18/2007,071298814,2277461,08/31/2014,4900,COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH,2279991,0730065,159621697,Seyed-Masoud  Sadjadi,11200 SW 8TH ST,Miami,US,Miami,FL26,Florida International University,FL,331990001,sadjadi@cs.fiu.edu,Seyed-Masoud,Sadjadi,,3053481835,jrobin@nsf.gov,Jessica H.

During the course of this project, we established fruitful, collaborative research and education relationships with 33 universities and industrial institutions (BSC, Delft, Eindhoven, FAU, FIU, Gamer7, IBM Research China &amp; India &amp; USA, INRIA Bordeaux, ITESM, Kaseya, McGill, NII, NTU, Paris Descartes, REIN, Tsinghua, TU Darmstadt, UCLM, UdeG, UdR1, UFF, UFG, UM, UMilan, UNCC, Uni-Bamberg, UNLP, UPC, UPF, UPRM, USP, Warsaw, and Yahoo!) in 16 countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Taiwan, and United States). Over the course of this project, we recruited 68 students from FIU, FAU, UNCC and UPRM from all levels of Bachelors, Masters, and PhD to travel to the above-mentioned countries and conduct research under the supervision of our international collaborators. Our faculty mentors and student participants produced one patent, 18 PhD dissertations, 17 journal articles, nine book chapters, 66 conference and workshop papers, and 77 posters. 

The CI-PIRE research research aimed to develop methodologies, platforms, and tools for better enabling CyberInfrastructure (CI) applications in a way that eases the application development process and makes resulting applications more adaptive to future changes of CI. We aimed to realize Transparent Cyberinfrastructure Enablement by addressing the following key challenges: High-level Visual Interactive Development Environments (IDE), Automated Code Generation and Software/Hardware Reuse, and Hiding the Heterogeneity of CI Architectures. To respond to these challenges, we engaged in research projects focused on CI Applications, CI Integration, and CI Enablement.

SDCI Data Improvement: Data Grids for Community Driven Applications 

Collaborative research between academic institutions is facilitated through the creation of shared data collections. The de facto standard for distributed data management is the Storage Resource Broker data grid (SRB) developed by the Data Intensive Computing Environment group at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC). The SRB is used extensively in national and international projects in support of data grids for sharing data, digital libraries for publishing and discovering data, persistent archives for preserving data, and real-time systems for federating sensor data. The SRB is generic cyberinfrastructure (software middleware) that is used in production managing over 2 PBs of data across scientific domains such as astronomy, biology, ecology, high energy physics, medicine, oceanography, seismology, and the humanities. 

Intellectual merit 
The SRB provides critical cyberinfrastructure by abstracting the main objects (files, streams, metadata, resources, users) needed for data sharing, discovery and access. Based on the experience in developing the SRB and feedback from a robust user community, we have found that abstraction of data management policies is also needed. To automate execution of management policies, we are developing the next generation of distributed data management technology called the integrated Rule Oriented Data System (iRODS). The system integrates rule-based data management with server-side workflow technology for executing micro-services (software modules that perform well-defined tasks). The ability to  characterize management policies as rules controlling the execution of micro-services makes it possible for the first time to define both user-specific and community-wide policies, automate the execution of the management policies, and validate assertions about repository management. 

The concepts behind iRODS provide a platform for developing customizable and verifiable middleware systems. The rule based system combines ideas and techniques from guarded logic programs (forward-chaining and backtracking), databases (triggers and ECA rules), and abstract workflow systems. Procedural and declarative semantics control modular software for not only customization but also program verification. The modularity provided by declarative chaining of micro-services enables rule-based validation of remote operation execution. The innovative application of management virtualization supports automation of policy execution for data grids, digital libraries, persistent repositories and archives, as well as educational environments that are expected to contribute to many of the scientific breakthroughs of the 21st century. The new approach enables planned evolution of all components of cyberinfrastructure that support distributed data management. 

This proposal has three aims: to maintain support for the SRB data management software; 
to develop and support the next generation of rule-based data cyber-infrastructure and to develop a transition framework to migrate to the new data management infrastructure. The aim is to develop evolvable solutions to bring the full power of a national cyberinfrastructure to communities of scientists and engineers. 

Broader Impact  
The SRB software enables inter-disciplinary data sharing as well as discipline specific collaborations. The customization and abstraction features of data management policies in the iRODS software will help both small and large communities share data using uniform cyberinfrastucture.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",Office of Contract & Grant Admin,La Jolla,US,La Jolla,CA49,University of California-San Diego,CA,920930934,47.070,['Arcot K Rajasekar'],08/27/2007,804355790,2867472,04/30/2009,4900,SOFTWARE DEVELOPEMENT FOR CI,702518,0721400,071549000,Reagan W Moore,Office of Contract & Grant Admin,La Jolla,US,La Jolla,CA49,University of California-San Diego,CA,920930934,rwmoore@renci.org,Reagan,Moore,W,9199629548,@nsf.gov,,,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,,09/01/2007,SDCI Data Improvement:  Data Grids for Community Driven Applications,Grant
375,"Materials Research Society (MRS) holds two meetings (the Fall meeting in December and the Spring meeting in April) each year.  These meetings are attended by a large number (about 6,000 or more) of materials researchers and educators. Since 1996, nine Materials Education related symposia have been held at MRS meetings.  These symposia have become a major forum where materials educators present results of innovative curriculum development, the use of new educational and pedagogical methods, lab and multimedia modules; discuss important current issues; and exchange ideas pertaining to Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) education.  The topics discussed in these meetings have also included increasing the public awareness and understanding of materials, and outreach methods. 

The Fall 2007 MRS meeting will be held in Boston from November 26-30, 2007.  The ?Forum on MSE Education for 2020? at this meeting will consist of invited and contributed presentations on current Materials Education related activities and two panel sessions. Invited speakers and participants include faculty from high school, community colleges, and undergraduate and graduate institutions as well as science museum directors.  The organizers will strive to have a diverse set of speakers from around the world. 

TECHNICAL DETAILS: The topics for discussion in this forum include several key issues concerning materials science education: (i) novel undergraduate and graduate curricula and courses, (ii) outcomes from selected NSF programs, (iii) approaches for increasing diversity in MSE programs, (iv) outreach through Nanoscale Informal Science education Network and other opportunities, (v) integration of cyber infrastructure, digital libraries and e-science, and (vi) international activities.

376,"Like the physical infrastructure of roads, bridges, power grids, telephone lines, and water systems that support modern society, ""cyberinfrastructure"" refers to the distributed computer, information and communication technologies combined with the personnel and integrating components that provide a long-term platform to empower scientific research. Scientists and engineers increasingly rely on the availability of globally accessible information cyberinfrastructure to drive research and education.

Cyberinfrastructure in the 21st Century will be involved in developing resources, such as supercomputers, high-capacity mass-storage systems, system software suites and programming environments, interactive visualization, large-scale data repositories and digitized scientific data management systems.

These will be connected by high capacity networks of various reach and granularity, coupled with an array of software tools and services that hide the underlying complexities and heterogeneity, while seeking to provide ubiquitous access and enhanced usability. Further, support will be needed for the training of current and future generations of researchers, educators, and technical specialists who will use and support these resources.  That  is where the work of this research team is directed.

377,"This research aims to methodically explore and categorize the various instantiations of design-based studio models and to investigate the benefits of interdisciplinary design-centered studio-based education on students' ability to identify and solve real-world ubiquitous social computing problems. Ubiquitous computing technologies blend digital, physical, and social spaces into a single socio-computing learning space that will fundamentally improve students' creativity. This project develops and evaluates two prototypical interconnected, interdisciplinary and collaborative design studios that will foster creative problem seeking and problem solving. In these studios, students from multiple colleges and departments, such as computer science, information systems, architecture, engineering, and management, will form interdisciplinary teams and use collaborative cyber-infrastructure to explore and address key socio-technical challenges in USC. Creativity will be stimulated through an emphasis on a design-thinking approach, semester-long design projects and real-world problem solving in a more interactive environment where they can freely exchange ideas.

Broader impact is achieved by deploying cutting-edge educational infrastructure and technologies in ubiquitous social computing that advantage under-represented student groups, so that these students are positioned as solution-creators for problems they will be uniquely trained to perceive and confront.

378,"This is an award for the construction of a Distributed Data Analysis for Neutron Scattering Experiments (DANSE) at the Spallation Neutron Source. It is supported by the Instrumentation for Materials Research- Mid Scale Instrumentation project program in DMR, the Office of Multidisciplinary Activity in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, as well as the Chemistry division in DMR and the Chemical Transport Division in Engineering Directorate.  The goals of the DANSE project are to build a software system that 1) enables new and more sophisticated science to be performed with neutron scattering experiments, 2) makes the analysis of data easier for all scientists, and 3) provides a robust software infrastructure that can be maintained in the future. The DANSE project was prompted by the development of the Spallation Neutron Source (http://www.sns.gov) (SNS). In 2006 the SNS will start to produce intense beams of neutrons to be used as probes of materials, molecules, and condensed matter. Neutron scattering experiments performed at the SNS will produce data of unprecedented detail on the positions and motions of atoms and spins in materials, molecules, and condensed matter. The raw experimental data acquired using the SNS instruments are not simple to interpret, and new software is required to transform the data into useful forms. Using several major advances in computational materials science that have occurred over the past decade the DANSE project will provide new data reduction and interpretation capabilities beyond what are available today. The DANSE project includes  a central resource activity centered at Caltech, and 5 components based at different institutions: diffraction led by Simon J.L. Billinge of Michigan State Univ., engineering diffraction led by Ersan Ustundag of Iowa State Univ. , reflectometry led by Paul Kienzle of the Univ. of Maryland, small-angle scattering led by Paul Butler of the Univ. of Tennessee, and inelastic scattering led by Frans Trouw of Los Alamos with B. Fultz. 
Information about the project is available at http://wiki.cacr.caltech.edu/danse/index.php/Main_Page
The project is helping to organize the neutron scattering science community in the U.S., and has generated worldwide interest. DANSE is a natural application for grid-based computing, and the layered design of the DANSE framework was planned for migration to the TeraGrid, or a similar future cyber infrastructure. The DANSE framework could be adapted for data analysis in other fields of science. An outreach effort has been planned as collaboration with education professionals at Iowa State University.",NSF,4900,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,1200 E California Blvd,PASADENA,US,Pasadena,CA27,California Institute of Technology,CA,911250600,47.049,"['Michael  Aivazis', 'Ian S Anderson', 'Kenneth W Herwig']",06/26/2006,009584210,11973270,11/30/2011,4900,MPS DMR INSTRUMENTATION,11973270,0520547,009584210,Brent T Fultz,1200 E California Blvd,PASADENA,US,Pasadena,CA27,California Institute of Technology,CA,911250600,btf@caltech.edu,Brent,Fultz,T,6263952170,gtessema@nsf.gov,Guebre X. Tessema,7032924935,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"DANSE: Distributed Data Analysis for Neutron Scattering Experiments was a software construction project. As a project, it had a fixed lifetime and produced one-time deliverables, namely software for neutron scattering experiments. The field of neutron scattering is quite broad, with many subfields covering different types of science from biology through physics. As a project, DANSE was organized in part by subfield. The software developed by the project can be found by visiting the release site:

http://danse.us/

Some of the software was designed to run on laptop computers, and was designed to give scientists quick interactions with their data. The SansView package is one of these. Some screenshots from SansView are shown in the image. SansView is useful for finding orientation preferences of molecules in polymer blends, for example. Other software from DANSE that runs on small computers is used to determine atom positions in crystal structures by modeling data from neutron diffractometers. A third subproject developed software to interpret data from neutron reflectometers, which might be used to find the layers of different chemical elements in thin films, like those used in magnetic recording media. Some software packages require high performance computing, and some were built into a web service. The user logs into a system with installed software and a database of similar calculations of how neutron beams are shaped by an instrument, move through a sample having atoms with realistic locations and motions, and exit to a simulated neutron detector. The image of intensity from inelastic neutron scattering shows ways to calculate the energy transfer and momentum transfer between neutrons and a sample of a polycrystalline nickel alloy. The image in part c used this web service to calculate the quantum mechanics of the electronic structure of the metal, and how it changed with atom displacements as they vibrated as phonons.

The intellectual merit of the DANSE effort was part in the discoveries made over the course of the project, but the main contribution was to make new tools available to scientists who do neutron scattering research. These new tools allow them to better understand the trends in their data, and how they come about from the positions and motions of the atoms in the materials.

The broader impact of DANSE comes in two parts, technical and social. The technical contributions go beyond the details of neutron scattering. New software packages were developed or refined, such as a powerful optimizer for fitting functions to data. Another contribution was a framework to set up high performance computing services on the web. These tools are still developing, but much scientific computing is likely to be done as a web service in the future. Considering the social contribution, DANSE was one of the first efforts of a scientific community, in this case the neutron scattering community, to come together and create a modern cyberinfrastructure. Developing new capabilities for scientific computing requires efforts from teams of scientists who can identify the types of software and hardware tools needed for their research. DANSE was an early example of such an effort.

Bridge columns are subjected to combinations of actions and deformations, caused by spatially-complex earthquake ground motions, features of structural configurations and the interaction between input and response characteristics. Combined actions/loadings can have significant effects on the force and deformation capacity of reinforced concrete columns, resulting in unexpected large deformations and extensive damage that in turn influences the performance of bridges as vital components of transportation systems. These effects should be considered in earthquake analysis and design of bridges so that significant earthquake damage and severe disruption of transportation systems can be reduced. The objectives of the project are to develop a fundamental knowledge of the impact of combined actions on column performance and system response and to establish analysis and design procedures that include the impact at both the component and system levels. The objectives will be realized by integrating analytical and experimental research where physical tests are driven by analyses and simulations that examine the system response of various bridge types under different loading conditions.  The analytical models are calibrated by experimental data and then extended to system response.  

The experimental program includes quasi-static testing of twenty-four large columns (fourteen will be funded by NEES) providing fundamental behavior including the impact of torsional moments at University of Missouri, Rolla (UMR), pseudo-dynamic testing of three large and four small scale columns with variable axial load, within a bridge system simulation, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), real-time dynamic testing of eight large scale columns with bidirectional, torsional and variable axial load inputs at University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), four tests provided by the University of Mexico (UNAM), plus an integrated experiment with three columns linked through simulation, conducted at UIUC by UMR.  Fragility analysis will be undertaken, leading to the derivation of probabilistically-based fragility relationships for bridges subjected to combined action. Simplified analysis and design tools will be developed as well as the necessary code language to change the existing practice. Design and analysis methods will be derived that will affect the earthquake design practice in the US and internationally. Coordination of an integrated test program has already begun between the US and Japanese researchers.  Analysis components will be done at UCLA, UIUC, UMR and UNR.

	An integrated education, training and outreach program, lead by Washington University, will span from 4th graders to practicing engineers.  Modules will be developed for teachers and professors that can be inserted in their courses.  Modules will be used by the research team in summer camps, visits to local elementary, middle and high schools, undergraduate and graduate courses and in continuing education courses. Specific programs are targeted towards underrepresented groups. To achieve its objectives, the project will utilize the NEESit cyber-infrastructure, state-of-the-art instrumentation and high-speed data acquisition systems, the NEES equipment sites at UNR and UIUC and the non-NEES site at UMR, which has committed to joining NEESgrid.",NSF,4900,NEVADA SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION,1664 North Virginia Street,Reno,US,Reno,NV02,"Board of Regents, NSHE, obo University of Nevada, Reno",NV,895570001,47.041,"['Abdeldjelil  Belarbi', 'Shirley J Dyke', 'Amr  Elnashai', 'Jian  Zhang']",09/07/2005,146515460,1420000,09/30/2012,4900,NEES RESEARCH,1426280,0530737,067808063,David H Sanders,1664 North Virginia Street,Reno,US,Reno,NV02,"Board of Regents, NSHE, obo University of Nevada, Reno",NV,895570001,sandersd@iastate.edu,David,Sanders,H,5152948044,jpauschk@nsf.gov,Joy Pauschke,7032927024,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Bridge columns are subjected to combinations of actions and deformations when subjected to earthquake ground motions.  These actions are amplified when structural configurations are complex and structures are irregular. Combined actions/loadings can have significant effects on the force and deformation capacity of reinforced concrete columns, resulting in unexpected large deformations and extensive damage that in turn influences the performance of bridges as vital components of transportation systems. These effects should be considered in earthquake analysis and design of bridges so that significant earthquake damage and severe disruption of transportation systems can be reduced. Current analysis methods, behavior theories and design practices do not take into consideration the full range of interactions, due to the scarcity of experimental data and a lack of behavioral understanding. 

The project has developed fundamental knowledge of the impact of combined actions on column performance and system response and has establish analysis and design procedures that include the impact. The project integrated analytical and experimental research where physical tests are driven by analyses and simulations that examine the system response of various bridge types under different loading conditions, and analytical models are calibrated by experimental data.  The experimental program includes quasi-static testing of  large columns providing fundamental behavior including the impact of torsional moments at Missouri University of Science and Technology (MUST), pseudo-dynamic testing of large and  small scale columns with variable axial load, within a bridge system simulation, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), real-time dynamic testing of large-scale columns with bidirectional motion, torsional and axial load at University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), plus an integrated experiment with three columns linked through simulation, conducted at UIUC by George Washington University in cooperation with the University of Houston. Extensive analytical work is being conducted at the sites listed plus at University of California Los Angeles.  In addition, educational modules have been developed at Purdue University that integrates the experimental results into the classroom and help to explain basic earthquake behavior to students.

Current the analytical tools that are used to design bridges do not combine the effects of torsion and bi-directional bending and shear.  The outcome of this project will enable designers to include these combined effects and model bridges more accurately to the impacts of seismic loads.

The project has addressed two critical issues for the future performance of bridges. These are (i) the effect of combined actions on the behavior and design of concrete bridge columns, and (ii) the interaction of these columns with the entire bridge system. The intellectual merit of the project therefore derives from addressing two related problems for which there is no current solution, and using the outcome to derive behavior models and design guidance to reduce damage and improve the safety of transportation systems in future earthquakes.

The project will enable engineers to design and construct safer bridges.  It is critical that our highway infrastructure remain open after an earthquake.  The results of this project will help to improve the system reliability.  The experimental data has been archived within NEES Data Repository for utilization by other researchers.

This project expands on the goals of the LOOKING project funded through the ITR Program. The PIs request support to investigate and advance the utility of cyber-infrastructure in remote environments taking advantage of two significant opportunities; a submarine volcano oriented field program in the NE Pacific occurring at the same time as a major computing and communication show-case, iGrid, taking place in San Diego. The PIs propose to take an early step toward routine, remote use of High Definition TV for real-time inquiry into complex seafloor ecosystems using a combined Keck-NSF-UW supported research cruise in September 2005. On this cruise, HDTV imagery of vigorous seafloor hydrothermal systems will be transmitted from the JASON Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) to the R/V Thomas G. Thompson, from the Thompson to UWTV in Seattle, then to iGrid in San Diego. The scientific research will focus on a suite of hydrothermal fields that represent one of the most vigorously venting areas known along the global mid-ocean ridge spreading network. It hosts hundreds of black smokers on many tens of sulfide structures that rise 20 to 30 m above the seafloor. The vent systems support richly diverse, chemosynthetic biological communities. The HDTV signal from the seafloor will be recorded on board the Thompson, where a field production crew will simultaneously record coincident scientific dialogues guiding the research focused on linkages among earthquake activity, hydrothermal output, and sub seafloor microbial productivity. A blended and compressed version of both seafloor and surface-ship live feeds will be transmitted via the Galaxy 10R Satellite to the UWTV Studio. At UW, the uncompressed imagery from sea will be mixed, with a third HDTV stream with a group of land-based students, researchers and REVEL teachers interacting via back-channel audio communications with the scientists at sea. The three full bandwidth video streams, and a continuously updated stream of contextual material, will be transmitted to the iGrid Conference. In anticipation of new research infrastructure being developed within the Ocean Observatory Initiative (OOI) and in keeping with iGrid tradition, the goals of this prototype effort are to demonstrate, for the first time: 1) the feasibility and utility of transmitting live, interactive high-definition imagery from the deep sea for conducting remote research involving land-based participants; 2) the utility and importance of pushing the envelope on bandwidth, signal quality, and feedback mechanisms required to capture the dynamics of complex remote environments for widespread distribution to land-based audiences, and; 3) the powerful potentials for follow-on programs leading to real-time, 3-D use of HDTV streams opening exciting new research and outreach opportunities for remote, precision operations upon arrival of cabled observatories. This is cutting-edge risky project that could 

Broader Impacts:

The convergence of many technologies that will be investigated in this proposal will empower scientists and educators from a broad range of disciplines and allow them to examine planetary-to-microbial scale system dynamics in remote and/or dangerous environments. For example, the capabilities investigated will allow multiple groups, including computer and ocean scientists, engineers, educators, students and the general public to observe remote deep sea volcano research taking place live with the highest visual fidelity possible using a satellite link. In doing so, the intent is to begin changing the way that society views real, dynamical ocean systems and the conduct of scientific research in general.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,4333 Brooklyn Ave NE,Seattle,US,Seattle,WA07,University of Washington,WA,981950001,47.050,['Deborah  Kelley'],08/04/2005,605799469,180000,07/31/2006,4900,OCEAN TECH & INTERDISC COORDIN,180000,0541442,042803536,John R Delaney,4333 Brooklyn Ave NE,Seattle,US,Seattle,WA07,University of Washington,WA,981950001,jdelaney@u.washington.edu,John,Delaney,R,2065434830,aisern@nsf.gov,Alexandra Isern,7032928583,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,,08/15/2005,SGER:  High Bandwidth Ocean Tele-presence:  An iGrid Prototype,Grant
381,"This project, focusing on the interdisciplinary challenges of environmental monitoring, environmental modeling and simulation, environmental information systems, and coastal studies, aims at improving recruitment and stimulating underrepresented minorities in the applied computer science pipeline. The work entails several challenging problems (e.g., sensor platforms, data collection, and forecasting), many related to climate research, some involving the development of autonomous vehicles for collecting environmental data, as well as developing tools for its analysis. The research, building on a real-time decision support system built on cyber infrastructure concepts, presents an opportunity to bring together CS, AI, GIS, visualization, data storage, data mining, networking, wireless communication, etc. Two research centers will play a major role in the research efforts, the Texas Coastal Ocean Observation Network (TCOON) and the Harte Research Institute for the Gulf of Mexico Studies. TCOON, a series of data gathering stations from Louisiana to the Mexico border, samples data on precise water levels, wind speed and direction, atmospheric and water temperatures, and barometric pressure. Measurement in turbidity, salinity, and other water chemistry are transmitted to campus via line-of-sight packet radio, cellular phones, via GOES satellite for storage in a real-time, on-line database. Projects involve real-time automated data processing, telecommunications/network protocols, tidal datum processing, web-based visualization and manipulation of coastal data, specialized sensor and data acquisition system development, and neural-network-based and mathematical forecasts from real-time observations. The Harte Research Institute for the Gulf of Mexico Studies will be dedicated to geographic information systems and modeling. Sample projects include:
	Remote Controlled Shallow Draft Vehicle, and
	South Texas Tide Modeling.
The first, involving human-centered sampling methods utilizes a remote-operated vessel for performing transects of water quality parameters. Interdisciplinary challenges such as remote navigation control, communication/networking, completely automated navigation with GPD, sensor control/data collection/processing, obstacle avoidance, fault tolerance/system recovery, real-time data display and visualization, and integration with geographic information sciences. The second, involving computational simulations and visualizations, is based on a criteria of ""goodness"" to evaluate the quality of predictions.

Educational and outreach activities involve seminars, faculty development, mentoring, curricular changes, and active recruitment.

382,"The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is not just another telescope, but a new approach to survey science and data-based astronomy.  Existing 6-meter to 10-meter ground-based telescopes all have relatively small fields of view and are operated in the traditional mode where a given project is pursued for a few nights at a time, after which different astronomers pursue data addressing a different scientific goal, possibly with a different instrument.  Although this approach can make great advances, there are some crucial scientific problems that need to be tackled more like a physics experiment, whereby a dedicated instrument is used for a finite period of time to address well-defined objectives.  This is LSST: a large survey telescope using a wide field camera to image the accessible sky repeatedly to very faint limits over a ten-year period.  The LSST data products will change every field of astronomical study, from the inner Solar System to the large scale structure of the Universe. 

LSST will map the inner and outer Solar System, study stellar populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, reveal the structure of the Milky Way disk and halo and other local objects, find transient and variable objects at both low and high redshift, and survey the properties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift.  Turning to far-field cosmological topics, LSST will explore the properties of supernovae to redshifts around one, uncover strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and baryon oscillations, and show how these different probes may be combined to constrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy. 

LSST is being built on the El Penon peak on Cerro Pachon in northern Chile.  LSST will have a unique primary-tertiary mirror of 8.4-meter diameter with an effective aperture of 6.7 meters and an imaging camera with field of view 9.6 square degrees, and will be devoted to a ten-year imaging survey over 20,000 square degrees south of +15 deg.  Each pointing will be imaged 2000 times with fifteen second exposures in six broad bands at wavelengths from 0.35 to 1.1 micrometers, to a total point-source depth of r ~ 27.5 magnitudes.  LSST's three large mirrors are actively controlled to minimize distortion, and the telescope structure is especially compact and stiff to reduce image motion and to enable rapid travel across the sky, maximizing the observing duty cycle.  The project is an interagency public-private partnership, with the Department of Energy accepting responsibility for the world-leading camera, while NSF as overall lead agency will support the site facility, the telescope, and the extensive and sophisticated data management.  Private donations have supported initial construction work that significantly reduces project risk, including the innovative primary-tertiary mirror, early site work, and development of sensors for the camera.  LSST will produce on average 15 terabytes of raw data per night and an uncompressed data set for the full ten-year survey of some 200 petabytes.  Dedicated facilities will process the image data in near real time.

The image archive and resulting catalogs will be widely and freely available.  A sophisticated data management system will enable work ranging from simple queries from individual users to computationally intensive scientific investigations that could use the entire data set.  The LSST Project is at the forefront of the information technology revolution and includes investments in technology, cyber-infrastructure, education, and outreach.  With one of the largest scientific databases in existence, the LSST project presents challenging opportunities for research into database architecture and data mining.  Education and public outreach programs are fully integrated with the research program and include engaging experiences for non-specialists, partnerships with museums, schools, and industry, and opportunities to challenge and encourage tomorrow's innovators.

383,"Vulnerability of electronic systems and particularly computing systems to malicious attacks through the insertion of software viruses or hardware Trojans is of growing concern to society.  This work is focused on understanding, detecting, and mitigating a potentially devastating type of hardware Trojans that an adversary or hardware hacker can insert in the analog component of many of the integrated circuits that will be fabricated in the future.

The class of analog hardware Trojans that will be studied are those that can be embedded as undesired solutions of the nonlinear differential equations that mathematically characterize the performance of an analog circuit that is typical of a design that would be obtained from a highly qualified and trusted design engineer.   This class of hardware Trojans is particularly problematic because their presence will typically not be observed through computer simulations during the normal design or verification processes.   Although the payloads these hardware Trojans can carry can be devastating, existing methods for Trojan detection or prevention are inherently incapable of detecting or preventing this type of Trojans.  An improved understanding of the vulnerabilities to these Trojans will be developed along with methods for detecting and mitigating the vulnerabilities.

By reducing vulnerability to these hardware Trojans, a more secure cyber infrastructure can be developed.  This should improve security of transportation, health care, financial, and military systems.

384,"NSF's major multi-user research facilities (large facilities) are sophisticated research instruments and platforms - such as large telescopes, interferometers and distributed sensor arrays - that serve diverse scientific disciplines from astronomy and physics to geoscience and biological science. Large facilities are increasingly dependent on advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) - computing, data and software systems, networking, and associated human capital - to enable broad delivery and analysis of facility-generated data. As a result of these cyber infrastructure tools, scientists and the public gain new insights into fundamental questions about the structure and history of the universe, the world we live in today, and how our plants and animals may change in the coming decades.  The goal of this pilot project is to develop a model for a Cyberinfrastructure Center of Excellence (CI CoE) that facilitates community building and sharing and applies knowledge of best practices and innovative solutions for facility CI.

The pilot project will explore how such a center would facilitate CI improvements for existing facilities and for the design of new facilities that exploit advanced CI architecture designs and leverage establish tools and solutions. The pilot project will also catalyze a key function of an eventual CI CoE  - to provide a forum for exchange of experience and knowledge among CI experts. The project will also gather best practices for large facilities, with the aim of enhancing individual facility CI efforts in the broader CI context.  The discussion forum and planning effort for a future CI CoE will also address training and workforce development by expanding the pool of skilled facility CI experts and forging career paths for CI professionals.  The result of this work will be a strategic plan for a CI CoE that will be evaluated and refined through community interactions: workshops and direct engagement with the facilities and the broader CI community.

385,"Multivariate networks -- datasets that link together entities that are associated with multiple different variables -- are a critical data representation for a range of high-impact problems, from understanding how our bodies work to uncovering how social media influences society. These data representations are a rich and complex reflection of the multifaceted relationships that exist in the world. Reasoning about a problem using a multivariate network allows an analyst to ask questions beyond those about explicit connectivity alone: Do groups of social-media influencers have similar backgrounds or experiences?

Questions like these require understanding patterns and trends about entities with respect to both their attributes and their connectivity, leading to inferences about relationships beyond the initial network structure. As data continues to become an increasingly important driver of scientific discovery, datasets of networks have also become increasingly complex. These networks capture information about relationships between entities as well as attributes of the entities and the connections. Tools used in practice today provide very limited support for reasoning about networks and are also limited in the how users can interact with them. This lack of support leaves analysts and scientists to piece together workflows using separate tools, and significant amounts of programming, especially in the data preparation step.

MultiNet aims to change the landscape of visual analysis capabilities for reasoning about and analyzing multivariate networks. The web-based tool, along with an underlying plug-in-based framework, will support three core capabilities: (1) interactive, task-driven visualization of both the connectivity and attributes of networks, (2) reshaping the underlying network structure to bring the network into a shape that is well suited to address analysis questions, and (3) leveraging provenance data to support reproducibility, communication, and integration in computational workflows. These capabilities will allow scientists to ask new classes of questions about network datasets, and lead to insights about a wide range of pressing topics.

387,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY
This EAGER award supports research and education involving a new collaboration kindled at the MATDAT18 Datathon event focused on developing artificial intelligence methods to discover new materials or identify specific materials with desired properties for an application.  Methods involving computation, materials data, and the tools of data science offer the potential to find or design a material with desired properties much faster and at lower cost than traditional methods used by materials scientists and engineers. 

In this project, the research team will develop novel machine learning techniques to mine knowledge from various publicly available databases on materials and their properties. The knowledge thus gained can be utilized for material selection and design.  The team will focus first on using the methods of data science and materials data from a large community repository obtained from using computers and theory to calculate the energy needed to form a material from its constitutive elements.  

All the techniques developed in this project will be coded as software for different computers. Software will be released as open source codes to the materials science and data science communities via a number of mechanisms including the GitHub. This project will also provide educational opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students and a first-hand research experience in data analysis for materials science. Results of this project will be incorporated in appropriate undergraduate and graduate courses. Strong efforts will be made to include minorities and women. Results of this project will be disseminated widely via publications in journals and international conferences.

TECHNICAL SUMMARY
This EAGER award supports research and education involving a new collaboration kindled at the MATDAT18 Datathon event focused on developing deep learning predictors for formation energies and other materials properties. Large databases of computed material properties, such as The Materials Project and AFLOWLIB developed under Materials Genome Initiative, host properties of tens of thousands of materials. They are primarily employed to screen materials for various target applications such as photocatalysis and battery materials. Such databases can also be utilized to develop deep learning-based predictors of materials properties. These predictions are expected to be more accurate than predictions made using traditional machine learning (ML) techniques. 

Even cutting edge conventional ML methods such as Gradient Boosting or Random Forest of Trees have limited capacity, or the ability to learn, when compared to multi-layer deep artificial neural networks employed in deep learning to mine vast data. In this project the research team aims to develop a deep learning predictor for formation energy of crystals. The investigators also propose to develop other relevant combinatorial algorithms for solving this problem. Formation energy, which is the energy difference between the crystal and the constituent elements in their atomic form, is one of the most reliable properties available from these databases. The focus of this project is on fast and highly accurate prediction of formation energies and stability of materials by utilizing the superior capacity of deep learning systems and other algorithms to learn from big data.

The project will deliver a publicly accessible cyber infrastructure implementing a deep learning system capable of predicting formation energies for inorganic materials with an accuracy that is vastly superior to that of the predictors built with traditional ML models, and new forms of chemical representations of materials that can be reused to predict other properties of materials. One of the challenges in the employment of deep learning techniques is in the large training times taken by these algorithms. The research team plans to address this challenge with a variety of algorithmic innovations including novel parallel training algorithms. The investigators plan to employ a number of parallel architectures including CPU clusters and GPUs.

388,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this PFI project is in providing the manufacturing sector with advanced solutions for the early detection of machine malfunctions via continuous acoustic monitoring. Machinery malfunctions have significant negative effects on the manufacturing industry, including: unscheduled downtime leading to the under-utilization of equipment and staff; the production of off-spec products leading to waste of finished product and raw materials; as well as costly-repairs and inefficient maintenance schedules. All these effects increase the cost of manufacturing and can result in loss of revenue, directly affecting the margin of profitability, and thus the competitiveness, for these companies. By improving machine condition monitoring and enabling the widespread adoption of predictive maintenance, we believe our solutions can contribute to the growth of the US manufacturing sector, with all the significant ancillary benefits that entails. Better prediction of machine failures could also potentially affect energy efficiency, environmental impact and workplace safety in manufacturing operations. 


The proposed project will develop an integrated, Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) solution to continuous condition monitoring of manufacturing machinery. Our solution is centered around a network of low-cost, high quality, remote acoustic sensing devices with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) for sound recognition, that can automatically detect and diagnose the early signs of machine failure. Our novel focus on acoustic emissions, both in the audible and ultrasonic range, means that our sensors are non-contact and thus easy to install, capable of monitoring multiple parts per sensor, and able to produce earlier warnings than those possible with existing solutions. Furthermore, our use of AI for sound recognition results in fast and scalable analytics in real-time with minimal expertise required. We provide a unified cyber-infrastructure integrating edge computing, cloud data storage and an easy-to-use dashboard to facilitate navigation, retrieval and operation. This combination has the potential to result in a disruptive and transformative product that improves machine condition monitoring while significantly lowering the cost of deployment and operation.

390,"This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Professor Duy Hua from Kansas State University and colleagues Daniel Higgins, Stefan Bossmann, Jun Li and Emily McLaurin have acquired a hybrid 400 MHz NMR spectrometer with solution and solid-state capabilities. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The instrument positively impacts researchers across Kansas, particularly those primarily undergraduate institutions in the region. The team has cyber-infrastructure available to users to receive, manipulate and analyze the spectra remotely. 

The award of this hybrid NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts areas such as catalytic asymmetric C-H bond oxidation of alkanes and the synthesis of oligopeptides and fluorescent dyes. The spectrometer is used tocharacterize single molecule fluorescence of aldol condensation on heterogeneous catalysts and rapidly profilling protease using a multiplex method. In addition, it aids microwave-assisted ionic liquid etching of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals and the synthesis of dye derivatives for studies of heterogeneous nanostructures. The instrument also serves researchers studyingf A- and B-class dye-decolorizing peroxidases lignin degradation mechanism and applications and supramolecular chemistry of chalcogen/halogen or hydrogen bonding.  Finally, the instrumentation is also used to identify bio-inspired metal-organic-framework (MOFs) for applications in nanotheranostics, and for mechanistic investigations of olefin methathesis catalysts.

391,"Among the most critical components of today's cyber-infrastructure are concurrent data structures that coordinate work between sub-computations. These software components are notoriously difficult to implement correctly. While formal verification tools can guarantee the reliability of software, there remains a gap between the highly complex concurrent data structures found in real systems and the relatively simple ones amenable to today's tools. This project aims to close this gap. The project maintains a repository of software tools and benchmarks that is publicly available under open source licenses. The educational objectives include involvement of undergraduate students and the dissemination of course materials created for this project. These activities are supplemented by the investigator's continued involvement in outreach programs for high-school students.
 
Concurrent separation logic has helped to simplify formal correctness proofs for concurrent data structures. However, a recurring problem in such proofs is that data structure abstractions that work well for sequential software are much harder to reason about in a concurrent setting. The project takes a radically different approach to data structure abstraction that leads to a new semantic model of separation logic and can describe the complex concurrent data structures found in practice. The obtained abstractions admit proof rules that generalize over a wide variety of data structures. This gives rise to novel proof modularization techniques where abstract algorithm templates are proved correct once and for all and can then be refined to concrete data structure implementations, significantly reducing the proof effort compared to the state of the art.

392,"This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award will support the progress of science and advance the national prosperity and welfare by transforming how urban systems researchers use data analytics in their studies. Scientific progress in many operational problems in urban mobility, energy and water usage, public safety, and healthcare is limited by lack of access to real-world data. Currently, new models and algorithms developed by the operations research community are often tested on simulated datasets that may not reflect real operating conditions. Research supported by this project will enable the creation of a novel Computational Operations Research Exchange (CORE) platform that aims to overcome these limitations. CORE platform will allow researchers from different disciplines to leverage actual operational data and compare their methods and results on realistic scenarios. The exchange platform will also provide a mechanism to encourage cross-disciplinary collaborations, which are important to innovative solutions to complex societal problems. 

The project will use a Systems-of-Systems approach to build a re-usable cyber-infrastructure for operations research models.  With today's availability of open access public datasets, the platform will provide a plug-and-play paradigm which can share data, models and algorithms in a seamless manner, allowing researchers to effectively compare algorithms on real datasets.  The project will begin with three use-cases drawn from applications in energy, transportation, and urban analytics.  The PIs will design protocols so that these applications will be instantiated using data available across many different regions in the country, thus allowing models of similar scope to be tested using regional datasets.  The platform will provide generic model interfaces, where alternative model types will be allowed to work on common datasets for comparison purposes.  The PIs are committed to working closely with women and
minorities and will involve two women Ph.D students in this project.

393,"With funding from the NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, the ""Enriching the Undergraduate Experience through Personalized Learning and Mentoring"" program will support high-achieving, low-income computer science and engineering students with demonstrated financial at the Missouri University of Science and Technology. This four-year S-STEM Track 2 project will provide scholarships to 21 financially at-risk sophomores, in three cohorts of seven students. The first cohort will be funded for three years; the second cohort will be funded for two years; and the third cohort will be funded for one year.  In addition to the scholarships, students will receive faculty mentoring and participate in community building activities.  They will also receive help in one of their challenging computing courses through a new software program that can deliver personalized learning opportunities.

The objectives of this S-STEM Track 2 project are to a) increase retention and graduation rates of participating students, ideally to 100% within five years; b) attain 100% placement in jobs or graduate programs well-suited to participating students' talents and interests; c) evaluate the activities carried out during the project to identify best practices that can be scaled to larger student cohorts and adapted to other disciplines and institutions. Personalized learning support in the computer engineering and computer science courses will be provided to the scholars using the PERCEPOLIS cyber infrastructure developed by the investigators. Scholars will engage in professional development opportunities that aim to better motivate and prepare them for computer science careers and/or graduate education, with a blended learning approach supported by the PERCEPOLIS software that enables collection of data on learning outcomes and engagement.

394,"This project is basically a workshop to provide one year of funding for testing a valuable training initiative for analytical methods in paleobiology. An organizing committee will organize a 4-week long training program to include developing topics (e.g., data mining, spatial analyses) and other database resources in paleobiology (e.g., Neotoma Paleoecology Database). The training will be open to Ph.D. students. Multiple instructors will participate in the course. Course materials will be made freely available online. The aim is to establish a dynamically evolving training initiative that globally engages the broader paleontological community. 

The graduate-level training program in analytical paleobiology should provide new analytical tools to graduate students and have a lasting intellectual impact on the discipline and beyond. The session will be taught using the R programming environment, though other languages may be introduced by instructors as appropriate. The organizing committee will assess this first effort to decide if this effort should continue, hoping that in-depth training of PhD students annually will produce analytically savvy cohorts of future leaders of quantitative paleobiology equipped to spearhead future developments in the field. As importantly, the training will produce life-long contributors (and users) of an earth science cyber-infrastructure that has been rapidly growing in recent years.

395,"The goal of this proposal is to leverage photogrammetry from smart phones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to automate the quantification of waste debris. In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey and associated rainfall-induced flooding, a significant volume of waste and debris will be generated, especially in urban areas such as Houston and Beaumont, Texas. The management of post-disaster debris is an important issue faced by local and federal authorities: it contributes a significant portion of disaster management costs, can generate several times the annual waste generation rates of the affected community, and leads to higher expenditures due to error prone initial debris estimations. The current process to predict debris volume is inaccurate and inefficient, as it utilizes qualitative data from visual observation. The results of this study will improve the calibration of the flood debris estimation models by measuring debris generation due to Hurricane Harvey. This will aid in decision-making tools that ultimately will result in faster and more cost-effective debris management operations for future rainfall, tropical storm, and hurricane-induced flood events that continue to impact the Gulf, the US, and elsewhere around the world.

This RAPID project addresses the lack of post-disaster debris volume dataset by collecting ephemeral data through an automated smartphone photogrammetric app and UAV in Beaumont and other affected regions in Texas, and making the data available through open-source cyber-infrastructure databases. Debris volumes will be quantified by exploring the use of smartphones to automate the quantification of waste debris. In particular, smart phone images captured by the monitor, resident, or local government agency can be processed and scaled to develop a 3-D rendition and an estimate of waste volumes.

396,"The goal of this proposal is to leverage photogrammetry from smart phones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to automate the quantification of waste debris. In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey and associated rainfall-induced flooding, a significant volume of waste and debris will be generated, especially in urban areas such as Houston and Beaumont, Texas. The management of post-disaster debris is an important issue faced by local and federal authorities: it contributes a significant portion of disaster management costs, can generate several times the annual waste generation rates of the affected community, and leads to higher expenditures due to error prone initial debris estimations. The current process to predict debris volume is inaccurate and inefficient, as it utilizes qualitative data from visual observation. The results of this study will improve the calibration of the flood debris estimation models by measuring debris generation due to Hurricane Harvey. This will aid in decision-making tools that ultimately will result in faster and more cost-effective debris management operations for future rainfall, tropical storm, and hurricane-induced flood events that continue to impact the Gulf, the US, and elsewhere around the world.

This RAPID project addresses the lack of post-disaster debris volume dataset by collecting ephemeral data through an automated smartphone photogrammetric app and UAV in Beaumont and other affected regions in Texas, and making the data available through open-source cyber-infrastructure databases. Debris volumes will be quantified by exploring the use of smartphones to automate the quantification of waste debris. In particular, smart phone images captured by the monitor, resident, or local government agency can be processed and scaled to develop a 3-D rendition and an estimate of waste volumes. These estimations will be validated using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry surveys and which in turn can be converted using volumetric studies as well as other available debris volumes documented by monitoring companies.

397,"Modern, general-purpose file systems offer poor performance on microdata operations, such as file creation and destruction, small writes to large files, and metadata updates, yet these operations are pervasive on today's computer systems.  Underlying this problem are fundamental limitations of the data structures used to organize data on disk.  This project will explore the practical efficacy of a recently-discovered category of data structures, called write-read-optimized (WRO) data structures, which have the potential to improve microdata performance dramatically without sacrificing good performance on other types of operations.  This project will bring together a team of experts from theory and systems who can bring cutting-edge algorithmic advances into operating system (OS) designs.  To this end, the team will build a general-purpose file system for Linux, called FTFS, that uses WRO data structures.

Work of this nature has the potential to eliminate the current trade-off between data locality on disk and small-write performance.  This project observes that WRO data structures, such as B^epsilon trees and fractal tree indexes, can give comparable asymptotic behavior to a B-tree for queries and bulk updates, as well as support small updates with performance close to logging.  Preliminary work demonstrates that these asymptotic benefits translate to real performance improvements - up to two orders of magnitude faster than a traditional B-tree for some operations.  Modern operating systems have certain assumptions about how file systems are designed, such as inducing extra lookups during update operations (called cryptoreads). Cryptoreads cause update operations to block on lookups, thus throttling the faster updates that WRO data structures provide. The project will investigate OS support for WRO data structures, as well as redesigning WRO data structures to support the operations of a fully-featured file system.

The ultimate goal is technology transfer and practical adoption. The effort will advance the current state of the art in file system and operating system design.  Computers are a fundamental part of our society, with desktops and laptops permeating schools and workplaces, individuals carrying at least one mobile device, and scientists driving new discovery with supercomputers. File systems are the backbone of these computing platforms, and improvements to the efficiency of a general-purpose file system can improve the efficiency of our national cyber-infrastructure, as well as reintroduce flexibility into the storage stack needed to adapt to rapidly evolving devices.",NSF,4900,"RESEARCH FOUNDATION FOR THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK, THE",WEST 5510 FRK MEL LIB,Stony Brook,US,Stony Brook,NY01,SUNY at Stony Brook,NY,117940001,47.070,,09/13/2017,804878247,50757,08/31/2019,4900,Computer Systems Research (CSR,50757,1755615,020657151,Michael A Bender,WEST 5510 FRK MEL LIB,Stony Brook,US,Stony Brook,NY01,Stony Brook University,NY,117940001,bender@cs.sunysb.edu,Michael,Bender,A,6316327835,mmcclure@nsf.gov,M.

398,"Great advances in scientific discovery and human progress have often followed the development of new scientific tools that allow us to ""see"" well beyond our everyday experience. The Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) is one such tool that has revolutionized materials science by its ability to visualize a wide variety of materials under different conditions with the resolution of an atom. In the past, AFM has been used to render contrast at one frequency but these days it is possible to observe multi-spectral contrast in images at many different frequencies: in effect like an optical microscope being able to observe contrast through different filters. This research project will allow Purdue University researchers to work closely with an industrial partner, Oxford Instruments-Asylum.  The team will innovate methods to convert this multi-spectral contrast to quantitative physical properties to help in the design and discovery of next-generation materials for biomedical, energy storage, and consumer products. A comprehensive theoretical and experimental research and outreach program is planned to significantly advance the state-of-the art of multi-frequency AFM through a collaboration between Purdue University, Oxford Instruments-Asylum, a leader in the multi-frequency AFM market, and KTH, Sweden. The project also involves development of new courses in polymer interactions and multi-frequency AFM for students and enhancement of Virtual Environment for Dynamic AFM capability for multi-frequency AFM operation for polymers which will greatly benefit students and other researchers. 

The most important multi-frequency Atomic Force Microscopy modes today can be conceptually understood as nonlinear systems with slow and fast timescale dynamics. This project will undertake analytical perturbative, continuation, and experimental approaches to analyze these problems to yield a rich harvest of predictive insight into microcantilever motions, stability, bifurcations, and chaos. On one hand, this information will help operate multi-frequency AFM's in stable regimes, while on the other hand, the insight will help guide the operating conditions most appropriate to generate contrast on a specific material. Additionally, sophisticated computational tools and experimental validation will allow an unprecedented correlation between experimental observables in multi-frequency Atomic Force Microscopy and the local properties of soft polymeric materials used in electronics, biomedical devices, and consumer products. These tools will be made available to hundreds of researchers worldwide through the software suite Virtual Environment for Dynamic Atomic Force Microscopy on the cyber-infrastructure of nano-HUB. The work is a comprehensive study of the dynamical foundations of multi-frequency AFM, a next emerging frontier in the evolution of Atomic Force Microscope towards a truly functional, quantitative nanoscale imaging technology. The findings will be transferred to industry through the close collaboration with Oxford Instruments (Asylum). While the focus of the project is on multifrequency Atomic Force Microscopy, there is a clear trend towards multiple frequency methods across many imaging technologies; for example, in contrast enhanced ultrasound, electrical impedance tomography, and microwave imaging to name a few. Thus the approaches developed in this work could not only spill over to multi-frequency imaging methods in other biomedical or materials instrumentation but could also create opportunities for multi-spectral monitoring in micro- and nano-electromechanical systems.",NSF,4900,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,Young Hall,West Lafayette,US,West Lafayette,IN04,Purdue University,IN,479072114,47.041,"['Ronald G Reifenberger', 'Anil K Bajaj', 'Roger  Proksch']",08/21/2017,072051394,542406,08/31/2020,4900,"Dynamics, Control and System D",542406,1726274,072051394,Arvind  Raman,,,US,West Lafayette,IN04,Purdue University,IN,479072114,raman@ecn.purdue.edu,Arvind,Raman,,7654945733,rlanders@nsf.gov,Robert Landers,7032928360,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,,09/01/2017,GOALI: Visualizing and Measuring Nanoscale Properties through Multi-spectral Atomic Force Microscopy for the Design and Discovery of Novel Materials,Grant
399,"Society is increasingly dependent on digital machines due to miniaturization and seamless integration of mobile, cloud and network computing. This project's objective is to develop an understanding of the computational algorithms, and devise novel architectural methods that improve the efficiency of the devices and platforms that will execute cognitive computing problems. Achieving good performance and scalability for concurrent hardware has been widely acknowledged to be a hard and important problem. This project singles out communication as a grand challenge and proposes novel methods for systems ranging from single chips with many ""cores"" or processors, through tightly integrated and increasingly heterogeneous futuristic many-core machines.  The proposed research agenda provides for significant broader impacts related to (1) curriculum development and student training through industry collaborations and integration of cognitive computing in computer architecture curriculum, and (2) outreach through established Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) sites and supplement programs.

A set of auxiliary communication models are proposed to give the programmer new mechanisms based on hardware-supported explicit messaging to exploit fine-grained parallelism in the algorithms that represent cognitive computing problems. The resulting architecture and software concurrency choices are expected to expose many problem-algorithm-input-machine configurations, and solving for a near-optimal configuration in real-time is a hard problem. A novel situationally adaptive execution model is proposed that analyzes and captures this massive search space to pick the right choices in the spatiotemporally changing runtime settings.  The incorporation of auxiliary communication models in futuristic multicore and tightly-coupled many-core processors is timely as it will enable performance scaling trends to continue at ultra-energy efficiency: enterprises and US mission agencies will be able to deploy multicore technology in real-time embedded systems, such as self-driving cars.

400,"Volunteer computing (VC) uses donated computing time consumer devices such as home computers and smartphones to do scientific computing. It has been shown that VC can provide greater computing power, at lower cost, than conventional approaches such as organizational computing centers and commercial clouds. BOINC is the most common software framework for VC. Essentially, donors of computing time simply have to load BOINC on their computer or smartphone, and then register to donate at the BOINC web site. VC provides ""high throughput computing"": handling lots of independent jobs, with performance goals based on the rate of job completion rather than completion time for individual jobs. This type of computing (all known as high-throughput computing) is in great demand in most areas of science. Until now, the adoption of VC has been limited by its structure. For example, VC projects (such as Einstein@home and Rosetta@home) are operated by individual research groups, and volunteers must browse and choose from among many such projects. As a result, there are relatively few VC projects, and volunteers are mostly tech-savvy computer enthusiasts.  This project aims to solve these problems using two complementary development efforts: First, it will add BOINC-based VC conduits to two major high-performance computing providers: (a) the Texas Advanced Computing Center, a supercomputer center, and (b) nanoHUB, a web portal for nano science that provides computing capabilities.Also, a unified control interface to VC will be developed, tentatively called Science United, where donors can register.  The project  will benefit thousands of scientists who use these facilities, and it will create technology that makes it easy for other HPC providers to add their own VC back ends. Also, Science United will provide a simpler interface to BOINC volunteers where they will register to support scientific areas, rather than specific projects. Science United will also serve as an allocator of computing power among projects. Thus, new projects will no longer have to do their own marketing and publicity to recruit volunteers. Finally, the creation of a single VC ""brand"" (i.e Science United) will allow coherent marketing of VC to the public. By creating a huge pool of low-cost computing power that will benefit thousands of scientists, and increasing public awareness of and interest in science, the project plans to establish VC as a central and long-term part of the U.S. scientific cyber infrastructure.

Adding VC to an existing HPC facility involves several technical issues, which will be addressed as follows: (1) Packaging science applications (which typically run on Linux cluster nodes) to run on home computers (mostly Windows, some Mac and Linux): the team is developing an approach using VirtualBox and Docker, in which the application and its environment (Linux distribution, libraries, executables) are represented as a set of layers comprising a Docker image, which is then run as a container within a Linux virtual machine on the volunteer device. This has numerous advantages: it reduces the work of packaging applications to near zero; it minimizes network traffic because a given Docker layer is downloaded to a host only once; and it provides a strong security sandbox so that volunteer computers are protected from buggy or malicious applications, (2) File management: Input and output files must be moved between existing private servers and public-facing servers that are accessible to the outside Internet. A file management system will be developed, based on Web RPCs, for this purpose. This system will use content-based naming so that a given file is transferred and stored only once. It also maintains job/file associations so that files can be automatically deleted from the public server when they are no longer needed. (3) Submitting and monitoring jobs:  BOINC provides a web interface for efficiently submitting and monitoring large batches of jobs. These were originally developed as part of a system to migrate HTCondor jobs to BOINC. This project is extending it to support the additional requirements of TACC and nanoHUB. Note that these new capabilities are not specific to TACC or nanoHUB: they provide the glue needed to easily add BOINC-based VC to any existing HTC facility. The team is also developing RPC bindings in several languages (Python, C++, PHP). The other component of the project, Science United, is a database-driven web site and an associated web service for the BOINC clients. Science United will control volunteer hosts (i.e. tell them which projects to work for) using BOINC's ""Account Manager"" mechanism, in which the BOINC client on each host periodically contacts Science United and is told what projects to run. Project servers, not Science United, will distribute jobs and files. Science United will define a set of ""keywords"" for science areas (physics, biomedicine, environment, etc.) and for location (country, institution). Projects will be labelled with appropriate keywords. Volunteers will have a yes/no/maybe interface for specifying the types of jobs they want to run. Science United will thus provide a mechanism in which a fraction of total computing capacity can be allocated to a project for a given period. Because total capacity changes slowly over time, this allows near-certain guaranteed allocations. Science United will embody a scheduling system that attempts to enforce allocations, honor volunteer preferences, and maximize throughput. Finally, Science United will do detailed accounting of computing. Volunteer hosts will tell Science United how much work (measured by CPU time and FLOPs, GPU time and FLOPs, and number of jobs) they have done for each project. Science United will maintain historical records of this data for volunteers and projects, and current totals with finer granularity (e.g. for each host/project combination).

403,"To address the demand for highly skilled workers who are prepared to protect the critical national cyber infrastructure as well as the call for greater student completion rates of a postsecondary degree or certificate, this project at Lincoln Land Community College (LLCC) in Illinois is designed to create a competency based education (CBE) program in cybersecurity. Working with industry and education partners, LLCC will plan, develop and implement this learner-focused CBE program that will increase completion rates while potentially reducing the time and the cost to students. The program will build upon the current knowledge base of each individual student and eliminate unnecessary time and effort on learning objectives already mastered. Because there is limited research for CBE programs developed within existing higher education structures, this project includes a comprehensive evaluation component. Because many institutions in postsecondary education and especially community colleges are looking for innovators who have paved the path in CBE and are seeking advice for best practices and program implementation to better serve their students, LLCC will be positioned to share best practices and data regarding participation and completion to both state and national organizations. Deployed military can use the CBE program to build upon their current knowledge and complete the program entirely off campus as a result of virtual technology. Since LLCC serves a large rural population, this competency-based program will address the barriers faced by rural students wishing to participate in opportunities related to this vital science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) field. 

The project objectives are to provide an alternative delivery model for attaining a cybersecurity certificate by: 1) developing curriculum based on competency driven assessments to deliver a CBE cybersecurity certificate program, 2) developing an effective student admission process for evaluating student skills and behaviors needed to be successful in a competency-based program, 3) developing support services for students including advising, financial aid, and coaching to ensure success and completion in the program, 4) implementing the CBE cybersecurity certificate, and 5) evaluating the process and outcomes of the CBE cybersecurity certificate program. LLCC will contribute course content to the ATE Center for Systems Security and Information Assurance (CCSIA) at Moraine Community College and the ATE National CyberWatch Center at Prince George's Community College as well as adapt many of their materials for a rural audience. Completion pathways for this program will include a certificate and upon completion of the certificate the student can enter the workforce or continue their educational endeavors. The certificate is a building block to receiving an associate degree, which the student can use to transfer to a four year institution to complete a baccalaureate degree. This program will provide promising opportunities for students (both local and rural), not only at the post-secondary level, but also at the secondary level through dual credit offerings or dual enrollment at the community college.",NSF,4900,LINCOLN LAND COMMUNITY COLLEGE,5250 Shepherd Road,Springfield,US,Springfield,IL13,Lincoln Land Community College,IL,627949256,47.076,['Jeff  Mehan'],03/20/2017,071438204,199999,05/31/2020,4900,ADVANCED TECH EDUCATION PROG,199999,1700438,,Frank  Marsaglia,5250 Shepherd Road,Springfield,US,Springfield,IL13,Lincoln Land Community College,IL,627949256,frank.marsaglia@llcc.edu,Frank,Marsaglia,,2177862871,ejteles@nsf.gov,Elizabeth Teles,7032928670,040106 NSF Education & Human Resource,,,,06/01/2017,Development of a Competency-Based Education Program in CyberSecurity,Grant
404,"Software is a critical element in a wide range of real-world applications. Attacks against computer software can cause substantial damage to the cyber-infrastructure of our modern society and economy. In fact, many new software security vulnerabilities are discovered on a daily basis. Therefore, it is vital to identify and resolve those security issues as early as possible. This research aims to investigate a scientific foundation and a novel methodology for automated detection, prevention, and resolution of prior-known software security vulnerabilities in software systems. The results will help to detect and prevent prior-known security vulnerabilities from recurring in other software systems.
 
In this research, the key philosophy is that the software systems having the same/similar software security vulnerabilities share the protocols, algorithms, procedures, libraries, frameworks, modules, or source code with the same flaws, and they suffer the same/similar exploitation mechanisms. Based on that, empirical studies are conducted to investigate the nature and the characteristics of recurring software vulnerabilities in different software systems, and to validate that hypothesis. Based on the knowledge gained from the studies, new vulnerability models, representations, and similarity measurements are developed to capture recurring software security vulnerabilities, and the corresponding vulnerable code and exploitation mechanisms. Novel algorithms and techniques are designed to (semi-)automatically build graph-based vulnerability models from vulnerability reports and from vulnerable code and patches, aiming to construct a database of prior-known vulnerabilities. A new methodology is developed to help to identify the prior-known vulnerabilities in other systems and to suggest the resolution. Specifically, the automated methods and advances include 1) an algorithm to compare and match against vulnerability models in the database, 2) a technique to map software concepts between security reports and from a report to the corresponding source code fragments, modules, or components; 3) an algorithm to determine the modules and source file locations in the new system that correspond to the vulnerable modules and locations in a system with a prior-known vulnerability; and 4) a technique to suggest the patch to the new system from the prior fixes. In brief, the results of this research help to resolve early software security vulnerabilities. They will lead to more reliable software because the process of detecting and patching for recurring security vulnerabilities will be more efficient and effective.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT DALLAS,"800 W.

405,"Since November 2015 the Ocean Observatory Initiative (OOI) high-definition camera (CamHD) has been collection video clips of the deep water hydrothermal vent on the Juan de Fuca Ridge located off the coasts of the state of Washington. The CamHD is being used to study the change of the vent over time and flow of fluids. Scientists hope to use the time-series images to study animal behavior and changes in animal and microbial colonization associated with changes in fluid flow, temperature and chemistry in response to seismic and volcanic events. The data is all publicly available but the huge size of the archive and the lack of tools for easy retrieval make it difficult for investigators to take advantage of this unique data set. With this project the PIs hope to demonstrate the scientific value of the OOI CamHD system by providing tools to provide better access to the video data. This project has the potential to enable the scientific investigations in biological, geological, and oceanographic investigations that are yet to be imagined. This project will support two early-career scientists engaging in an interdisciplinary effort to add substantial value to this community resource.

At the time of the writing of this proposal some 33 TB data from the OOI seafloor high-definition camera (CamHD) has been collected and archived. The data is all publicly available but the huge size of the archive and the lack of tools for easy retrieval make it difficult for investigators to take advantage of this unique data set.

Binkley,7032928581,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The NSF-Funded Ocean Obsearvatories Initiative Cabled Array (OOI CA) provides an unprecedented level of power and bandwidth for exploration of the deep ocean.    The always-on connectivity provided by the cable enables new types of ocean instrumentation, such as the High Definition camera (CamHD) installed in the Ashes hydrothermal vent field, 1500m below the ocean's surface.  Eight times a day, CamHD broadcasts a live stream of the life and geology of Mushroom, a ~2m tall hydrothermal chimney formed by hot, mineral-laden water emerging from the seafloor.   Each time it broadcasts, CamHD looks over the entire western side of Mushroom, zooming in at a number of key locations to observe the vent in detail.

In addition to the live stream, each broadcast is archived in the OOI Cyber-Infrastructure (CI) as both a high-definition and a compressed (lossy) video. Due to the size and number of these files, it would be time consuming and expensive for an individual researcher to download and store the entire video time series.

This project supported the development of three software tools for accelerating the analysis of the archived CamHD video.   The first is a tool for retrieving individual frames from the HD video files hosted at the OOI CI without having to download the full video files.   This tool is designed as a web microservice, making it simple to retrieve individual frames from any web browser, or to build tools using any programming language with an HTTP client library.

The second tool runs motion and image analysis algorithms on every CamHD video, identifying time periods during which the camera is pointed at known sites on Mushroom vent.   Since the camera runs a pre-programmed sequence, it views the same sections of the vent during every video, however, there's no reliable record of when the camera is looking at each site. Due to small variations in timing, particlar camera positions don't necessarily occur at the same time within each movie.

This analysis occurs in two stages.   For each video, an optical-flow algorithm is used to estimate the camera motion throughout the video and to identify time ranges where the camera is not moving (static regions).    A second pass is used to label each static region with a scene identification tag by comparison with a set of manually-labelled ground truth files.  The end result is a list of timeframes within each video where the camera is still, each labelled with a scene ID which is consistent across all videos.

The ID can be used to find and isolate video subsets or still images in all labelled CamHD videos which show the same location on Mushroom.    For example, this allows creation of time-lapse videos showing the long-term evolution of hydrothermal structures on Mushroom, and it is also a precursor for further automated analyses of CamHD video.

This meta-record of labelled static scenes is published publicly (https://github.com/CamHD-Analysis/CamHD_motion_metadata) along with documentation on its calculation and a simple Python library for accessing video frames based on the meta-record.

The third component was the development of tools for accelerating the analysis of CamHD video files on both private and public cloud resources.  Analyzing a single CamHD video requires about an hour on a high-end desktop computer, but the processing of each video is independent of the other videos.  However, the project faced a multi-year / 50+TB backlog of CamHD video files and a continuous stream of new files arriving every day.   To clear this backlog, large numbers of virtual servers were ""rented"" from the Google Cloud Platform over a period of approx. three months, allowing high-throughput processing of the entire CamHD archive.  Once the backlog was cleared, ongoing processing of new CamHD files is handled to a smaller cluster of physical machines.   The capacity to inexpensively leverage massive, temporary compute assets will be essential to performing any future cross-archive analysis.

Work derived from this project was presented in a number of venues, including the 2016 and 2017 AGU general meetings, the 2018 AGU Ocean Sciences Meeting, the 2017 NOAA Ocean Exploration Forum, and the 2016 and 2017 IEEE/MTS Oceans conference.   It was also used for a tutorial/demonstration at the 2018 Cabled Array Hackweek held at the Unviersity of Washington.

406,"How fast do microbes adapt? While this question has been explored in well-mixed populations with great effort and quantitative success, there is a large gap between theory and experiments for natural populations exhibiting spatial structure. This leaves us at a serious loss in understanding the evolutionary response of, e.g., microbial colonies or biofilms, and makes it impossible to predict the pace of drug-resistance evolution. The P.I. has demonstrated in his past research that theory and experiments can be joined effectively to dissect the evolutionary processes induced by spatial structure. This effprt puts this work onto a new level by the use of innovative experimental designs such as engineered microbial systems to track the spontaneous emergence of selectable mutant clones, and theoretical concepts that allow dealing with fluctuations and eco-evolutionary feedbacks exactly. The results of this project will advance our understanding of spatio-temporal aspects of adaptation, and elucidate specifically how populations respond to environmental deterioration, which is key to efforts ranging from the rational design of strategies to conserve species in the face of environmental change to mitigating drug resistance evolution. The data set generated by this experimental research, combined with novel theory and simulations, will allow the community to reassess established paradigms about adaptation of microbial populations. The research will invite novel interdisciplinary activities in the quest to understand, predict and control adaptation of spatially-structured microbial populations. The interdisciplinary research is closely orchestrated with broad educational efforts designed to promote crossing of traditional disciplinary boundaries to achieve new ways of thinking about evolutionary processes, such as drug resistance evolution, that transcend the limitations of the standard mean-field theories of evolution. At the graduate and undergraduate level, the research will be accompanied by a new interdisciplinary course, Statistical Biophysics of Cells and Populations, that the PI offers to students of physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics. In addition, the PI has established a firm collaboration with the Lawrence Hall of Science at Berkeley to prepare novel educational resources for high-school students and undergraduates to explore the ubiquity and evolutionary potential of microbial populations and to establish the crucial link between ecology and evolution. These resources, which include a learning module and hands-on activities, will be documented in write-ups and made freely available online through existing NSF-funded cyber-infrastructure platforms.

Demography and evolution are tightly intertwined. The distribution of individuals in space determines the influx of new mutations, the strength of genetic drift and the competition between genotypes. Evolution on the other hand, influences the sizes and densities populations can attain, how individuals migrate and interact with each other and the environment and how they reproduce and die. The feedback between population dynamics and evolution is absent in standard models of evolving well-mixed populations. Yet, it constrains the pace of adaptation, the predictability of evolutionary outcomes and the evolutionary response of spatially-structured populations. The objective of this project is to fill this gap by quantifying the associated eco-evolutionary feedback in microbial populations and its consequences for adaptation. To this end, the P.I. proposes tightly-controlled microbial evolution experiments to quantify how population dynamics alters patterns of molecular evolution, and new population genetics theory that bridges the gap in spatio-temporal scales between laboratory experiments and natural populations. The specific aims are: 1. Determine how the stochastic dynamics of how cells generate population-level patterns of genetic drift and selection and how these patterns control the fate of beneficial mutations. Generalize well-established theories of evolution in well-mixed populations to capture the eco-evolutionary feedback dynamics of the experiments. 2. Determine how spatially-structured populations adapt to environmental challenges (i) via pre-existing mutations and (ii) via the accumulation of new mutations. 3. Establish a new course, a workshop on unintentional biases and undergraduate mentoring to increase diversity in the STEM fields at UC Berkeley.

407,"Tyler Luchko of California State University, Northridge, is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational methods program in the Chemistry division to develop methods for large-scale molecular simulations.  The Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&E) Program in the Division of Advanced Cyber Infrastructure contributes to the award.  Computational modeling is frequently used to understand interactions between proteins, DNA, and a wide variety of small molecules at the molecular level. The use of computational methods has lead to advances in our understanding of fundamental biology and to the design of new molecules, such as anti-viral medications. However, realistic computer simulations require accurate models of the water environment that supports these interactions. Models that consider the position of every molecule of water are physically accurate but the computation time required quickly becomes prohibitive as the number of molecules grows. Other methods replace the molecular detail of water and are much faster, but at the cost of accuracy. The 3D reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) is a third approach that avoids following the atomic positions of water by calculating the density distribution of water molecules. 3D-RISM has already been successfully used to study biological problems, such as the salt and water distribution around DNA and the binding of small molecules to proteins. This project aims to improve 3D-RISM by further developing the theory to better capture the pressure and density distribution of molecular water and apply advanced numerical methods to make these calculations faster.  Luchko and co-workers target problems that cover multiple length scales, such as the self-assembly of structures within the cell. Advances in 3D-RISM theory are distributed with the AmberTools molecular modeling suite, allowing free access to these methods for the broader research community. Undergraduates and Master's level students are involved in this research. 

The focus of this project is to develop three independent but complementary approaches to increase the detail and accuracy of large-scale simulations to enable molecular simulations that are not currently possible. Improving the underlying theory of 3D-RISM provides the accuracy of atomistic solvent models without explicitly simulating them. This allows crystal structure refinement and solvent distributions around DNA to be determined using atomistic solvent models at a fraction of the computational cost presently required. Increasing computational efficiency one to two orders of magnitude brings the existing atomistic detail of 3D-RISM to biomolecules consisting of millions of atoms for the first time. The new end-state free energy method capitalizes on recent developments for and unique features of 3D-RISM, bringing faster, easier and more accurate free energy calculations to systems of multiple scales. Combined, these advances improve the accuracy of all solvent properties, decrease calculation time by one to two orders of magnitude and improve binding free energy predictions for large systems. These improvements are significant because they drastically increase the scope and scale of biophysical problems that atomistic molecular modeling can address.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY CORPORATION, THE",18111 Nordhoff Street,Northridge,US,Northridge,CA30,"The University Corporation, Northridge",CA,913308309,47.049,,07/14/2016,055752331,374867,06/30/2019,4900,"Theory, Models, Comput.

408,"A great challenge in astrophysics is to understand in detail how the initial smooth distribution of matter in the early Universe formed the first galaxies.  Complementing observations of real galaxies, researchers use computational simulations to model the early Universe and study the results.  This process allows one to learn how these first galaxies might have formed.  However, the sheer size and complexity of such galaxy simulations present their own challenge as a single research group lacks the capacity to explore them fully.  As a result, maximizing the scientific value of simulations demands new tools and services designed to foster the growth of a collaborative, multi-group research community.  This project aims to develop and use a new virtual laboratory to enable transformative scientific inquiry on new and existing galaxy simulations, some of which were produced by prior NSF support.  Enabling public access and unrestricted analysis and fostering a collaborative environment for sharing technology and results will ensure that galaxy simulations continue to be valuable within and beyond the research group that originally conducted them.  This project addresses the national imperative to develop US cyber infrastructure and to develop US leadership in scientific research in astrophysics.

More technically, with prior NSF support the investigators used the Blue Waters supercomputer at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) to perform the Renaissance Simulations: among the largest, most detailed simulations of the formation and evolution of the first galaxies to date.  The Renaissance Simulations yielded a sample of over 3,000 high redshift (20 > z > 7) galaxies and were specifically designed to simulate the dominant sources responsible for preheating the intergalactic medium and reionization at an unprecedented level of detail.  This project plans two related activities: (1) further analysis of the Renaissance Simulations; and (2) the creation of an open-data access portal, the Renaissance Simulation Laboratory (RSL), which will provide open access to this unique data corpus along with associated data analysis tools for the astronomical research community.  Driving its design and utility, the investigators will use the RSL to carry out their own research investigations.  The investigators' research processes will become part of the RSL in the form of executable ""Jupyter"" notebooks.  The Jupyter Notebook, an evolution of the iPython Notebook, is a fundamental part of the RSL and is ushering in the era of open science.  The investigators' use of Docker containers is equally compelling.  By containerizing Jupyter Notebooks which execute pre-programmed data analysis workflows the investigators are able to bring computation to the data and share how they obtain their scientific results, a key step toward reproducible science.

409,"Globular star clusters are among the oldest objects in our Universe, and understanding their origin has remained a great challenge to astrophysicists for many decades.  This project will develop computer software employing a new numerical method to perform the calculations modeling the formation of these clusters of stars.  This new computer software will enable better computer modeling of the astrophysics governing a variety of physical applications.  It will also be the first such software to be made publicly available.  The investigators will then use this software to create computer simulations that model the formation of globular star clusters, and they specifically seek to understand the apparent creation of multiple generations of stars in these globular clusters.  This project's goals will advance the national interests of developing US leadership in physics and enhancing the US cyber infrastructure.  In addition, the investigators will address the national underrepresentation of minorities in the sciences by funding a graduate student to participate in Columbia University's Bridge to the PhD in the Natural Sciences program.  The investigators will train the student in the research program and will mentor the student through the early stages of his or her science career.

More technically, the first part of this project lays out a systematic plan to develop a new open source moving-mesh code.  Recent development of the moving-mesh method as a viable alternative to smoothed particle hydrodynamics and adaptive mesh refinement is a promising development.  Moving-mesh hydrodynamics brings many desirable features including low-diffusion in bulk flows, Galilean invariance, and good shock handling.  The software development uses modern design and coding techniques to produce an efficient, parallel code that will be capable of using a wide range of physics and that is easy to use and modify.  It will use the widely used Python language combined with Cython (a static Python compiler) in computationally intensive parts.  Coding will be modular and designed to allow easy and flexible extension to all parts of the code.  The second part of this project is to simulate the formation of globular clusters.  The code will be applied to a three-part plan for understanding globular cluster formation:  (1) modeling the fragmentation and collapse of idealized low-metallicity gas clouds to understand the relative importance of global collapse and fragmentation; (2) using cosmological simulations to identify the physical properties of gas undergoing rapid colliding flows, a prerequisite to bring together a large amount of gas in a small region for GC formation; and (3) exploring the ability of gas outflows from the proposed sources of enriched material to be re-incorporated into a second generation of stars.",NSF,4900,"TRUSTEES OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK, THE",2960 Broadway,NEW YORK,US,New York,NY10,Columbia University,NY,100276902,47.049,,07/07/2016,049179401,406729,09/30/2019,4900,EXTRAGALACTIC ASTRON & COSMOLO,406729,1615955,049179401,Greg L Bryan,2960 Broadway,New York,US,New York,NY10,Columbia University,NY,100276902,gbryan@astro.columbia.edu,Greg,Bryan,L,2128546837,eajhar@nsf.gov,Edward Ajhar,7032927456,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,,10/01/2016,CDS&E: The development of open-source software with an application to modeling the formation of globular star clusters,Grant
410,"A great challenge in astrophysics is to understand in detail how the initial smooth distribution of matter in the early Universe formed the first galaxies.  Complementing observations of real galaxies, researchers use computational simulations to model the early Universe and study the results.  This process allows one to learn how these first galaxies might have formed.  However, the sheer size and complexity of such galaxy simulations present their own challenge as a single research group lacks the capacity to explore them fully.  As a result, maximizing the scientific value of simulations demands new tools and services designed to foster the growth of a collaborative, multi-group research community.  This project aims to develop and use a new virtual laboratory to enable transformative scientific inquiry on new and existing galaxy simulations, some of which were produced by prior NSF support.  Enabling public access and unrestricted analysis and fostering a collaborative environment for sharing technology and results will ensure that galaxy simulations continue to be valuable within and beyond the research group that originally conducted them.  This project addresses the national imperative to develop US cyber infrastructure and to develop US leadership in scientific research in astrophysics.

More technically, with prior NSF support the investigators used the Blue Waters supercomputer at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) to perform the Renaissance Simulations: among the largest, most detailed simulations of the formation and evolution of the first galaxies to date.  The Renaissance Simulations yielded a sample of over 3,000 high redshift (20 > z > 7) galaxies and were specifically designed to simulate the dominant sources responsible for preheating the intergalactic medium and reionization at an unprecedented level of detail.  This project plans two related activities: (1) further analysis of the Renaissance Simulations; and (2) the creation of an open-data access portal, the Renaissance Simulation Laboratory (RSL), which will provide open access to this unique data corpus along with associated data analysis tools for the astronomical research community.  Driving its design and utility, the investigators will use the RSL to carry out their own research investigations.  The investigators' research processes will become part of the RSL in the form of executable ""Jupyter"" notebooks.  The Jupyter Notebook, an evolution of the iPython Notebook, is a fundamental part of the RSL and is ushering in the era of open science.  The investigators' use of Docker containers is equally compelling.  By containerizing Jupyter Notebooks which execute pre-programmed data analysis workflows the investigators are able to bring computation to the data and share how they obtain their scientific results, a key step toward reproducible science.

Non-Technical Abstract

The field of atomistic scale materials modeling makes use of sophisticated theories based on quantum mechanics, called Density Functional Theory or DFT for short, that are implemented in computationally efficient software that are, nonetheless, computationally intensive.   This project makes use of a new and emerging methodology called Materials Informatics that is able to detect and extract structure-property correlations by exploring the statistical nature of data without necessarily utilizing pre-existing theoretical formulas. In this project materials informatics is used  to identify new materials with optimum properties for high-temperature electronic devices without having to carry out  calculations for every possible material structure and composition. The tools developed  will be made broadly available through a cyberinfrastructure platform, we term a ""Materials Data Foundry"". This web portal will also facilitate joint online courses between Iowa State University (ISU) and the University of Florida (UF), where the students use the tools developed in the project to analyze real data and problems. At UF, outreach will be focused on high school students through the UF Student Science Training Program while at ISU we will leverage the Iowa EPSCoR program to have access to a national network of community and Tribal Colleges. Our plan is use the educational capabilities of the Materials Data Foundry to connect with teachers who in turn will reach hundreds of students over the course of this project.",NSF,4900,"RESEARCH FOUNDATION FOR THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK, THE",520 Lee Entrance,Amherst,US,Buffalo,NY26,SUNY at Buffalo,NY,142282567,47.049,,02/29/2016,038633251,125206,08/31/2017,4900,Comp&Data Driven Mat Res(CDMR),125206,1623838,020657151,Krishna  Rajan,,Buffalo,US,Buffalo,NY26,SUNY at Buffalo,NY,142607016,krajan3@buffalo.edu,Krishna,Rajan,,7166451380,dhess@nsf.gov,Daryl W. Hess,7032924942,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"This project established a new approach for materials simulation and modeling that linked informatics methods to Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.  The discovery of new chemistries of (i) perovskites, (ii) M2AX compounds, and (iii) Co- and Ni-Base Superalloys served as the template for this project.  By designing across multiple platforms, we were able to demonstrate the generic nature of the approach developed.  We developed statistical learning and graph theoretic methodologies to discover patterns of behavior among known materials that were used to generate design rules for identifying structure-property relationships in new compounds; and which serve to guide and target DFT calculations to specific chemistries with the desired properties. Specifically, the project developed a rule-based design approach based on informatics which identified new chemistries for each of the respective material classes.  Through the inclusion of informatics approaches, this project explored the vast chemical space which is so large that it would otherwise have been prohibitive to study by solely experimental and/or computational methods.  

This project developed statistical learning methodologies to discover patterns of behavior among known materials that could then be used to generate design rules for identifying structure-property relationships in new compounds, and which will serve to guide and target data intensive calculations to specific chemistries with the desired properties.  DFT calculations are highly accurate and typically are implemented in efficient software.  However, they still remain computationally intensive, as well as requiring some initial energetic description of the material.  We used Materials Informatics to detect and extract structure-property correlations by exploring the statistical nature of data without utilizing pre-existing theoretical formulas.  In this way, we shifted the DFT approach from one of seeking for materials to one of designing materials.

The intellectual impact of this work was to transform the traditional use of computational materials science from one of building large data repositories where informatics is primarily used as a search engine for compounds, to one where data science methods were used as a learning engine to uncover new physics and suggest new directions for conducting detailed computations on promising chemistries that would otherwise remain unidentified.  The following activities addressed this objective:

1)      Development of new informatics driven high-throughput analyses for the development of multi-functional property databases of M2AX phases based on identification of the key elemental characteristics and quantifying their collective impact on material properties.  This provided a framework for developing large ?virtual? material databases.

2)      Discovery of chemical site occupancy-electronic structure-elastic constant correlations.  Through data mining density of states spectra derived from the DFT component of this collaborative project, we developed new design rules for computational design of Ni-base superalloys with targeted properties.

3)      Through linking machine learning approaches for extracting critical information from graphs, images, and tables, we identified 15 previously undiscovered binary metallic glass forming hosts.  By assessing the large amount of thermodynamic data existing and integrating this data with our knowledge base developed in this project, we have introduced a new framework for materials design integrating electronic structure, crystal structure, thermodynamics, and mechanical properties.

The broader impact of this work was accomplished through the new Department of Materials Design and Innovation (MDI) at the University at Buffalo (UB).  The tools and data from this project have been incorporated into the curriculum, particularly in the form of case studies and projects for the students. For example, the informatics tools have been leveraged in the MDI course ""Multivariate Statistics and Material Informatics"" where the students propose new materials using the informatics tools from this project, while multiple case studies and problem sets are focused on linking electronic structure calculations with informatics in the course ""Computational Materials Chemistry and Physics"". All students completing a degree in this department understand the informatics approaches, the issues associated with data and databases, and the fundamentals of electronic structure calculations.  Further, through the new department, we had extensive outreach platforms, specifically through the hosting of the inaugural MDI Symposium and the involvement in the Eric Pitman Annual Summer Workshop in Computational Science for high school students.

412,"Angela Wilson, of the University of North Texas, is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division and the Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering Program (CDS&E) to develop a group of accurate, efficient, and easily usable quantum mechanical computational approaches to study the heavy elements, those elements at the bottom of the periodic table.  The Division of Advanced Cyber Infrastructure contributes funding for this award.  The need for environmental sustainability offers both opportunities and challenges for computational chemistry research.  Examples of problems that need to be addressed are the design of environmentally benign materials and processes, the development of alternative or renewable energy sources, the design of new, more efficient catalysts and the replacement of often expensive critical resources that are in short-supply.   To address these major scientific challenges, information regarding the relative energies of molecular species is often critical for the rational analysis and design of molecular species and materials. However, one of the long-standing challenges in computational chemistry is in achieving chemically accurate energetics, due to the extensive computational requirements (computer time, memory, and disk space) of the methods required, severely limiting the size of molecules that can be studied routinely with high accuracy. The challenges become even more substantial for heavy elements, where the evolution of practical, high accuracy approaches has been much less developed. The computational tools that the Wilson group develops are designed lead to new, more accessible, and improved chemical predictions.  The software and data base implemented in this project will be widely available to the research community.

In this project, Wilson and her research group have the following goals:  (1)  Developing ab initio composite schemes tailored for 4f species, whose chemistry has received increasing scrutiny due to sustainability concerns.  The composite schemes are being implemented within freely available computational chemistry software packages to enable dissemination to the broader scientific community. (2) Developing and utilizing databases for gauging theoretical methodologies for the transition metals.  These datasets and databases will be made available publicly.

Graphite in lead pencils is an example of a layered material. In this work, we examined carbide and nitride materials called MAX materials that can exist in a layered form, called MXenes.

We also developed computer software that can be used to search databases to identify new material combinations that can be made to exist in layered form.

Software developed by this project has been widely disseminated as open source code. Many SSL/TLS developers, including those at Mozilla, have started using the frankencerts methodology for testing their SSL/TLS code. The NoFrak access-control mechanism for hybrid Web/mobile application development frameworks has been integrated into the open-source Apache Cordova project (under the name SecureToken), which provides the core functionality for dozens of thousands of mobile apps and is running on millions of Android phones. Our access-control methodology for preventing untrusted advertisements from inferring sensitive information about mobile users has been adopted by all major Android mobile advertising libraries.

The project supported multiple PhD students, all of whom have gone on successful careers in computer security and privacy research.  Two are tenure-track assistant professors, at Columbia University and KAIST, respectively; two are working as security engineers at Google and Yelp, respectively.

417,"Modern research is increasingly data-based, whether the endeavor is in the physical, biological, or social sciences. Increasingly that research calls for large amounts of data to be transferred, modified, synced, and reliably stored for both the short and long term. The remarkable increase in both the generation and use of digital data and data tools has left many researchers behind.  The primary mission of the CyberInfrastructure Engineer (CIE) is to significantly engage in the interaction between researcher and technology via personal support and consultation, and to teach introductory classes on selected topics, with a net goal of bringing useful technologies to more researchers.

The CIE is working to improve the data-driven nature of scientific research in three parallel avenues: 1) data safety through the deployment of automated systems to move large scale research data to off-site systems; 2) data transfer through the use of state-of-the-art tools and systems currently unknown to many researchers; and, 3) data performance by expanded use of the highest-performance storage, retrieval, and processing of very large datasets.  UCI is evaluating a number of competing designs and services for a large-scale campus storage pool, creating a hybrid backup system that caches data locally before sending it on via our NSF-funded Science DMZ (UCI-LightPath) to longer-term, less-expensive, Cloud backup systems, and automating and using existing high speed data transfer protocols to be much easier for researchers to take advantage of.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE","141 Innovation Drive, Ste 250",Irvine,US,Irvine,CA45,University of California-Irvine,CA,926173213,47.070,,08/26/2015,046705849,398046,08/31/2018,4900,Campus Cyberinfrastrc (CC-NIE),398046,1541393,071549000,Dana F Roode,,,US,Irvine,CA45,University of California-Irvine,CA,926972700,dana.roode@uci.edu,Dana,Roode,F,9498245173,kthompso@nsf.gov,Kevin L. Thompson,7032928970,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The main goal of this project was to provide a 'Cyber Infrastructure Engineer' (CIE) to support projects at UCI such as the NSF-sponsored 'LightPath' research network and related CI projects that involve a wide segment of campus researchers.  

The project was successful and contributed to UC Irvine's effort to expand and enhance campus Research CyberInfrastructure.  The CIE has now been funded as a permanent member of UCI's RCI Center which was established with this goal through support of UCI's Provost, Vice Chancellor for Research, and Chief Information Officer.  The establishment of the RCIC was proposed as an outcome of UCI's 2016 RCI Vision initiative (sites.uci.edu/rci).

The CIE will continue and expand support efforts in the areas of large-scale research data transfer and associated computing and storage services.  The CIE has also supported other campus and UC-wide CI (and NSF supported) initiatives such as the Pacific Research Platform.

Six tasks were defined for the project after the hiring and training of the CIE:

1) To support campus users with their use of the 'LightPath' research network, specifically to assist and optimize their large-scale data transfer efforts;

2) To test and plan for the creation of a large-scale campus data storage system (the Campus Research Storage Pool) akin to Purdue's DataDepot;

3) To test and plan for a disk backup system from CRSP to Amazon's Glacier system;

4) To test and develop a research group level 'Owncloud'-based storage system for data sharing and collaboration;

5) To teach and train UCI students and researchers on 'BigData' data transfer and analytic teaching in coordination with the UCI Data Science Initiative, and

6) Develop a 'cloud bursting' service from a future computing cluster to Amazon AWS services in support of campus researchers requiring more computing resources than possible using on-premise clusters.

The project was successful on all the key aspects of these tasks.  Significant progress was made to allow the further development of the CRSP storage system and the upcoming ?HPC3? research computing cluster.  At the same time, many UCI research groups were directly supported in their CI efforts.  In particular the Biology and Genome High Throughput Facility, the Center for Hydrometerology and Remote Sensing, the Arianna Collaboration, and the CERN/Atlas project. Training of UCI research students occurred both through Data Science tutorials and events as well as continual on-on-one interactions with the CIE during the granting period.

Among the research products of the project are Github websites containing the programmatic tools created during the project along with support documentation.  The CIE was a continuing contributor to the NSF CIE community though the CI Engineering Brown Bag program run by Jason Zurawski.

In summary, the CIE project at UCI was successful in supporting new research CI efforts and projects on campus.  The high level of success of the program can be seen by the choice by campus research management to continue the position with permanent staffing.  A wide range of campus research groups made excellent use of the services provided by the CIE.  At the same time, the development work of the CIE will allow UCI to deploy several new CI services and systems that will be crucial to large segments of the campus research community.

418,"Researchers from the University of Alabama-Huntsville and their NCAR collaborators will convene a workshop in Boulder Colorado to define issues and to share research and ideas relevant to the role that migration of agriculture might play in sustaining production and how the geography of sustainable production might be defined in terms of food, energy, and water nexus systems.  The primary outcome from the workshop will be a short report that summarizes primary research needs and potential approaches.

The geography of agricultural production in the U.S. changed dramatically in the last century with substantial food and fiber shifting to the arid west under irrigation and grain production becoming concentrated in the upper Midwest. The question is whether this paradigm of  the last century is sustainable and reliable for the future. Can some portion of the production in the West now under water stress be migrated back to the East under irrigation? Can some production in the Southwest migrate to the Northwest where water is more plentiful? Can grain production be more geographically distributed to avoid the environmental issues (e.g. nutrient run-off) and vulnerability to small regional droughts that the present concentration of production entails? This geography of agricultural production has also changed energy consumption through electrical energy used to move surface water in the West and to pump water in the High Plains. It has created the need for transportation energy to move refrigerated food from the West to the East and grains from the Midwest to the Southeast for consumption by poultry and swine. On the other hand, a new migration of agriculture back to the Southeast may see competition for water for cooling in thermoelectric generation and hydroelectric losses. This workshop will bring together hydrologists, agronomists, economists, climatologists, ecologists, energy experts, and water resource planners to discuss the vulnerabilities of the present geography of agriculture and discuss whether a new migration of agriculture might sustain production in the coming century.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN HUNTSVILLE, THE",301 Sparkman Drive,Huntsville,US,Huntsville,AL05,University of Alabama in Huntsville,AL,358051911,47.050,"['James F Cruise', 'Maurice  Estes Jr.']",06/25/2015,949687123,56335,06/30/2018,4900,HYDROLOGIC SCIENCES,56335,1541799,808245794,Richard  McNider,320 Sparkman Drive,,US,Huntsville,AL05,University of Alabama in Huntsville,AL,358051911,mcnider@nsstc.uah.edu,Richard,McNider,,2569617756,hbarnard@nsf.gov,Holly Barnard,7032928549,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"In the last century the geography of the Nation?s agricultural production changed dramatically as food and fiber production shifted from the East to the arid West under irrigated agriculture. Similarly, as transportation improved corn and grain production migrated to deep water holding soils in a small area of the upper Midwest.  As a result agriculture in the East dropped precipitously. In a positive sense, this migration of agriculture produced a bountiful fare of food at a price afforded by ordinary Americans.  However, the present drought in the West and the 2012 Midwest drought perhaps expose the vulnerability of the new geography of U.S. agriculture. Additionally, the shift in agriculture brought about adverse impacts on river ecosystems in the West and the concentration of nutrient export to the Mississippi River. This leads to several strategic questions.  Is the geography that evolved in the last century, due to immediate market forces and government investments, sustainable and reliable for the future?  Will the geography of agriculture continue to evolve and, if so, can information be developed that can guide future migrations of agriculture.  The East lost its agriculture in large part because of drought losses so bringing agriculture back to the East will require expanded irrigation. Can some portion of the production in the West now under water stress due to increasing demand from population growth and potential reduction in supply from climate change be migrated back to the East or Northwest under irrigation? Can grain production be more geographically distributed to avoid the environmental issues (e.g. nutrient run-off) and vulnerability to small regional droughts that the present concentration of grain production in such a small area entails? This new geography of agricultural production has also changed energy consumption through electrical energy used to move water surface water in the West and to pump water in the High Plains. It has created the need for transportation energy to move refrigerated food from the West to the East and grains from the Midwest to the Southeast for consumption by poultry and swine. While transportation energy is generally a small part of total energy in food production it can, however, have large impacts on final profit. A new migration of agriculture back to the Southeast may see competition for water for cooling in thermoelectric generation and hydroelectric losses. Thus, the sustainable geography for U.S. agricultural production is at the nexus of food energy and water interactions.

 

An NSF Workshop was convened in Boulder, Colorado October 21-23, 2015 that brought together hydrologists, agronomists, economists, climatologists, ecologists, energy experts, and water resource planners to discuss the vulnerabilities of the present geography of agriculture. The workshop discussed whether information might be developed to assess the geography of economic and agricultural sustainability in the future that might guide private sector investments and government policy as needed to sustain production in the coming century.  Data mining and cyber infrastructure components such as software tools and models were introduced at the beginning of the workshop as critical parts needed to meet information gathering needs for informed decisions.  The workshop began the process of determining how the geography of sustainable production might be defined in terms of food, energy, and water metrics. 

Intellectual Merit: The main intellectual challenge in this activity is defining appropriate geographic food, energy and water metrics related to sustainability and actually computing these metrics. A key factor is maintaining a broad outlook that can be quantified.  The intellectual challenge is also to bring together separate suites of models and the data needed to exercise the models and produce information of actual use to real stakeholders and policy officials.

Broader Impacts: This activity explores a new path for realizing sustainability of food and energy.  It is expected that the coupled water demand and hydrologic models developed here can be used as water management tools in the Southeast. The tools and analysis presented here should also be of use in other parts of the world to show that irrigation in areas where water is plentiful may be a path to increased production that is more sustainable than desert irrigation. The old abandoned agricultural lands in the Southeast are some of the poorest in the nation. Resurrecting grain production can potentially revitalize these rural economies and reduce government transfers which now dominate the economy.

 

A complete Workshop Report and a White Paper describing potential paths to defining geographical sustainability were the outcomes of the Workshop. These can be found at the Workshop Website https://www.nsstc.uah.edu/few.workshop/index.html

Geosciences representatives brought requirements from Earth, ocean, polar, and geospace sciences. Participants from intelligent systems represented fields such as information integration, machine learning, knowledge representation, semantics and metadata, geospatial computing, robotics, visualization, and augmented reality. The workshop built on the momentum of the NSF EarthCube initiative for geosciences and was informed by ongoing cyberinfrastructure efforts. 

Many aspects of geosciences research pose novel problems for intelligent systems research. Geoscience data is interesting to computer scientists because it tends to be uncertain, intermittent, sparse, multi-resolution, and multi-scale. Geosciences processes and objects often have amorphous spatio-temporal boundaries. The lack of ground truth makes model evaluation, testing, and comparison difficult.  Overcoming these challenges would greatly benefit the geosciences and would require breakthroughs in intelligent systems.

Workshop participants agreed that in order to address these challenges new research is required in intelligent and information systems, including:

Knowledge representation: Capturing scientific knowledge to represent our understanding of geoscience processes will push the limits of the state of the art.
Sensing and robotics: New data collection capabilities that leverage scientific knowledge for optimized data collection and adaptive sampling. 
Information integration: Geosciences data and models need to be interconnected and easy to manipulate in an integrated system of systems.  
Machine learning: Algorithms need to identify and incorporate appropriate constraints as required by the governing geosciences processes.  
Intelligent user interfaces: Interactions must be guided by the geoscience questions that provide context for the content to be conveyed. 


All these areas cannot be investigated separately as they are interdependent.  For example, improvements in sensing will facilitate learning, deeper representations of data will facilitate information integration, and richer learning algorithms will lead to better interfaces.

Recommendations from the workshop include: 1) Interdisciplinary community building through sustained multi-year collaborations; 2) Educating and building awareness of computer scientists and geoscientists in each otherÆs fields, and 3) Establishing direct partnerships between intelligent systems and geoscience researchers. Participants noted that these activities will result in innovations in both intelligent systems and geosciences.

World class researchers will participate in his meeting.

Research activities in turbulence involve the collection of massive amounts of data from multi-scale computer simulations and/or large-scale experiments. For example, highly non-linear time dependent stochastic turbulent flow experiments routinely produce terabytes of multi-modal data (velocity, pressure, temperature, acoustics, etc.) in fractions of a second. Such computational and experimental research presents formidable big data challenges and overcoming them is indeed critical for achieving real breakthroughs.

The project provided funding for the purchase of the computing cluster only. The process of specifying, purchasing, and installing the cluster took several iterations between the PI Z. Aksamija and the Office of Information Technology at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. They served as liaison between the PI and the vendor and also coordinated the installation of the cluster in the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC) in Holyoke, MA. 

The MGHPCC is a shared facility supported and used by the 5 leading schools in the New England area with over 200K ft^2 of space powered by green energy from the nearby (&lt;1 mile) hydro power plant on the Connecticut river. The UMass model allows faculty to purchase agreements to gain priority access to part of the hardware with free technical support by the university Office of Information Technology.

The actual cluster (or the portion for which the Research Starter/this proposal provided) contains a total of 6 blades in a Dell PowerEdge 1000e rack. Each blade contains 2 Intel CPUs with 10 cores per CPU, totaling 120 cores. The cluster also includes dedicated storage (10TB).  The cluster was finalized and made available to the PI on March 15th, after the end date of the grant. However, the cluster continues to support the PI's research and accelerate time-to-discovery of novel nanostructured materials for energy applications.

Since the installation, the hardware has been in full use by my research group to study vibrational modes of semiconductor alloys (such as SiGe, and SiSn) and 2-dimensional materials (graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides). We use the code Quantum Espresso (QE) for these calculations from first principles. We use the output of QE in combination with an in-house Boltzmann solver code, which the PI Z. Aksamija developed during his postdoctoral work funded by the NSF CI TraCS fellowship (2011-2013), to study thermal transport in nanostructures made from aforementioned 3-dimensional alloys (predominantly group IV including SiGe and SiSn) and 2-dimensional materials. We are emphasizing in our work the role of extrinsic effects, such as boundaries of a nanostructure, grain boundaries in poly/nanocrystalline materials, and heterogeneous interfaces between dissimilar materials.

The research results obtained using the cluster, in the relatively short time since it was installed, show that extrinsic effects are very significant in both 2D and 3D nanostructures and dominate the transfer of heat across grain boundaries in both types of materials. This finding has potential impact on heat management in next-generation nanoelectronics but more immediately in designing more efficient solid-state thermo-electric (TE) energy converters for waste-heat scavenging from the many heat sources (car exhaust, industrial plants, etc.). The reduction of thermal conductivity we observe in group IV alloys points the way to novel TE converters which take advantage of the combination of alloy disorder and nanostructuring in the form of thin films to achieve larger TE conversion efficiency. The computing cluster funded by this award will continue to accelerate calculations of thermal and thermo-electric properties of nanostructured alloys and 2-dimensional materials for nanoelectronics and energy applications.

Specifically, SENSEI is a spherical, (ultra) high-resolution (9-times-IMAX resolution and ~terapixel/minute flood of imagery), vision-based capture system capable of video-rate data-acquisition. The instrument will address domain challenges in science, engineering, medicine, and beyond by enabling investigation of big data acquisition, streaming, processing, archiving and access, visualization, and analytics.

The broader significance of this project will be felt in a variety of image-intensive scientific disciplines. The areas of environmental monitoring, remote sensing, situational awareness, homeland security, and mechanical and structural engineering can greatly benefit from the proposed instrument. The instrument will be designed for replication by the global community of researchers and the graduate students.  The technology will be communicated through classes, projects, theses, publications, as well as museum exhibits and conferences. Special attention has been paid to broadening participation through the Minority Serving Institutions Cyber-Infrastructure Empowerment Coalition (MSI-CIEC).",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS,809 S.

Mimi McClure,7032925197,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"File systems are at the heart of all computers.  They maintain the contents of files and folders/directories, as well as metadata such as the time of last modification. File-system performance bottlenecks can reduce the overall performance of computing platforms at every scale, from smart phones to supercomputers.

Modern file systems are mostly built on top of data structures that have been around for decades.  The main thrust of this proposal was to build a new file system based on the new data structures that are fast for many file-system-critical operations.  The aim is twofold: to show that faster data structures translate into faster systems at the user level; and to show that many tradeoffs that are built into modern file systems can be overcome by radically redesigning the file system with the right data structures.

The main results are summarized in four papers, in the last four FAST conferences.  The USENIX FAST conference is the top conference for file systems.

The FAST 15 paper established the basic premise that fast data structures can indeed translate into better performance at the application level.  This paper introduced BetrFS, so named because it uses a B^e-tree to store both data and metadata.  This paper showed that data could be modified at every scale, from micro- to macro-updates, while allowing the file and directory contents to be read quickly.  Not every operation was fast in this version of BetrFS, and improving the performance of some key operations was left as future work.  This paper was one of three finalists for Best Paper award.

The FAST 16 paper showed that some of the performance problems in the FAST 15 paper were fixable.  In particular, sequential writes -- that is, writing the contents of a large file, such as when a file is downloaded -- was slower than in other file systems.  The problem was that such large files were being written twice: once as the content of a file, and once in a log file designed to make the file system secure against computer crashes.  The FAST 16 paper showed how to write the file once while still allowing the file system to remain secure against computer crashes.  Surprisingly, most file systems in use today can become corrupted if the computer crashes, so achieving both crash safety and high performance was an important advance.  This paper received the Best Paper award.

The FAST 17 paper studied the problem of file-system aging.  Many users of older Windows machines will remember that these computer required defragmentation from time to time in order to maintain performance.  Performance degradation with use is called aging.  Advances in file systems suggested in the early 2000's that file systems no longer needed defragmentation, because they were able to stay ahead of aging by the use of various heuristics.  The mathematical models used to design the data structures used in BetrFS suggested that as storage devices have more bandwidth, aging should become a worse problem.  Therefore, 15 year old studies that showed no file-system aging would be out of date.  These models also suggested that B^e-trees would not suffer from aging.  This paper introduced a simple method to age a file system.  It further showed that standard file systems can age by a factor of 20 or more -- that is, performance can drop to 5% of peak -- and that BetrFS, as predicted, does not age.  These results were surprising enough that this paper was invited for repeat presentation at two other conferences and the authors were invited to present a less technical version of the work in USENIX's magazine, login.

The upcoming FAST 18 paper fixes the seemingly intractable problem of making file systems fast to read and making directory renames fast.  The problem is that of updating path names.  The path name of a file is the string that encodes the nesting directories that contain it.  So if a file a.txt is inside a directory called b, which is inside a directory called c, then the path name of the file is /c/b/a.txt.  Keeping files in path-name order makes reading them fast, because files that are near each other in this order tend to be accessed at similar times.  On the other hand, if a directory gets moved or renamed, the path name of every file below it in the directory tree gets a new path name, which makes rename slow.  The standard solution is to introduce so-called inodes, which makes renames fast but reads slow.  This paper shows how to make both fast, by modifying the B^e-tree where the data is stored.

These four papers are only some of the work produced by this grant, but they illustrate the main arc of this research over the last few years.

427,"The objective of this project is to develop sensing, prediction, optimization, and control techniques for arrays of ocean wave energy conversion devices, known as wave farms, to make them reliable, efficient, economical, and environmentally benign.  The project focuses on operational questions about the cyber-infrastructure required to control and coordinate a wave farm's many autonomous sensing and decision-making functions.  Research topics include designing computational tools to assess real-time hydrodynamic interactions of wave energy converters; developing short-term and long-term wave prediction algorithms; using wave condition forecasts to dynamically control arrays of wave energy converters and energy storage systems within wave farms; enabling rapid fault detection tests that use wave sensor data to assess system state; and automating these decision-making processes within a wave farm with a multi-agent control system.  The project also assesses and optimizes the sustainability and electricity market potential of wave farms by quantifying the opportunities and gains that wave power producers may avail in the electricity market due to the predictability and consistency of waves, and the effect of optimal wave farm design and control on CO2 emissions.   The project includes an educational and workforce development plan to develop and administer an in-ocean course for high school students from the Lehigh Valley, PA at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences on the topic of wave energy; and to engage in community outreach via educational modules and a unique exhibit on wave energy for patrons of the Da Vinci Science Center in Allentown, PA.

If successful, the project will optimize and estimate the extent to which wave energy can provide green, predictable, dispatchable power to the electricity grid. The results will yield models, algorithms, control strategies, and system architectures to improve the output power of wave farms, reduce operating costs, maximize their environmental benefits, and provide guidance for farm operators in pursuing market opportunities. The project will validate the economic and environmental feasibility of wave power and drive forward the significant research and development efforts currently underway to bring the potential of wave energy conversion to grid-scale fruition.  Efficient and economic harvesting of the kinetic energy in ocean waves offers an electricity future with a more diverse supply portfolio, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and higher sustainability impacts.  The educational and workforce development components of this project will broaden understanding of the technical and environmental aspects of wave energy among a new generation of engineers and scientists, as well as among the general public.",NSF,4900,LEHIGH UNIVERSITY,Alumni Building 27,Bethlehem,US,Bethlehem,PA15,Lehigh University,PA,180153005,47.070,"['Rick S Blum', 'Lawrence V Snyder', 'Arindam  Banerjee', 'Alberto  Lamadrid']",08/18/2014,808264444,900000,12/31/2018,4900,CyberSEES,900000,1442858,068570936,Shalinee  Kishore,19 Memorial Drive West,Bethlehem,US,Bethlehem,PA15,Lehigh University,PA,180153084,skishore@lehigh.edu,Shalinee,Kishore,,6107584517,rshah@nsf.gov,Rahul Shah,7032928910,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,"['Lamadrid, A.J.~Optimal use of energy storage systems with renewable energy sources~Journal of Electrical Power&Energy Systems~~2015~~~~0~ ~0~ ~03/10/2018 04:00:12.883000000', 'Lamadrid,  A.J.,  Shawhan,  D.L.,  Murillo-Sanchez,  C.E.,  Zimmerman,  R.D.,  Zhu,  Y.,  Tylavsky,  D.J.,  Kindle,A.G., and Dar, Z.~Stochastically Optimized, Carbon-Reducing Dispatch of Storage, Generation, and Loads~IEEE Transactions on Power Systems~~2015~~~~0~ ~0~ ~03/10/2018 04:00:12.883000000', 'Lamadrid A.J., with Mo, J.Y, and Mount, T.~Using Deferrable Demand in a Smart Grid to Reduce the Costof Electricity for Customers~Journal of Regulatory Economics~~2015~~~~0~ ~0~ ~03/10/2018 04:00:12.883000000', 'Kostas Hatalis, Basel Alnajjab, Shalinee Kishore, Alberto Lamadrid, Rick S Blum~Particle Swarm Based Model Exploitation for Parameter Estimation of Wave Realizations~IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence~~2016~~~~0~ ~0~ ~28/12/2016 16:27:33.740000000', 'Kostas Hatalis, Shalinee Kishore~On Enabling Autonomous Operation and Control of Ocean Wave Energy Farms~Proceedings of the Marine Energy Technology Symposium~~2015~~~~0~ ~0~ ~28/12/2016 16:27:33.746000000', 'Kostas Hatalis, Shalinee Kishore~A Multi-Agent System Architecture for Operational Autonomy in Ocean Wave Energy Farms~28th International Flairs Conference~~2015~~~~0~ ~0~ ~28/12/2016 16:27:33.750000000', 'Zheng Zhou, Mugen Peng, Zhongyuan Zhao, Wenbo Wang, and Rick S.

428,"From writing an encyclopedia, to developing software, to folding proteins, more and more problems that used to be solved by small groups of experts are now being solved by much larger ""crowds"" of people using the Internet. For many complex problems, however, the creativity, energy, and diversity that crowds bring are not enough to solve the problems. Various kinds of specialized knowledge that only experts have are also needed. This project focuses on creating the cyber-infrastructure to combine these two kinds of resources--experts and crowds--in solving complex societal problems. The project will address this question in the context of what many people believe is one of humanity?s most important sustainability challenges today: how to deal with trending environmental dynamics. Much of the proposed work includes developing and testing ideas on the team's CoLab, a software platform and online community focused on this issue, which was developed with prior NSF and other support.  More specifically, the project will investigate how experts and crowds can work together to perform four key problem-solving activities: decomposing the overall problem into smaller pieces, generating potential solutions for the pieces, integrating the pieces into overall solutions, and evaluating the solutions. For example, the project will study (a) whether crowds generate better ideas when they start with ""seed"" ideas from experts, (b) how certain kinds of expert knowledge can be encoded in computer simulation models that crowds can use on their own, and (c) to what degree expert evaluations can be approximated by combinations of semi-experts, novices, and software tools.
					
The results are expected to include (a) open source software applicable to many sustainability and other challenges, (b) a set of processes and methodologies with which communities can effectively use this software, and (c) a diverse community of tens of thousands of people using this approach to address issues associated with trending environmental changes.  The primary intellectual contribution of the proposed work will be better processes and computer tools for creating on-line communities that combine the best features of both experts and crowds to solve complex societal problems.

By engaging students and the general public to come up with credible ideas for what people can do about complex problems, this project will help educate a much broader community about the actual issues involved.

430,"The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is not just another telescope, but a new approach to survey science and data-based astronomy.  Existing 6-meter to 10-meter ground-based telescopes all have relatively small fields of view and are operated in the traditional mode where a given project is pursued for a few nights at a time, after which different astronomers pursue data addressing a different scientific goal, possibly with a different instrument.  Although this approach can make great advances, there are some crucial scientific problems that need to be tackled more like a physics experiment, whereby a dedicated instrument is used for a finite period of time to address well-defined objectives.  This is the LSST: a large survey telescope using a wide field camera to image the accessible sky repeatedly to very faint limits over a ten-year period.  The LSST data products will change every field of astronomical study, from the inner Solar System to the large scale structure of the Universe.

LSST will map the inner and outer Solar System, study stellar populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, reveal the structure of the Milky Way disk and halo and other local objects, find transient and variable objects at both low and high redshift, and survey the properties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift.  Turning to far-field cosmological topics, LSST will explore the properties of supernovae to redshifts around one, uncover strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and baryon oscillations, and show how these different probes may be combined to constrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.

LSST will be built on the El Peñón peak on Cerro Pachón in northern Chile.  LSST will have an effective aperture of 6.7 meters and an imaging camera with field of view 9.6 square degrees, and will be devoted to a ten-year imaging survey over 20,000 square degrees south of +15 deg.  Each pointing will be imaged 2000 times with fifteen second exposures in six broad bands at wavelengths from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to a total point-source depth of r~27.5 magnitudes.  LSST's three large mirrors are actively controlled to minimize distortion, and the telescope structure is especially compact and stiff to reduce image motion and to enable rapid travel across the sky, maximizing the observing duty cycle.  The project is an interagency public-private partnership, with the Department of Energy accepting responsibility for the world-leading camera, while NSF as overall lead agency will support the site facility, the telescope, and the extensive and sophisticated data management.  Private donations have supported initial construction work that significantly reduces project risk, including the innovative primary-tertiary mirror, early site work, and development of sensors for the camera.  LSST will produce on average 15 terabytes of raw data per night and an uncompressed data set for the full ten-year survey of some 200 petabytes.  Dedicated facilities will process the image data in near real time.

The image archive and resulting catalogs will be widely and freely available.  A sophisticated data management system will enable work ranging from simple queries from individual users to computationally intensive scientific investigations that could use the entire data set.  The LSST Project is at the forefront of the information technology revolution and includes investments in technology, cyber-infrastructure, education, and outreach.  With one of the largest scientific databases in existence, the LSST project presents challenging opportunities for research into database architecture and data mining.  Education and public outreach programs are fully integrated with the research program and include engaging experiences for non-specialists, partnerships with museums, schools, and industry, and opportunities to challenge and encourage tomorrow's innovators.",NSF,4900,"ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITIES FOR RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY, INC.",1331 Pennsylvania Ave. NW,Washington,US,,DC00,"Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc.",DC,200040000,47.049,"['Victor  Krabbendam', 'Steven  Kahn']",08/01/2014,057905887,471150675,09/30/2022,4900,LSST,326988783,1202910,057905887,Charles Mattias  Mountain,1212 New York Avenue,Washington,US,Washington,DC00,AURA/Large Synoptic Survey Telescope,DC,200053929,nsfnotifications@aura-astronomy.org,Charles Mattias,Mountain,,2024832101,eajhar@nsf.gov,Edward Ajhar,7032927456,040551 NSF MAJOR RESEARCH EQUIPMENT,,,,07/01/2014,Construction of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) under the Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) Account,CoopAgrmnt
431,"In this International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project, U.S. graduate and undergraduate students under the supervision of Professors Mary T. Rodgers of Wayne State University and Peter B. Armentrout of the University of Utah will participate in international collaborative research projects with Dutch counterpartners and institutions to investigate the roles of metal ion interactions in biology, energy and catalysis, and the environment.  The biological, catalytic, and environmentally oriented mass spectrometry and spectroscopic studies they carry out are expected to add to the rapidly growing and evolving research areas that interest a broad community of researchers. Each U.S. cohort will be assigned collaborate on several projects, with each student acting as the lead researcher on a particular project.  Outcomes from this IRES are expected to contribute to the underpinnings of these methodologies and add to their continuing development, while contributing to STEM workforce preparation.

Twice a year for three years, U.S. student cohorts will travel to the Netherlands for month long research visits to participate in cooperative research projects that make use of unique Dutch instrumentation (laser systems and mass spectrometers) and cyber infrastructure at the Free Electron Lasers for Infrared eXperiments (FELIX) facility at the Radboud University Nijmegen.  The FELIX facility in the Netherlands is an international user facility supported by an advanced technical staff as well as faculty, students, and postdoctoral fellows associated with the university. Planned experiments are designed to measure directly the infrared spectra of the metal-ligand complexes, thereby providing structural and mechanistic information through the analysis of the observed photodissociation pathways along with concomitant theoretical work. Because the FELIX facility welcomes a wide variety of researchers from around the globe, IRES participants should benefit from an exceptional, early career opportunity to interact with Dutch partners as well as researchers from other institutions and countries.  Theoretical calculations, additional data analysis, and preparation of the results for presentation will continue after the students return to the U.S., culminating in the expected outcome of scientific publications, under the guidance of the U.S. PIs and Dutch mentors.  Pre- and post visit surveys along with a three-year follow-up survey will be administered to assess the success of this IRES program. A website for this U.S.-Netherlands IRES program will make the results of the program available to participants, the broader scientific community, and the public.",NSF,4900,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,5057 Woodward,Detroit,US,Detroit,MI13,Wayne State University,MI,482023622,47.079,['Peter B Armentrout'],07/31/2014,001962224,250000,08/31/2019,4900,IRES Track I: IRES Sites (IS),250000,1357887,001962224,Mary T Rodgers,P.

432,"Some of the most pressing questions for social scientists -- ranging from efforts to better understand the interactions between humans and the environment to predicting how an aging population will impact the US and global economy -- require making sense of large amounts of data. As a result, social scientists are increasingly using new computational modeling methods to explore the dynamics and consequences of human interactions. These new methods, including agent-based models, provide ways to explore research questions that cannot be investigated using traditional statistical approaches.  But appropriate methods to mine, analyze, and synthesis large-scale complex model output data in order to answer social science research questions are still lacking. Traditional analysis methods are designed for data that are linear, continuous, and normally distributed, while data from models of complex socio-ecological systems are non-linear, discontinuous, and power-law distributed. In this project, the researchers seek to address these challenges by developing, applying, and disseminating an integrated environment for analysis and visualization of data generated by complex systems models. An important broader impact is that the research will lead to tools that will allow stakeholders, policy makers, and the general public to explore, interact with, and provide feedback on otherwise difficult-to-understand models.

The project builds on ongoing research by the project team, and uses the NSF-supported CoMSES Net Computational Modeling Library as a platform to make this suite of collaborative, open-source tools broadly available. This community environment will allow any users to post model output along with associated metadata, visualize and analyze output data, comment on and share analyses, and conduct comparative and meta-analysis, drawing on data from other projects. This cyber-infrastructure will provide semi-automated means of discovering relationships that can lead to new theories about how social systems work, test the realism of simulations against knowledge from empirical systems, and propose new research directions to explore.",NSF,4900,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY,ORSPA,TEMPE,US,Tempe,AZ09,Arizona State University,AZ,852816011,47.075,,07/22/2014,943360412,124989,07/31/2018,4900,DiD Challenge,124989,1430411,806345658,C Michael  Barton,,Tempe,US,Tempe,AZ09,Arizona State University,AZ,852816011,Michael.barton@asu.edu,C Michael,Barton,,4809656262,ceavey@nsf.gov,Cheryl L.

433,"This workshop will focus on the bridging of the cyberinfrastructure/data visualization and polar communities and it is scheduled to be held in New York City at the Parsons New School for Design in November 2014. Improving the use and the value of existing data sets over the polar regions is crucial to promote science and support new discoveries. Ultimately, collaborations between data visualization experts and polar scientists will foster the understanding of the variability of the polar regions at different timescales, with implicit benefit for the society. 
The participants will be motivated by several public Polar datasets that will be acquired and made available before the starting date of the workshop. One of the expected outcomes is to produce high impact and novel prototypes and data visualizations that will be made available under open source licenses. Releasing the prototypes will allow the NSF to make longer-term investments in technologies and visualizations that can be adopted by the community. The workshop will also increase cross agency collaboration between NSF, NASA, NOAA and other Arctic/Polar related agencies.
The organizing committee is composed by both cyberinfrastructure and polar experts, including participation from academia, industry, the federally funded research and development centers, and from the broader open source community. The workshop will: (1) recommend several sets of open source software for data and metadata processing; scientific workflow management; data curation; and data dissemination; (2) identify some relevant Polar data visualization techniques and assess the needs and challenges of visualizing Polar datasets; (3) package, deliver, and make available the outcomes of the workshop via a public website; and (4) provide input to the NSF Polar CyberInfrastructure program officer through a final report.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,University Park,Los Angeles,US,Los Angeles,CA37,University of Southern California,CA,900890001,47.050,,07/02/2014,072933393,49997,06/30/2015,4900,POLAR CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE,49997,1445624,072933393,Chris A Mattmann,3720 S.

 Science data sets concerning the Polar regions are currently underutilized relative to their potential value - 

these data relate to U.S. and international maritime, oil and natural resources, and climate oriented concerns. It is exceedingly difficult to ask concise and scientific questions of this information since doing so involves a combination of high powered data processing; information retrieval, big data, and data visualization tech- nologies to be orchestrated together and combined for many diverse end users. Improving the use and value of existing polar region data sets is crucial to understanding the polar regions variability over different timescales, with consequent associated benefits for society. One of the critical first steps towards realising such improvements involves fostering effective collaborations, communications and meetings between those community experts in data visualization; big data processing, information retrieval, and polar scientists. 

The U.S. National Science Foundation ""DataViz Hackathon for Polar CyberInfrastructure"" was designed to both bridge the cyberinfrastructure data visualization and polar science communities through informal collaboration,and to notably improve the use and value of polar region data sets through the adaptation of visualization tools for polar data. 




HACKATHON IMPLEMENTATION
 Forty polar scientists, data engineers, and design scholars, from a diverse set of institutions (see figure 1) gathered in New York in November for 2 days. Recognising the need for design expertise in visualisation problems it was hosted at The Parsons Institute for Information Mapping, personnel from here provided invaluable input from a third community not traditionally engaged by either polar science or cyber-infrastructure. Following introductory remarks and goalsetting by both the polar and cyberinfrastructure communities, lightning talks by session leaders served to guide participants into self forming hack sub- groups.Following a pattern of discuss-hack-review-repeat, over the course of 4 half-day hack sessions in total, these groups practically tackled the issues and goals set forth. These sessions resulted in 42 commits to a communal github account created for the event. 







HACKATHON CONCLUSIONS AND RECCOMMENDATIONS
 Overwhelmingly participants indicated they would be likely attend another similar event, valuing most highly the trans-disciplinary interactions and networking opportunities, and most commonly lamenting the limited time in which to accomplish ambitious goals. Based on this feedback, and the practical outcomes achieved (code commits,skill and knowledge transfers, and new collaborations) it is recommended other similar event be held, particularly for this conjunction of domains. 

Given the combined relative novelty of hosting a transdisciplinary, unconference, the organising committee learnt many practical lessons which should be of use to future event organisers. 

Based on the transdisciplinary nature of the event, it is recommend that a greater effort be made, prior to the event or in introductions, to educate all participants as regards communicating with members of other domains and explaining some of the points of likely misunderstanding. For instance the science and engineering community here would have benefited from an overview of the nature of the design process, while the design and visualisation community would have found an explanation of the need for precision in science data helpful. In both cases such explanations would have reduced the time spent on unnecessary discussions. 

In regards to the ""unconference"" nature of a hackathon, the use of a public hosting forums such as Github was highly successful in helping facilitate organisation prior to, during, and post the event, and it is therefore recommended. Participants also requested that future events be, longer (3 days at least), have more narrowly focused session goals, ...",,['C.

434,"Angela Wilson, of the University of North Texas, is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division and the Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering Program (CDS&E) to develop a group of accurate, efficient, and easily usable quantum mechanical computational approaches to study the heavy elements, those elements at the bottom of the periodic table.  The Division of Advanced Cyber Infrastructure contributes funding for this award.  The need for environmental sustainability offers both opportunities and challenges for computational chemistry research.  Examples of problems that need to be addressed are the design of environmentally benign materials and processes, the development of alternative or renewable energy sources, the design of new, more efficient catalysts and the replacement of often expensive critical resources that are in short-supply.   To address these major scientific challenges, information regarding the relative energies of molecular species is often critical for the rational analysis and design of molecular species and materials. However, one of the long-standing challenges in computational chemistry is in achieving chemically accurate energetics, due to the extensive computational requirements (computer time, memory, and disk space) of the methods required, severely limiting the size of molecules that can be studied routinely with high accuracy. The challenges become even more substantial for heavy elements, where the evolution of practical, high accuracy approaches has been much less developed. The computational tools that the Wilson group develops are designed lead to new, more accessible, and improved chemical predictions.  The software and data base implemented in this project will be widely available to the research community.

In this project, Wilson and her research group have the following goals:  (1)  Developing ab initio composite schemes tailored for 4f species, whose chemistry has received increasing scrutiny due to sustainability concerns.  The composite schemes are being implemented within freely available computational chemistry software packages to enable dissemination to the broader scientific community. (2) Developing and utilizing databases for gauging theoretical methodologies for the transition metals.  These datasets and databases will be made available publicly. (3)  Applying these computational tools to chemical species and processes of relevance to environmental sustainability, including alternative strategies for rare earth elements.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS,1155 Union Circle #305250,DENTON,US,Denton,TX26,University of North Texas,TX,762035017,47.049,,06/23/2014,614168995,454212,03/31/2016,4900,CONDENSED MATTER & MAT THEORY,0,1362479,064117963,Angela K Wilson,,,US,Denton,TX26,University of North Texas,TX,762035017,wilson@chemistry.msu.edu,Angela,Wilson,K,9405654296,dhess@nsf.gov,Daryl W.

435,"The scientific community is awash in 'big data' but few practicing ecologists use these data to answer important ecological questions. They rely instead on the traditional approach of collecting new, experimental data focused on particular species, habitats, or problems. In addition, the data-intensive computational methods commonly needed to analyze big datasets are not easily accessible to most researchers. This high-risk, high-reward project could dramatically alter both the ways in which ecologists address questions and the types of questions that they tackle. It therefore represents a major contribution to NSF's efforts to extend ecological research in new directions to provide answers to more complex questions. 

A knowledge-driven, open access system that 'learns' and becomes more efficient and easier to use as data streams increase in variety and size is needed for timely scientific progress in an era of big data. This approach is centered on establishing linkages between databases and hypothesis-based inquiry that result in the derivation of new or refined hypotheses as a result of improved access to dynamic databases. The investigators recently implemented a hypothesis-driven, process-based analytical methodology that was conceptually integrated with a data-intensive machine learning approach. This integrated approach allowed them to use multiple long-term datasets to narrow a diverse suite of mechanistic explanations to a single, most likely process. This process was then tested by a short-term experiment that saved time and money and yielded a more definitive answer than the more traditional approach described above. To further this approach, this project will test, refine, and automate this new integrative effort to develop a prototype cyber-infrastructure capable of significantly advancing the environmental sciences. Open access data, programming scripts, and derived data products will reduce the time lag for knowledge transfer from an individual to the research community, likely increase the speed of scientific progress, and provide a filter and memory for how to deal with large amounts of data of mixed quality.

However, many scientists have not accepted the data deluge as an integral part of their research because the current scientific method is not scalable to large, complex datasets. This EAGER project developed and implemented a novel knowledge, learning, analysis system (KLAS) for discovery and problem solving. KLAS is envisioned as integrating a data-intensive, machine learning approach with a hypothesis-driven, mechanistic approach. Machine learning leads to more efficient, user-friendly analytics as the streams of data increase while hypothesis-driven decisions lead to the strategic design of experiments to fill knowledge gaps and to elucidate mechanisms.

In this EAGER, we took the first steps to show that KLAS can be developed as a human and machine learning system.  We built a prototype of the KLAS processing unit using R and the Shiny library to upload, visualize, preprocess, and process data. KLAS was deployed and hosted on a local server where is able to handle multiple users at the same time and have access to other databases. The graphical user interface (GUI) provides features to interact with the data and for collaborating with other users and sharing experiments, data repository management, and experiment logs. Virtual users were used to train and test KLAS in order to provide a broad range of conditions under a short time frame. The KLAS prototype is working for datasets focused on meterological data, and can be scaled to larger, and more diverse data through the future incorporation of a database. Future developments to KLAS are expected to lead to a software that can transform ecology and environmental sciences by shortening the time lag between individual discoveries and leaps in knowledge by the scientific community, and lead to paradigm shifts predicated on open access data and analytics in a machine learning environment.

This project will establish a new approach for materials simulation and modeling that links informatics methods to Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The discovery of new chemistries of perovskites that possess high Curie transition temperatures are the template for this study; although the computational methodology that is being developed is generic to any class of materials problems. The approach exploits and develops statistical learning and graph theoretic methodologies to discover patterns of behavior among known materials that can be used to generate design rules for identifying structure - property relationships in new compounds; and will serve to guide and target DFT calculations to specific chemistries with the desired properties. Specifically, the project is developing a rule-based design approach, based on informatics, to identify new chemistries of high temperature piezoelectric perovskites by exploring vast chemical space, so large, that it would otherwise have been prohibitive to study by solely experimental and/or computational methods. The intellectual impact of this work will be to transform the traditional use of computational materials science from one of building large data repositories where informatics is primarily used as a search engine for compounds, to one where data science methods are used as a learning engine to uncover new physics and suggest new directions for conducting detailed computations on promising chemistries that would otherwise remain unidentified.

This award from the National Science Foundation to Rutgers University in New Brunswick is for the development of a new computer architecture with multiple levels of interconnected memory, optimized for the simulation of strongly correlated materials from first principles calculations.  Strongly correlated materials have the potential to be transformative, two examples: thermoelectric materials, which can generate electricity from waste heat with high efficiency; and, superconductors with potential for higher critical temperatures, fields, and currents, which can revolutionize the electric grid by reducing transmission losses.  The use of computational methods to accelerate the pace of discovery of materials with desirable properties is one of the greatest challenges in condensed matter science.  Materials with strongly correlated electron systems are particularly difficult to simulat because their physical properties cannot be accurately represented in terms of a system of independent particles moving in an average potential, thus requiring new methodologies and powerful supercomputers for their theoretical description.

440,"SUMMARY
Modeling realistic polymeric and soft matter systems requires coverage of time intervals from nanoseconds to seconds or minutes. Even with modern supercomputers, such a wide dynamic range can only be achieved by performing multi-scale modeling that couples atomistic molecular simulations with coarse-grained or field-based simulations in a self-consistent manner. Advances in theory, modeling, computation, and data-mining are beginning to offer a foundation for the rational design of soft matter and polymers, and their assemblies at nanometer to macroscopic scales.
Many challenges remain in interfacing disparate methods appropriate at different scales and in managing the massive data sets arising from tandem use of multi-scale simulations and high-throughput experimentation, including the establishment of standards for data collection, data mining and analysis, and storage.
This award support provides support for a workshop to be held at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) on the topic of opportunities and challenges for theory and simulation related to the first-principles design of polymers and soft materials. A diverse group of participants will be drawn broadly from academic physics, chemistry, and materials engineering disciplines, along with representatives from synergistic fields such as biology and applied mathematics. Approximately 10% of the proposed participants are from outside the US and several are employed by or have experience in industry. The workshop will be held Sunday, October 20 through Tuesday, October 22, 2013.
The workshop aims to (i) identify the major theoretical and computational challenges relating to the first-principles design of broad classes of soft materials and polymers; (ii) identify the missing tools/methods necessary to address these challenges and the steps required to develop the methods; (iii) construct a vision for how theory, computation, and experiment can interact synergistically to discover new materials; and (iv) elaborate the theoretical advances and cyber infrastructure needed to enable more effective synergistic interaction.  
The workshop will include the identification of opportunities that lie at the interfaces with other fields, such as biology, energy production, storage and conversion, and water purification and reuse; the identification of materials design problems of importance to industry and methods for strengthening academe-industry-national lab partnerships; and strategies for educating the next generation of scientists to be trained to work effectively at this scientific frontier.

441,"The goal of the proposed research is to understand how individual-level identities are communicated and verified in virtual teams, in order to develop technology-design guidelines aimed at improving the identity communication and verification process. Identity communication is defined as the methods that a person uses to convey his/her identity (Thatcher, Doucet, & Tuncel, 2001) and identity verification refers to the process of bringing others to confirm one's identity (Swann, 1983). The technology that facilitates communication in virtual teams can distort individual-level identities by heightening (Walther, 2008) or hiding (Weisband, 2002) them. The technology can thus create a social barrier to participation in virtual teams, negatively influencing a number of individual and group outcomes, including overall team success (Gomez, Huici, Seyle, & Swann, 2009). We adopt a mixed-methods research approach (Venkatesh, Brown, & Bala, 2013) to develop design guidelines for systems that improve identity communication and verification in virtual environments. Data will be collected in three phases, leveraging qualitative and quantitative techniques including interviews, surveys, and experiments.

The broader impacts of this project are in four key areas. First, our research will result in specific guidelines for designing information technology to support effective identity communication and verification in virtual environments. We will explain how the characteristics of various communication media influence identity communication and verification. Organizations can use this information not only during the onset of new virtual teams, but also as continuous improvement initiatives or when new members join an existing team. Second, we help organizations understand how to choose among different types and characteristics of communication technology to most effectively manage identity communication and verification. By understanding users' individual and task-related needs, organizations can deploy the best technologies to improve identity communication and verification given these specific characteristics. Third, with the increased use of online learning environments, we expect that the results of this work can be used to enhance both the teaching and learning experience by providing guidelines to enhance identity communication and verification in the educational context. For example, a common criticism of online learning experiences is that students do not feel a connection with their instructors or other students. Understanding how technology can enhance identity communication and verification can go a long way in helping us to develop effective online teaching tools. Fourth, a better understanding of identity communication and verification in virtual teams will have direct implications for NSF-sponsored virtual organizations, enhancing the effectiveness of cross-disciplinary and remote collaborations. Virtual teams offer a cost-effective and practical way to bring together diverse people from cross-disciplinary fields regardless of temporal or spatial restrictions; however, even face-to-face cross-disciplinary teams often experience communication difficulties (Oetzel, 2008), and these difficulties are generally exacerbated in virtual settings. By pointing the way toward more effective and sustainable virtual organizations, our research can thus strengthen the cyber-infrastructure for cross-disciplinary science and engineering research.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,888 N Euclid Ave,Tucson,US,Tucson,AZ03,University of Arizona,AZ,857194824,47.070,,08/12/2013,806345617,248776,07/31/2016,4900,VIRTUAL ORGANIZATIONS,248776,1322104,072459266,Susan A Brown,1130 E Helen St,Tucson,US,Tucson,AZ03,University of Arizona,AZ,857210108,suebrown@eller.arizona.edu,Susan,Brown,A,5206266000,rramnath@nsf.gov,Rajiv Ramnath,7032924776,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Managers are increasingly aware of the importance of employees? identity communications&mdash;efforts of employees to convey their self-definitions to their coworkers&mdash;in influencing important organizational outcomes, including job satisfaction, organizational citizenship, and positive social relationships at work. But even as virtual communication and collaboration technologies continue to transform the modern economy, the infusion of technology into the everyday operations of most organizations has important implications for our understanding of identity and identity communication in the workplace. The purpose of this project was to explore the unique identity challenges associated with these new communication media. Specifically, the role that technology plays in identity communication among virtual teams, how identity communication affects various outcomes within virtual teams, and how these relationships change depending on the types of tasks a virtual team is engaged in.

Over the course of three years, the research team collected data using a variety of methods. These included detailed qualitative interviews with working professionals, careful survey measure development, and a variety of behavioral experiments. All of these collected data and their analysis provide insights into the nature of identity communication in an increasingly virtual workplace. Our findings over the course of the project also informed the development of an experimental collaboration system. This system&mdash;called AZ Chat&mdash;was developed in order to explicitly test the effects of identity communication on the success of virtual teams. The system provides researchers the ability to manipulate a large number of technology features that, according to our research findings, affect the identity communication process within a virtual team. We have used this system to enact several of our own experiments, and future research teams may build on this with other system enhancements.

Our research results highlight three important things. First, the characteristics of the communication media clearly play a role in an individual?s ability to communicate his/her identity. Interestingly, we found that although people verbally express a preference for richer media &ndash; media that is closest to face-to-face interaction &ndash; when surveyed, they demonstrate a preference for mediated communication with high rehearsability, meaning that they can try out what they communicate before they actually do it. Rehearsability is normally associated with lower richness.  We did find that there are some factors that influence this relationship; for example, individuals who are high in self-monitoring are the most likely to prefer less rich media.  A second interesting result was that for at least one type of task, negotiation, we found no differences in performance for teams that shared identity information and those that did not. This is contrary to the general understanding that identity communication leads to satisfaction and warrants additional study. Finally, our results demonstrate that certain identity motives are particularly important in virtual environments, namely the belongingness and self-efficacy motives. We extended the identity motive literature by suggesting that virtual environments require the addition of two new identity motives: self creation and self protection.  Our results support the inclusion of self-creation as an important virtual identity communication motive. Further, we found that virtual communication in the presence of peers and superiors is different. Individuals interacting with superiors were positively motivated by self-enhancement and self-protection. In sum, our results highlight the importance of media characteristics, task-type, and identity motives to provide a rich picture of identity communication in virtual environments.

Overall, our research has provided significant impacts, both on our theoretical understanding of virtual identity communication, and also in informing the design and optimal use of virtual communication technologies in modern organizations.

442,"The goal of the proposed research is to understand how individual-level identities are communicated and verified in virtual teams, in order to develop technology-design guidelines aimed at improving the identity communication and verification process. Identity communication is defined as the methods that a person uses to convey his/her identity (Thatcher, Doucet, & Tuncel, 2001) and identity verification refers to the process of bringing others to confirm one's identity (Swann, 1983). The technology that facilitates communication in virtual teams can distort individual-level identities by heightening (Walther, 2008) or hiding (Weisband, 2002) them. The technology can thus create a social barrier to participation in virtual teams, negatively influencing a number of individual and group outcomes, including overall team success (Gomez, Huici, Seyle, & Swann, 2009). We adopt a mixed-methods research approach (Venkatesh, Brown, & Bala, 2013) to develop design guidelines for systems that improve identity communication and verification in virtual environments. Data will be collected in three phases, leveraging qualitative and quantitative techniques including interviews, surveys, and experiments.

The broader impacts of this project are in four key areas. First, our research will result in specific guidelines for designing information technology to support effective identity communication and verification in virtual environments. We will explain how the characteristics of various communication media influence identity communication and verification. Organizations can use this information not only during the onset of new virtual teams, but also as continuous improvement initiatives or when new members join an existing team. Second, we help organizations understand how to choose among different types and characteristics of communication technology to most effectively manage identity communication and verification. By understanding users' individual and task-related needs, organizations can deploy the best technologies to improve identity communication and verification given these specific characteristics. Third, with the increased use of online learning environments, we expect that the results of this work can be used to enhance both the teaching and learning experience by providing guidelines to enhance identity communication and verification in the educational context. For example, a common criticism of online learning experiences is that students do not feel a connection with their instructors or other students. Understanding how technology can enhance identity communication and verification can go a long way in helping us to develop effective online teaching tools. Fourth, a better understanding of identity communication and verification in virtual teams will have direct implications for NSF-sponsored virtual organizations, enhancing the effectiveness of cross-disciplinary and remote collaborations. Virtual teams offer a cost-effective and practical way to bring together diverse people from cross-disciplinary fields regardless of temporal or spatial restrictions; however, even face-to-face cross-disciplinary teams often experience communication difficulties (Oetzel, 2008), and these difficulties are generally exacerbated in virtual settings. By pointing the way toward more effective and sustainable virtual organizations, our research can thus strengthen the cyber-infrastructure for cross-disciplinary science and engineering research.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,Sponsored Awards Management,COLUMBIA,US,Columbia,SC06,University of South Carolina at Columbia,SC,292080001,47.070,,08/12/2013,041387846,81225,07/31/2016,4900,VIRTUAL ORGANIZATIONS,81225,1322001,041387846,Sherry  Thatcher,,Columbia,US,Columbia,SC06,University of South Carolina at Columbia,SC,292080001,sherry.thatcher@moore.sc.edu,Sherry,Thatcher,,8037777093,rramnath@nsf.gov,Rajiv Ramnath,7032924776,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Managers are increasingly aware of the importance of employees? identity communications&mdash;efforts of employees to convey their self-definitions to their coworkers&mdash;in influencing important organizational outcomes, including job satisfaction, organizational citizenship, and positive social relationships at work. But even as virtual communication and collaboration technologies continue to transform the modern economy, the infusion of technology into the everyday operations of most organizations has important implications for our understanding of identity and identity communication in the workplace. The purpose of this project was to explore the unique identity challenges associated with these new communication media. Specifically, the role that technology plays in identity communication among virtual teams, how identity communication affects various outcomes within virtual teams, and how these relationships change depending on the types of tasks a virtual team is engaged in. 

 

Over the course of three years, the research team collected data using a variety of methods. These included detailed qualitative interviews with working professionals, careful survey measure development, and a variety of behavioral experiments. All of these collected data and their analysis provide insights into the nature of identity communication in an increasingly virtual workplace. Our findings over the course of the project also informed the development of an experimental collaboration system. This system&mdash;called AZ Chat&mdash;was developed in order to explicitly test the effects of identity communication on the success of virtual teams. The system provides researchers the ability to manipulate a large number of technology features that, according to our research findings, affect the identity communication process within a virtual team. We have used this system to enact several of our own experiments, and future research teams may build on this with other system enhancements.

 

Our research results highlight three important things. First, the characteristics of the communication media clearly play a role in an individual?s ability to communicate his/her identity. Interestingly, we found that although people verbally express a preference for richer media &ndash; media that is closest to face-to-face interaction &ndash; when surveyed, they demonstrate a preference for mediated communication with high rehearsability, meaning that they can try out what they communicate before they actually do it. Rehearsability is normally associated with lower richness.  We did find that there are some factors that influence this relationship; for example, individuals who are high in self-monitoring are the most likely to prefer less rich media.  A second interesting result was that for at least one type of task, negotiation, we found no differences in performance for teams that shared identity information and those that did not. This is contrary to the general understanding that identity communication leads to satisfaction and warrants additional study. Finally, our results demonstrate that certain identity motives are particularly important in virtual environments, namely the belongingness and self-efficacy motives. We extended the identity motive literature by suggesting that virtual environments require the addition of two new identity motives: self creation and self protection.  Our results support the inclusion of self-creation as an important virtual identity communication motive. Further, we found that virtual communication in the presence of peers and superiors is different. Individuals interacting with superiors were positively motivated by self-enhancement and self-protection. In sum, our results highlight the importance of media characteristics, task-type, and identity motives to provide a rich picture of identity communication in virtual environments. 

 

Overall, our research has provided significant impacts, both on our theoretical understanding of virtual identity communication, and also in informing the design and optimal use of virtual communication technologies in modern organizations. Managers in organizations who would like to empower their virtual workforce with the benefits of identity communication, as well as the designers of the software applications that support such identity communication, can benefit from the insights generated from our work.

443,"This project will build upon the successful development of models, algorithms, and software for planning and job scheduling systems developed during previous NSF research. The product is designed to allow organizations to schedule their operations in real-time and generate the optimal plan to maximize their operational targets. Through prior research, the project team created new planning and scheduling algorithms, a software prototype, and successful empirical studies using the newly developed methodology of Nested Partitions. After creating and proving this methodology, the team plans to further develop the technology for widespread use. 

The proposed scheduling and planning tool could enable companies to communicate, collaborate, and integrate their planning and scheduling functionalities to obtain optimal results throughout their enterprise and their entire supply chain. It is expected that coordinated use of these tools could eventually create an integrated cyber-infrastructure for American manufacturing firms and create more efficient supply chains through the use of effective scheduling that will enable these firms to be more competitive and flexible in the global marketplace.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SYSTEM,21 North Park Street,MADISON,US,Madison,WI02,University of Wisconsin-Madison,WI,537151218,47.041,,06/25/2013,161202122,50000,12/31/2013,4900,I-Corps,50000,1343665,041188822,Leyuan  Shi,1513 University Ave.,Madison,US,Madison,WI02,University of Wisconsin-Madison,WI,537061539,leyuan@ie.engr.wisc.edu,Leyuan,Shi,,6082655969,@nsf.gov,,,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The technology our team investigated during the 2013 summer I-Corps cohort was a scheduling software. Our software applies a set of starte-of-the-art optimzation framework to determine the best schedule for a set of manufacturing resources, operators, and jobs.

 

The current solutions are not capable of managing the complexity of the problem, and the increasing amount of data coming in. The complexity of the problem and simplicity in current solutions lead a factory to operate at a sub-par performance level, and spend more resources on managing the scheduling process.

 

By leveraging state-of-the-art optimization techniques, our solution can handle the increasing complexity and information flows of the current and future Manufacturing Industry. By operating to a more effective schedule, factories should see improvements in lead time, capacity, inventory, and a reduction in waste. Through the use of a cloud framework, our software can greatly reduce the amount of resources required to schedule and manage the scheduling process, allowing the business to operate more effectively.

 

During our time in I-Corps, we interviewed over 80 discrete manufacturers, and were able to learn a great deal from our interactions. Perhaps the most powerful outcome is that we learned as technologists how to take control of our product, and guide it to the correct customer. Before starting I-Corps we thought we knew who our software was good for, would market to them, and when they turned us away we didnÆt understand why ; how hard is it to sell performance increases we thought. However, by interviewing customers and fitting them into Hypothesis categories, we were able to better understand our market landscape.

 

Coming out of the I-Corps program we learned more about our customers than we had in the past years. The biggest challenge we had to overcome was thinking we knew who our customers were, and what they needed. Instead, we needed to listen to what their problem was, and it became clear who our customers could be.

 

Our team has had many outcomes from the I-Corps project. Shortly after the program closed, our team was interviewed by the organization that helped LSO apply to the program. That article is featured here https://wisconsinsbir.org/content/innovators-increase-their-chances-success-leaving-building

 

We have also kept contact with a select handful of our interviewees who showed an interest in our research. We are working with them to explore the topic further, and determine if we can work together to deploy our solution.

 

Development of our software has continued, but we have identified ""versions"" that fit the Hypothesis we formed and validated. While some elements of the software are consistent across all customer groups, there are certain needs unique to a group.

 

A very large outcome of our participation in this program has been the formation of a new Manufacturing System, Next Generation Lean (NGL). By hearing what customerÆs problems were with current systems, we formed a new method around Operations Management, where many of the problems seemed to be. This new system focuses on delivering tools to explore waste, improve performance, and increase the ease of management. A new concept that evolved as part of this program is applying NGL to a supply chain strategy. Meaning within a supply chain, suppliers are expected to measure NGL metrics and are rated on their performance related to these metrics and ability to reduce waste.

 

With the development of NGL, the PI has started a seminar course to explore teaching this new system at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, under the title Modern Operations Management. This class will focus on teaching students the skills they need to perform as management in a Manufacturing environment, to understand system performance and waste, and to deploy or create tools to systematically reduce and control waste. Part of this class also involves meeting with local companies ...",,,07/01/2013,I-Corps:  Cloud-based Advanced Planning & Scheduling Tools for Manufacturing Systems,Grant
444,"High-throughput sequencing has been producing millions of protein sequences without solved structures and functional annotations, which raise demand for computational tools especially user-friendly web servers for protein structure and functional elucidation. This project will transform RaptorX, a popular protein structure modeling web server, to one that can also annotate functions of a protein sequence and the quality of a theoretical protein model in the absence of the corresponding native structure. The resultant new server will greatly facilitate the interpretation and proper usage of a theoretical protein model, just like what E-value does for homology search. The server will also predict functions of a protein sequence with coverage beyond what can be reached by native-structure-based methods and accuracy much higher than sequence-based methods. Ultimately, the project will deliver a long-term sustainable cyber-infrastructure for protein sequence, structure and functional analysis that enables transformative biological and biomedical research. This project will also advance protein structure and functional prediction by developing several sophisticated computational methods for model quality assessment and functional prediction. 

Proteins play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Complete description of protein structures and functions is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life. This project will benefit a broad range of biological/biomedical applications, such as the study of plant metabolic pathways, drug design, and bio-energy development. The research results will be communicated to the broader community through a variety of venues (wiki, talks, papers and posters). The software will be freely available to the public. Since its first release in August 2011, RaptorX has processed dozens of thousands of protein modeling and analysis jobs for more than 3500 users around the world. After the new RaptorX is implemented, it will contribute much more to the broader community. This project will also contribute to computer science by studying machine learning problems inspired from protein bioinformatics. This project shall enrich and disseminate knowledge on protein bioinformatics, machine learning and web programming. It will also train minority students, future K-12 science teachers and nationwide students in the Illinois online bioinformatics program.

Thanks to the support of this grant, RaptorX now yields more accurate predictions than before and has a better user interface. In particular, RaptorX provides the following web services: 1) template-based 3D structure modeling of a protein sequence and model quality assessment; 2) template-based modeling of binding site and residues of a protein sequence; 3) prediction of protein structure properties including secondary structure, solvent accessibility and disorder regions; 4) contact prediction of a protein sequence and contact-assisted protein folding and 5) contact prediction and contact-assisted folding for membrane proteins.

As evaluated by CASP12 in 2016 and the live benchmark CAMEO (http://www.cameo3d.org/), RaptorX is one of the most accurate fully-automated web servers for template-based protein structure modeling. RaptorX is also the best web server for protein contact prediction and contact-assisted protein folding. It can predict much more accurate contacts than the other servers and the contacts predicted by RaptorX can fold many proteins without any good templates in PDB. In the past 6 years, RaptorX has accumulated more than 38,500 worldwide academia and industry users and processed more than 233,000 jobs. RaptorX users also include middle- and high-school students. The standalone programs underlying RaptorX have been downloaded by more than 2100 worldwide users and integrated to currently popular protein structure prediction pipelines.

This project has resulted in more than quite a few peer-reviewed journal and conference papers. The research results have been presented as highlight and keynote talks at various venues including universities, international conferences and workshops such as University of Washington, Michigan State University, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Amazon, RECOMB, ISMB, CASP, ECCB, NIPS, IJCAI, IEEE BIBM, and ACM-BCB, and IEEE ICCABS. The audience includes academia and industry people with background in computer science, statistics, biology and physics. The RaptorX server papers are also highly cited and our recent membrane protein contact prediction paper is featured by Cell Systems. Our work was also reported by Science and The Economist.

This project has trained a number of graduate students, postdocs and summer interns (including two women graduate students and 1 woman undergraduate). Through working on this project, they have received training in the intersection of machine learning, mathematical modeling, computing techniques, web development, biological sciences and communication skills.

Data-intensive research, characterized by the need to efficiently acquire, store, transmit, manipulate, visualize, search, and analyze massive data sets, is increasingly pervasive in all areas of science and industry.  By leveraging Clemson's strength in cyber-infrastructure, a talented pool of faculty mentors, and synergy with an existing NSF-funded program for incoming graduate students in this broad research area, this REU Site aims to (1) expose undergraduates to cutting-edge research in data-intensive computing, (2) provide a detailed instructional program covering the tools and technologies used in this domain, and (3) motivate participants to pursue further advanced study at the graduate level.

Many research projects within this program are highly interdisciplinary in nature, with potential impact within as well as outside the field of computing. The program will contribute to the national talent pool of students with highly-sought skills in data-driven computing research, ultimately feeding both a growing area of graduate computing study, and a crucial sector of the computing workforce.  In addition, the program will also strive to broaden participation in computing by actively recruiting women and students from other under-represented groups, as well as students from institutions with limited resources for providing research opportunities.

446,"This award establishes a new Research Experiences for Teachers site at Drexel University. The Drexel team plans to create a summer research institute in computer science for STEM high school teachers and 2-year college faculty in the City of Philadelphia and Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area.   Teachers will spend the time performing research with faculty and students in the associated labs and initiating work on educational modules for use at their home institutions. They will prepare poster presentations and videos summarizing their projects, initial accomplishments, further expectations and descriptions of their modules.   Participants will remain engaged year-round by participating in Teacher2Teacher discussion groups, facilitated by the Math Forum@Drexel. They will also visit campus for quarterly meetings, culminating in a 1-day showcase event in the spring to present results, materials and posters, and to which their colleagues and students are invited.  The objectives of the program are to build partnerships between high schools, community colleges and the university, introduce teachers to cutting edge research in the computer science community, inform and excite them about computer science principles and computational thinking, produce learning materials for use in high school and community college STEM curricula, and expand the pipeline of students studying STEM and computing curricula in college.

Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit is in the strong research expertise of the participating faculty in research as well as their significant experience with pre-college education.  The focus is on important themes of big data and machine learning which are areas that are current and of importance all citizens. The translation of the research experiences into modules compatible with Computer Science Principles should also add to the significant body of work linking fundamental computer science to classroom practice and applications.

REThink scholars have served as officers of their CSTA chapters, and were involved in rejuvenating the CSTA Southern NJ chapter.

A strong network has developed between teachers outside the program, and they have frequently collaborated in professional and outreach activities, offering outreach activities for middle school and high school girls, co-advising student projects and participating in Philadelphia Science Festival events.

 

Research: REThink scholars participated in a variety of research endeavors beyond the scope of the summer institute.  Included were publications, presentations and workshops at regional (CCSC, CSTA chapter) and national (ISTE, CSTA) conferences.  Some have maintained ongoing relationships with the project directors and faculty mentors beyond their research projects, attending research conferences, and participating in workshops and funding proposals. 

One scholar produced classroom materials that led his students to create a simple flood detection device which monitors water levels and sends tweets about rising levels.  The Downingtown Borough Council has authorized their use around the town, which experiences a high amount of flooding. 

 

Computer Science Principles/Expanding the Pipeline: In the inaugural year of the AP course and exam, five REThink scholars are teaching a combined eight sections of AP CS Principles, with a total enrollment of 197.  Two others are teaching non-AP courses.  One community college teacher is working to develop a CS Principles course at her institution. 

Four high school teachers began teaching computer science at their schools following their REThink experience.  Participating teachers uniformly report infusing concepts of big data and big ideas of CS Principles in their teaching, even for non-CS Principles courses, and for STEM (non-computer science) courses.  Those teaching AP Computer Science A also report using more CS Principles as part of their teaching.  One teacher has had nine students win regional Aspirations in Computing awards from NCWIT.

 

Intellectual Merit: This project combined strong research expertise of the participating faculty, focus on important themes of big data and machine learning, and translating research experiences into modules compatible with CS Principles. Graduate assistants and partner schools and organizations provided continuity and strength to the community.  Collaborative efforts between participating teachers and/or the university have strengthened efforts and provided leadership in the region.

 

Broader Impacts: This project makes significant outreach to the greater Philadelphia metropolitan area, with a population exceeding 5 million, and among the largest school districts in the USA. Partnerships with CSTA chapters help us reach a sizeable core of computing teachers in the area. Big data has wide applicability across disciplines, presenting technical problems even for non-technical domains. Our experiences have produced sizeable impact through the participating teachers and organizations involved, including production of teaching materials, development of CS Principles courses, student recruiting, collaborations, involvement in outreach activities, and leadership of CSTA chapters.

The repository distributed more than 27,000 samples over the past three years, over 70% went to non-OSU investigators. Institutional support includes support for the senior curators-in-charge and recent upgrades to the cyber-infrastructure and to refrigerated storage. The collection was recently expanded with the accessioning of 10,000 samples from the Geosciences Department. Proposed new work includes implementation of a state-of-the art bar coding system. In addition to service to the scientific community, the MGR also participates in K-12 and informal science education projects.",NSF,4900,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,Corvallis,US,Corvallis,OR04,Oregon State University,OR,973318507,47.050,['Anthony  Koppers'],02/21/2013,053599908,779192,02/28/2017,4900,MARINE GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS,789592,1259292,053599908,Joseph S Stoner,,,US,Corvallis,OR04,Oregon State University,OR,973318507,jstoner@coas.oregonstate.edu,Joseph,Stoner,S,5417379002,cmajor@nsf.gov,Candace O. Major,7032927597,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences (CEOAS) at Oregon State University (OSU) maintains the OSU/CEOAS Marine and Geology Repository (OSU-MGR) as an NSF-sponsored community facility. Our mission is to archive and distribute geological samples, predominantly sediment cores, rocks, nodules and sediment trap samples, for scientific research and education. The repository was established in 1971 and since then 6,408 cores totaling 16,821 m, 14,606 rock samples from 589 dredges, 2,200 deep-sea manganese nodules, 1,644 sediment trap samples, 693 plankton tow samples, and other materials have been archived, described and distributed. Since 2013, the collection has grown by 253 cores (643 m), 44 dredges (1,411 samples) and 24,185 samples were distributed from 141 unique requests from 44 institutions in 15 countries, including 27 students/post-docs and 64 researchers. Over the last 25 years, OSU-MGR has distributed almost 163,000 samples for a long-term average of more than 6,500 per year. With more than 30% of the requests coming from cores collected more than 5 years ago a high demand for repository samples remains a predictable component of today's scientific enterprise. And at a total cost to NSF of around $35 per sample, the OSU-MGR represents a substantial long-term savings compared with collecting new materials at a cost of hundreds of dollars per sample. New non-destructive capabilities are adding additional value to the collection and have now been collected for 18 PIs, at 13 institutions, from 100?s of m of core. These data allow us to better characterize our collection and increase its discoverability as we host these data at our new website http://osu-mgr.org.

 

The intellectual merit of the OSU-MGR's collection comes from the papers that are published.  Our Google Scholar page https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x5lYe50AAAAJ&amp;hl=en shows that research on the repositories collect has resulted in more that 8500 citation and an h-index of 50.  Papers in Nature and Science commonly appear from the work done on our collection that is also published in many other leading scientific journals. The OSU-MGR supports national and international scientific research communities through high quality archiving of rocks and sediment under continuous refrigeration that insures that these one-of-a-kind materials are preserved for future research. Our state-of-the-art repository and efficient redistribution services significantly improve the cumulative scientific use of core and rock samples, adding value to the collection and fostering scientific advancement. 68% of our samples go to non-OSU scientists and 37% of these are students. We also support teaching, training, and learning through the use of the repository in graduate, undergraduate, K-12 classes, REU programs, and by opening the repository to the general public for tours and presentations. Our products are disseminated widely through our website and through national databases, such as those provided by NOAA?s National Center for Environmental Information. As a result, the OSU-MGR is a facility that well serves both the national and global communities, while enriching our local community by providing a unique and tangible example of the sea floor few people ever get to see.

448,"The Alliance for Physics Excellence (APEX) project is led by Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University (AAMU) and includes as core partners the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa (UA-T), Drake State Technical College, the American Association of Physics Teachers/Physics Teaching Resource Agents, and the Huntsville City School system. The partnership also includes supporting partners from the 11 Alabama Math Science and Technology Initiative (AMSTI) regional in-service centers, Madison County Schools, Scottsboro City Schools, Madison City Schools, and the Alabama State Department of Education. The vision of APEX is to promote significant gains in student learning by transforming secondary physics education throughout Alabama. APEX is serving as a comprehensive agent of change by successfully integrating cutting edge teaching practices within secondary physics programs, and it is directly impacting 25% of the physics teachers (with 41,000 students) throughout all Alabama school systems. 

The overarching goal of this project is transformation of the work of pre-service and in-service physics teachers as they gain a deeper content knowledge of physics and also employ effective pedagogical strategies based on physics education research. These teachers go on to apply that knowledge within their own classroom ""action research,"" and this serves as a catalyst to encourage teacher experimentation within their classes - while also encouraging the sharing of these findings with physics teaching colleagues. APEX builds on three components, each with its own subset of goals relating to the overarching project goal. The first component is a physics education center for teacher training that works toward:  (1) increasing the quantity of highly qualified in-service teachers and the number of underrepresented minority pre-service teachers; (2) increasing the depth and breadth of content knowledge, pedagogy, and instructional technology knowledge and skills; (3) promoting the development of the undergraduate physics teacher education programs at AAMU and UA-T; (4) implementing a cyber infrastructure resource repository for sharing and disseminating best teaching practices and lessons learned; and (5) distributing laboratory equipment to schools via the Alabama Science in Motion program. A second component builds on a physics teaching research program to promote and guide action research in the classroom, thus enhancing evidence-based best practices in these Alabama classrooms. The third component is a physics leadership development initiative that works with policy makers and administrators to encourage their broad support of physics teachers and programs. APEX's best practices, lessons learned, and research findings are being disseminated in journals of physics education, as well as being presentated at regional and national STEM education conferences.",NSF,4900,ALABAMA A & M UNIVERSITY,2nd Floor Carnegie Building,Normal,US,Normal,AL05,Alabama A&M University,AL,357620285,47.076,"['Marius  Schamschula', 'Vernessa  Edwards', 'Barbara  Cady', 'Cathy C McNeal Dr.']",09/13/2012,079121448,7999999,09/30/2019,4900,MSP-TARGETED AWARDS,7999999,1238192,079121448,Manmohan D Aggarwal,4900 Meridian St.,Normal,US,Normal,AL05,Alabama A&M University,AL,357620285,mohan.aggarwal@aamu.edu,Manmohan,Aggarwal,D,2563728132,miford@nsf.gov,Michael Ford,7032925153,040106 NSF Education & Human Resource,,,"['Kyle D.

The code will be written to maintain compatibility with the file formats used by the software packages NAMD and VMD, simplifying simulation setup and data analysis.  The resulting simulation engine will be released under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3) and made available to users via the Internet.  

The software tools developed with support from this award will enable high throughput computational screening of materials for CO2 sequestration, improved materials for the stabilization of drug dispersions, and provide molecular level insight to fundamental biological processes such as membrane fusion.  The use of graphics processors for the bulk of the computational effort is expected to provide one to two orders of magnitude reduction in computational time compared to traditional serial, CPU bound code, which will allow for the simulation of systems of greater size and complexity than with existing tools.  The development of the proposed GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulation engine will enhance the cyber-infrastructure of the biology chemistry, chemical engineering, materials science and physics communities.  The GPU-GEMC simulation engine will be promoted through conference presentations at national and international meetings, via a dedicated website, and through publication in peer-reviewed literature.

This award will enhance education at the graduate and undergraduate levels.   Research topics from this work will be integrated into existing courses on GPU computing and molecular simulation.  Graduate and undergraduate students will have the opportunity to work as part of a multidisciplinary team composed of engineers and computer scientists.

While systems containing &gt;100,000 atoms are routinely simulated with molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo simulations are typically limited to systems containing fewer than 5,000 atoms. In addition, there have been significantly fewer development efforts with respect to Monte Carlo codes. Despite the limitations of code availability and lack of parallel capability, the Monte Carlo method continues to see widespread use in science and engineering. In particular, problems requiring an open system (changing number of particles) can only be simulated using Monte Carlo.

This award supported the development of a general purpose Gibbs Ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) simulation engine for molecular systems that uses low-cost graphics processing units (GPU) for parallel computation.   This code allows researchers to predict phase equilibria for a wide variety of substances from knowledge of interactions between atoms in molecules, potentially enabling advances in, for example, the development of new materials for the sequestration of carbon dioxide, and improving our understanding of biological processes, such as membrane fusion.

The majority of the research effort was focused on the development of an open-source, object-oriented C++ code that comprised the core simulation engine.  Algorithms were developed for the efficient parallelization of the calculation of non-bonded Lennard-Jones and electrostatic interactions on the GPU.  The greatest performance enhancements were observed for the calculation of electrostatic energies.   Speedups of over two orders of magnitude were obtained on an NVIDIA K40 compared to identical calculations performed on a single core of an Intel I5-3570 CPU.  Additional support for parallel computation on multicore processors has been included through OpenMP.  The code was written to maintain compatibility with the file formats used by the software packages NAMD and VMD, simplifying simulation setup and data analysis for users.  The resulting simulation engine, known as GPU Optimized Monte Carlo (GOMC), was released under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3) and was made available to the public via a project webpage: http://gomc.eng.wayne.edu and a GitHub repository: https://github.com/GOMC-WSU.

GOMC has a broad feature set and supports simulations in the canonical, isobaric-isothermal, grand canonical and Gibbs ensembles.  GOMC includes histogram-reweighting methods and advanced configurational-bias Monte Carlo methods, such as the coupled-decoupled method.  A variety of all-atom and united-atom force fields based on Lennard-Jones plus point charge potentials are supported, including, for example, CHARMM, OPLS, TraPPE, and the coarse-grained MARTINI.  The code also supports the use of Mie potentials, which offer significant accuracy gains over the Lennard-Jones potential when combined with united-atom models.

GOMC was also used to advance domain science as new functionality was added to the code.  Molecular models for the accurate prediction of vapor-liquid coexistence for noble gases, alkenes, alkynes, and branched alkanes were developed.  Data mining techniques were used to automate components of the parameter optimization process, reducing significantly the amount of human effort needed for model development.  A new heat-mapping technique was created to identify graphically all local and global minima produced by the objective function used in the optimization process.

450,"An Accomplishment-Based Request for Renewal of the Susquehanna - Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (SSHO)

With funding from the NSF Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) program, CZO workers led by PI Susan Brantley and coInvestigator Chris Duffy (Pennsylvania State University) will focus on cross-disciplinary synthesis, data sharing, and outreach at the Susquehanna Shale Hills CZO. Established originally in the 1970s as a site to study water flow in forested catchments, the 8-hectare Shale Hills watershed was expanded in 2007 as a CZO to understand broader questions targeting the interplay of water, energy, atmospheric gases, biota, soils, and the land surface. In addition to the small Shale Hills catchment, the CZO includes a suite of satellite sites that overly the same bedrock type (shale) but which are situated in different climate regimes. One additional satellite site is located on organic-rich Marcellus shale. These satellites allow researchers to understand how climate and organic content control water flow and soil formation while working with minority-and undergrad-serving institutions.  CZO researchers are investigating i) new methodologies to model the age and chemistry of water as it moves from the atmosphere to groundwater; ii) new techniques to synthesize measurements of soil moisture for incorporation into land-atmosphere models; iii) observations that constrain water, energy, and solute fluxes related to trees; iv) models that quantify how soil grows on shale; v) new uses of isotopes to measure soil formation; and vi) observations concerning how variables describing characteristics at depth such as the fracture distribution in bedrock combine with features at Earth's surface such as the sunniness of hillslopes to control the evolution of soils and hillslopes over time. Datasets of isotopes, chemistry, soil moisture, CO2 and energy flux, LiDAR, sapflux, and other observables collected at high spatial and temporal resolution are published online. Outreach activities include community education about natural gas development on shale and K-12 educational opportunities.",NSF,4900,"PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY, THE",110 Technology Center Building,UNIVERSITY PARK,US,University Park,PA05,Pennsylvania State Univ University Park,PA,168027000,47.050,"['Christopher J Duffy', 'David M Eissenstat', 'Eric  Kirby']",08/23/2012,003403953,1000000,08/31/2014,4900,CZO: CRITICAL ZONE OBSER SOLIC,1173108,1239285,003403953,Susan L Brantley,2217 Earth & Engineering Bldg,University Park,US,University Park,PA05,The Pennsylvania State University,PA,168025000,brantley@essc.psu.edu,Susan,Brantley,L,8148651619,ebarrera@nsf.gov,Enriqueta Barrera,7032928551,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) accomplishment-based renewal utilized stable isotope, water and soil chemistry, soil moisture, eddy flux, LiDAR, groundwater, seismic, sapflux and other data to prepare models describing how earth surface processes function.  Students tested how trees influence watershed transpiration, how fractures and macropores affect water flow, how rooting density drives soil thickening and carbon fluxes, how fracture distribution controls landscape evolution, and how temperature and rainfall influence erosion rates. 

Preliminary results indicate that trees in the Shale Hills catchment generally access shallow soil water year round and that patterns of preferential flow and subsurface lateral flow differ on the north and south sides of the catchment.  In addition, the north side of the catchment experiences less recharge than the south side, but has a higher erosional efficiency. Some of our observations are contradictory to observations made at other CZOs in drier climates and we are developing models to explore these differences.

Five research groups outside of the CZO were funded through a competitive seed grant proposal program to complete complementary projects within the CZO.  Key results from these projects include 1) new observations showing how the subsurface structure influences water infiltration (Fig 1), 2) the variation in chemistry of groundwater along flowpaths, and 3) evidence found in swales that document multiple episodes of downslope movement.  The Susquehanna Shale Hills team also continued to reach out to non-scientists in the Pennsylvania commonwealth to teach and learn about water quality issues related to shale gas development in the northern and western parts of the state.

As part of this outreach, we engendered a collaboration between the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute at Penn State and State College Area High School Learning Enrichment Science students.  Students have been introduced to HydroDesktop, a geochemical repository for water quality data, and have participated in water quality measurements. This effort has developed into TeenShale Network (TSN).  During the 2013-2014 academic year, TSN freshmen installed a water quality sensor at a local stream, collected water samples for chemical analyses, measured stream discharge, and ended the year with a student-byline article in the Centre Daily Times (http://www.centredaily.com/2014/05/02/4162016_teen-shale-network-studies-effects.html?rh=1) and a poster presentation at the Annual Shale Network Conference in May 2014 (https://criticalzone.org/shale-hills/news/story/poster-presentation-capstone-for-state-college-teenshalenetwork-spring-2014/).

452,"Graeme Henkelman from the University of Texas at Austin is supported by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods (CTMC) Program and the Office of Cyber Infrastructure (OCI) in developing algorithms for accelerating molecular dynamics simulations. For rare event systems, such as diffusion in solids and reactions at surfaces, transition state theory (TST) allows for a separation of time scales between that of molecular vibrations and the reactive events of interest. When reactive mechanisms are not known, an adaptive version of the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method is used to find saddle points and rates are evaluated with harmonic TST.  To reduce the computational cost, a database is employed to store kinetic events and to make them available for later use in separate calculations with similar chemistry. When the reaction mechanisms for a class of system are known, the computational cost is low because all events are drawn from the database. To further accelerate the simulations, groups of states connected by fast rates are escaped using an analytic solution to the master equation. Storing the local connectivity of these states is essential for efficiency.  Accuracy will be improved with a set of methods ranging from harmonic TST to the (classically) exact full TST plus dynamical corrections. The challenge of TST is finding a dividing surface that separates reactants from any product state. A support vector machine is being developed to provide an analytic classification function based upon learned data.  Sampled points around the decision surface will be used to train the machine so that it can provide an accurate transition state without prior knowledge of reaction mechanisms.

This work is directed at alleviating the ultralong computational times needed for simulation of realistic chemical or material processes, e.g., catalysis, protein folding, molecular diffusion and so on.  The characteristic times for basic molecular motion are many, many times faster than the time scales we measure in the laboratory, and so acceleration algorithms must be developed.  EON2 is being developed as a distributed open-source program developed by the PI and collaborators to calculate long-timescale molecular dynamics in systems, for example, undergoing catalys and clustering on metal substrates.  It will use advanced database techniques and machine learning, and will be usable in conjunction with other software through customized interfaces.

Goldfield,7032922173,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The outcome of this project was the development of the adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo (AKMC) method for modeling the long time state-to-state dynamics of atomic systems, as well as new methods for transition state finding and accelerated molecular dynamics that go beyond the harmonic (saddle point) approximation to transition state theory.  Specific outcomes are:


1) Basin constrained kappa-dimer:  For AKMC simulations, the goal is to find all low energy reaction mechanisms that lead from a reactant state. A requirement for a saddle to contribute to the escape rate from a state is that it is on the boundary of the state.  One problem with the dimer min-mode following method is that it can find disconnected saddles even when initiated well within the initial state.  The source of the problem is that the dimer method is sensitive to local ridges, where the gradient is perpendicular to the lowest curvature mode. These local ridges, however, can deviate from the true ridge, defined by the boundary of points which minimize to the initial state. In the kappa-dimer approach, a second local measure of the true ridge is introduced, the isocontour curvature, kappa.  Near the minimum, contour lines curve towards the minimum and near ridges they curve away.  The kappa=0 surface does not cross the true ridge except at the saddles.  Restraining the dimer to the kappa&lt;0 region eliminates the problem of disconnected saddles, as well as reducing the number of force evaluations required to find connected saddles in high dimensional systems.

2) Transition State Finding Benchmarks: A benchmark webpage, www.optbench.org, provides a set of standardized benchmarks that anyone with atomic optimization or transition state finding codes can compare to. The use of subversion machinery allows contributors to add their code and data to the benchmarks repository for comparison with other codes, as well as automatic updates of the webpage. Our community has long discussed the need for such benchmark systems, and it is exciting to have some momentum behind this project including several groups. This work represents a collaboration with the Wales group at Cambridge University, and the J&oacute;nsson group at the University of Iceland.


3) Dynamics of a solid-solid phase transition in molybdenum: The A15 to BCC phase transition in molybdenum is modeled at the atomic scale.  At room temperature, the transition of atomic layers occurs in microseconds.  Since this time scale is inaccessible by classical molecular dynamics, the kinetics were followed using the adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo approach. Initially, a disordered region forms between the crystalline phases.  Phase boundary migration was found to involve hundreds of states within the disordered region.  An effective layer transition barrier of 0.5~eV was determined as a collective property of the complex potential energy surface.


4) Ridge-based hyperdynamics: A powerful way to accelerate rare events in molecular dynamics simulations is to apply a bias potential which destabilizes minima without biasing the transitions between stable states.  This approach, called hyperdynamics, is limited by our ability to construct general bias potentials without having to understand the reaction mechanisms available to the system.  A common problem with current bias potentials is that their effectiveness decreases rapidly with system size.  We attribute this problem to a diminishing volume defined by the metrics around a reactant minimum as compared to the total volume of the reactant state basin.  Here we defined a bias potential based upon the distance to the boundary of the reactant basin, quantified in two ways: (i) by following the minimum mode direction up the ridge of the potential surface and (ii) by training a machine learning algorithm to give an analytic expression for the boundary to which the distance can be calculated.  Both of these ridge-based bias potentials are demonstrated to scale qualitatively better with dimensionality than existing methods.  We attribute this difference to a greater filling fraction of the reactant state using the ridge-based bias potentials as compared to the standard potentials.


5) Analytic approximation of anharmonic corrections to TST:  It is well known that TST can overestimate reaction rates due to the recrossing of trajectories through the transition state. The theory that we developed correctly accounts for this recrossing based upon how the curvatures of the potential change near the transition state, and provides a simple analytic correction factor to TST.  This correction is demonstrated to be accurate and efficient in that it can be evaluated along with harmonic TST rates with little additional computational cost.  Specifically, using perturbation theory we solve the equations of motion in the neighborhood of the transition state and derive a simple condition that determines whether a trajectory is truly reactive or not. We apply our theory to adatom diffusion on an aluminum surface and show that our analytical results compare well with those of a direct dynamical simulation.

453,"Software is a critical element in a wide range of real-world applications. Attacks against computer software can cause substantial damage to the cyber-infrastructure of our modern society and economy. In fact, many new software security vulnerabilities are discovered on a daily basis. Therefore, it is vital to identify and resolve those security issues as early as possible. This research aims to investigate a scientific foundation and a novel methodology for automated detection, prevention, and resolution of prior-known software security vulnerabilities in software systems. The results will help to detect and prevent prior-known security vulnerabilities from recurring in other software systems.
 
In this research, the key philosophy is that the software systems having the same/similar software security vulnerabilities share the protocols, algorithms, procedures, libraries, frameworks, modules, or source code with the same flaws, and they suffer the same/similar exploitation mechanisms. Based on that, empirical studies are conducted to investigate the nature and the characteristics of recurring software vulnerabilities in different software systems, and to validate that hypothesis. Based on the knowledge gained from the studies, new vulnerability models, representations, and similarity measurements are developed to capture recurring software security vulnerabilities, and the corresponding vulnerable code and exploitation mechanisms. Novel algorithms and techniques are designed to (semi-)automatically build graph-based vulnerability models from vulnerability reports and from vulnerable code and patches, aiming to construct a database of prior-known vulnerabilities. A new methodology is developed to help to identify the prior-known vulnerabilities in other systems and to suggest the resolution. Specifically, the automated methods and advances include 1) an algorithm to compare and match against vulnerability models in the database, 2) a technique to map software concepts between security reports and from a report to the corresponding source code fragments, modules, or components; 3) an algorithm to determine the modules and source file locations in the new system that correspond to the vulnerable modules and locations in a system with a prior-known vulnerability; and 4) a technique to suggest the patch to the new system from the prior fixes. In brief, the results of this research help to resolve early software security vulnerabilities. They will lead to more reliable software because the process of detecting and patching for recurring security vulnerabilities will be more efficient and effective.",NSF,4900,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,1138 Pearson,AMES,US,Ames,IA04,Iowa State University,IA,500112207,47.070,,08/13/2012,005309844,479446,01/31/2017,4900,Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace,192722,1223828,005309844,Tien N Nguyen,Coover Hall,Ames,US,Ames,IA04,Iowa State University,IA,500112207,nguyen.n.tien@gmail.com,Tien,Nguyen,N,9728833893,sgreensp@nsf.gov,Sol J.

454,"This project aims to build large scale distributed syntactic, semantic, and lexical language models that are trained by corpora with up to Web-scale data on a supercomputer in order to substantially improve the performance of machine translation and speech recognition systems.  It is conducted under the directed Markov random field paradigm to integrate both topics and syntax to form complex distributions for natural language, and uses hierarchical Pitman-Yor processes to model long-tail properties of natural language.  By exploiting this particular structure, the complex statistical estimation and inference algorithms are decomposed and performed in a distributed environment.  The language models are put into one-pass decoders of machine translation systems, and the lattice rescoring decoder into a speech recognition system.  In addition, a principled solution to a long-standing open problem, smoothing fractional counts due to latent variables in Kneser-Ney's sense, might be found. 

This project fits into the NSF's strategic long term vision of a Cyber-infrastructure Framework for 21st Century Science and Engineering (CIF21).

Experiments on several data sets show that the new method achieves perplexity and BLEU score results comparable to the best existing methods, while only using a tiny fraction of the parameters required by other approaches. We investigated using a distributive composite statistical language model (CLM) in speech recognition to reduce word error rate through re-scoring word lattices, confusion networks, and n&shy;-best lists. Finally we developed a novel approach of ensemble neural language modeling to integrate lexical, syntactical, and semantic language phenomena through multiple word/class factorizations and direct word error rate minimization.

The proposed models are scalable and improve the performance of the state-of-the-art speech recognition and machine translation systems. The techniques developed in this project might not only lead to effective, robust and intelligent language technology applications, but also might be extended and applied to solve problems in computational biology and computer vision.

455,"The University of Wisconsin-Madison is awarded a CAREER grant to support Laurence Lowe in his research to extend rigorous mathematical simulation methods and make them available in a user-friendly model description language designed to solve computationally challenging forward simulation problems in biology. Many user-friendly simulation tools have been developed in systems biology, but their underlying mathematical representation impairs their use for important problems in genetics and ecology. This project will transform quantitative modeling into a mainstream activity that will be an integral part of biological research in the future. The first task will be to implement a new language that makes it easy to read and write such models for humans and for computers. To harness the large-scale computing power needed for analyzing complicated models, a link will be built to the evolution@home public global computing system and to private Condor pools. To efficiently store the results produced, a new standard for storing and sharing simulation results will be pioneered. The second goal will be to address combinatorial explosions in genetics and ecology models with algorithms and representations that work efficiently with both systems biology and genetics simulations, and that also allow for distributions of event times other than the standard assumption (exponential). Finally, the project will apply these new tools to intensely studied biological systems, including growth of VSV viruses in cells and adaptive evolutionary ecology of copepods (important zooplankton food source for fish). Close collaborations with neighboring labs will help shape the development of tools to ensure the resulting cyber-infrastructure is useful for cutting edge research. Such research is pivotal for increasing the quantitative rigor, realism and accuracy represented in models that will become increasingly important for various decision support systems.

The same language and simulation tools developed for research will be used to teach graduate and undergraduate students, and design innovative teaching materials that improve the understanding of quantitative modeling for diverse audiences. Using ""the real thing"" is fascinating and transformational for learning, as witnessed by the rise of ""R"" in statistics. Working with K12 teachers, materials will be developed that explain the importance of good models to a broad audience. To this end, a brief interactive course with comprehension tests will be implemented to impart basic modeling knowledge, encourage responsible use of models, and discourage abuse. Successful completion of the course will provide a ""License for Using Models"". This and other teaching tools will be developed and tested on K12 students and evolution@home participants. The latter contribute CPU power to simulations of evolution and have a natural interest in models they are simulating, an interest to be met by an engaging website.

456,"For nearly a century, researchers have studied the pond-dwelling ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena, making numerous fundamental discoveries in cell and molecular biology, including two that won Nobel prizes. To maintain its position as a premier model organism, Tetrahymena needs well-developed and maintained genomic resources. Remarkably, Tetrahymena houses two distinct nuclei with distinct genomes 'one germline and one somatic' within its single cell. Over five years ago, the somatic genome was sequenced and annotated, revealing about 25,000 genes. Although the data have been invaluable to Tetrahymena researchers, the genome assembly and many of the gene models are flawed or incomplete (as is typical of such draft-level projects). Using transcriptomic and comparative genomic data obtained from other sources, this project will perform much needed repairs to the essential genomic resources. In addition, the germline genome sequence has just now become available. This project will explore the structure of the germline genome, how it is related to the somatic genome to which it gives rise in development , and ways in which both genomes have changed over the course of evolution. 

Broader Impact: These data will be used to update and enhance the resources and functionalities of the Tetrahymena Genome Database, serving a wide community of researchers and thus providing a strong broader impact to the cyber-infrastructure of science. This community also takes very seriously its commitment to the integration of research and education. The project will provide laboratory and bioinformatic experience to graduate and undergraduate students.

Researchers have studied this organism for decades, making many notable discoveries including two that resulted in Nobel prizes.  The best known of these is the discovery of the mechanism by which the ends of our chromosomes are maintained throughout life, a consequence of the unique life cycle of this organism.  Tetrahymena  contains two separate nuclei, the micronucleus and the macronucleus. The DNA of the micronucleus is passed on during sexual reproduction, as in most organisms, but during development of the other (macro) nucleus, its DNA is spliced up and edited to remove parts that are not essential for the function of genes. The result is hundreds of mini-chromosomes consisting primarily of coding gene information. This project greatly expanded our knowledge of Tetrahymena by generating and/or improving complete genome sequences of both types of nucleus, mapping the functional features of the genomes, and comparing the features of several other Tetrahymena species. The information generated is vital to future research with Tetrahymena, and therefore, dissemination to a wide audience through a dedicated, user-friendly, web-based genome database was an integral part of the project. In addition, the research provided valuable research experiences to undergraduate and graduate students at all the participating institutions.

457,"Intellectual Merit: Replication of chromosomal DNA is accomplished by a dynamic protein assembly termed the replisome. Processivity clamps such as Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) are important constituents of the replisome that ensure processive replication. Sliding clamps also act as versatile scaffolds in the recruitment of cell-cycle control and DNA repair proteins and are engaged in almost every aspect of DNA metabolism. Their remarkable ring-shaped architecture allows them to topologically encircle and slide along DNA. To fulfill their varied functions, the clamps have to strike a delicate balance between stability and the ability to open in order to be loaded onto DNA. Processivity clamps are opened and resealed at DNA primer-template junctions by the action of a clamp loader in a cycle involving ATP binding and hydrolysis. The project aims to delineate the detailed mechanisms for processivity clamp opening, determine the role of the clamp loader and describe the utilization of ATP during each step of the clamp loading cycle.  Atomistic models for the intermediates in the cycle will be constructed to describe the conformational transitions leading to clamp opening and reclosing. This project will achieve a unified molecular-level description of the clamp loading processes and provide insight into clamp-associated activities and their essential roles in duplication of the genome and the regulation of genome fidelity. 

Broader Impact: This project will substantially impact our knowledge of the biological mechanisms controlling genetic integrity with broad implications for biotechnology, environmental and bioenergy research. The project blends new methodologies and novel applications to create a multidisciplinary research and education program that is interesting and challenging for students of all levels. In particular, students will be introduced to a broad arsenal of theoretical methods, molecular modeling algorithms and High Performance Computing (HPC) architectures. Curricular innovation would involve development of a new module (advanced sampling, QM/MM and AIMD methods) for a graduate-level Computational Chemistry class at Georgia State University (GSU) and the introduction of Advanced Modeling seminars for the computational chemistry center at GSU. Additionally, molecular visualization will be used as an effective tool in attracting high school students to STEM fields with an emphasis on bringing students from disadvantaged backgrounds to the GSU campus.

Sliding clamp proteins have multiple subunits that come together to form characteristic rings around duplex DNA. The rings can slide along DNA and serve as mobile platforms for the assembly of core replication complexes. Therefore, these versatile molecular actors are key for the maintenance of genomic integrity in the face of spontaneous or environmental DNA damage. Clamps are also at the very heart of many essential cellular activities ranging from chromatin structure maintenance, chromosome segregation, cell-cycle progression to apoptosis. Examining fundamental biological mechanisms and dynamic protein associations of sliding clamp proteins formed the basis of our NSF project. Specifically, we delineated how sliding clamps from different organisms open and re-close during the cycle of clamp loading, explained the origins of clamp subunit interface stability, and, for the first time, determined the molecular forces necessary to load sliding clamps on DNA. We also carried out extensive comparative analysis of clamps from bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic organisms - an effort which revised our understanding of clamp subunit interface interactions and the mechanisms of clamp loading. In addition, the NSF award also allowed us to publish in the broader area of molecular modeling of protein assemblies important for genome duplication and gene expression. Notably, working with experimental (cryo-EM) collaborators allowed us for the first time to decipher in atomic detail the three-dimensional layout of human RNA Polymerase II transcription preinitiation complexes. Understanding replication and transcription is of fundamental significance. For instance, replication of microbial genomes and metabolic responses to environmental stresses such as ultraviolet radiation, ionizing radiation, toxic metal ion concentrations and oxidative stress are of direct relevance to environmental research. Fundamental knowledge of the replication mechanisms that operate in different organisms could inform diverse areas of application in biotechnology, biomass production, microbial cell biology and environmental remediation.
In terms of broader impacts, the NSF award has aided our efforts to expose students and trainees from all backgrounds to cutting-edge computational science. 6 Ph.D. students, 4 M.S. students, 3 postdocs and 16 undergraduates received research training during the period of this award. Group members were trained in the use of modern cyber-infrastructure, introduced to the concepts, algorithms and tools of high performance computing and data-driven computational science, and shown how to apply these tools to problems relevant to biology. I also led efforts to increase the retention and success of students from groups traditionally underserved by higher education by offering high-quality research experiences in computational science.

Within the next 4 decades, demand for food and fuel is expected to double along with a more than 50% increase in demand for clean water. Understanding, predicting and managing land use and associated economic services, while mitigating and adapting to rapid climate change, is now one of the most pressing societal challenges of the 21st century. The international CZ science community addressed science questions related to these challenges at an international workshop, convened November 9th-11th, 2011 at the University of Delaware, USA. The workshop attendees outlined specific CZ science advances that will be necessary, and documented the links between basic science advances in Earth surface processes and the global sustainability agenda. The overarching hypothesis is that accelerating changes in land use, atmospheric composition and climate are forcing rapid and profound changes in the continental surface that require an unprecedented intensity and scale of scientific observation and new knowledge to guide intervention. Six priority science questions were identified and organized according to the time scale over which the processes occur, and are listed below.
&bull; Long-Term Processes and Impacts
1. How has the geological evolution of the CZ established ecosystem function and its sustainability?
2. How do molecular-scale interactions dictate processes in soils and underlying rock, and influence the development of watersheds and aquifers as functional geophysical units?
3. How can theory and data be combined from molecular- to global- scales in order to interpret past transformations of Earth's surface and forecast CZ evolution and its planetary impact?
&bull; Short-Term Processes and Impacts
4. What controls the resilience, response and recovery of the CZ to perturbations such as climate and land use changes, and how can this be quantified through observations and predicted through mathematical modelling?
5. How can sensing and monitoring technology, e/cyber-infrastructure and modelling methods be integrated to enable the simulation of essential terrestrial variables and forecasting for water supplies, food production, biodiversity and other major benefits for humankind?
6. How can theory, data and mathematical models from the natural- and social- sciences be integrated to simulate, value, and manage Critical Zone goods and services?
Critical Zone Observatories (CZOs) are research field sites that provide a major international capability to advance the new knowledge that is required for sustainable management of the CZ. Some common features of current CZOs are a wide range of multidisciplinary expertise that is concentrated in order to deliver transformative science advances; a focus on process studies that are hypothesis driven; and a combination of observations at multiple scales with mathematical modelling and simulation. The USA CZOs are developing advances in sensor technology and real-time data acquisition, integrated with data management, across a range of temporal scales. European CZOs are driving forward integration of science advances with social sciences and policy, and development of decision support tools for policy and management intervention.
The role of CZOs is growing in international impact; they are providing scientific focal points to define the major research questions and drawing together the critical mass of disciplines and talent to rapidly deliver solutions to major societal challenges. This development offers enormous potential for research within international networks of CZOs located along global gradients of environmental change; e.g. in land use and climate.

Intellectual Merit:: In this collaborative project we focussed on the synthesis, study, and understanding of organized assemblies of redox molecular units, in which the redox centers are situated within a few nanometers of each other. The goal of this work is to elucidate the physical and chemical principles that Nature uses when organizing redox active units to perform various biochemical functions.  We used nucleic acids (NAs) to organize the redox active units in space, because they have a well-defined structure and can be synthetically modified in a straightforward manner. These properties allow us to place the various molecular units with precision and to control the charge and chirality of the final assemblies.  We studied the movement of electrons through these  structures, either by applying a voltage with an electrode or by exciting one of the molecular units with light. Quantum mechanical theories were used to explain the experimental results.  This  project combined the expertise of a synthetic bioinorganic chemist, an experimental physical chemist, and a theoretical chemist.

Conductance versus charge transfer. We examined how the nature of the experiment affects the results and the mechanism of the charge transfer through the molecule.  In particular, we compared measurements in which the two ends of the molecule are connected to electrodes (a molecular conductance measurement) to the case in which only one end is connected to an electrode and the other end has a molecular unit that can accept an electron (an electron transfer rate measurement).  Then we examined whether the current measured in the conductance experiment is correlated with the rate constant in the rate measurement. We examined this dependence for different types of molecules and different lengths of related molecules.  In contrast to the predictions of the simplest theoretical models, we found that the conductance and the rate constant display a power-law relationship for a given class of molecules, and a lack of correlation when a diverse group of molecules is compared. These experiments led us to create a more sophisticated theoretical model that can explain the power- law relations. This new theoretical model provides insight into the mechanism by which the electrons move through the molecules and makes predictions as to how we should expect the conductance and rate constants to be correlated for other types of molecules.

The effect of molecular rigidity on charge transfer. In this study we prepared two different types of nucleic acid structures (aeg-PNA and gamma-methylated PNA) that are structurally similar but have different rigidities;the flexibility of the aeg-PNA is much larger than that of the gamma-methylated PNA. The structural similarity and the different flexibility were shown by us and others in earlier studies.  We used  electrochemistry to measure the charge transfer rates and found that the  rate through aeg-PNA is twice the rate through the gamma-PNA. In concert with the experimental measurements, we performed quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics calculations to reveal that the difference in the charge transfer rate can be related to differences in the extent of the molecular fluctuations. In particular, fluctuations of the nucleic acid backbone affect the local electric field, which in turn broadens the energy levels that are involved in the electronsÆ transit through the molecule.  In some conventional descriptions of electron transfer, fluctuations act to lower the charge transfer rate; this has led us to develop a new theoretical model that accounts for the role of fluctuations explicitly and reveals that a new mechanism can manifest itself under the right conditions.

We then studied the movement of electrons through the nucleic acid structures, either by applying a voltage with an electrode or by exciting one of the molecular units in the assembly with light.  Quantum mechanical theories were used to explain the measurements.  

Two major achievements are described below:

Conductance versus charge transfer. We examined whether the nature of the experiment affects our interpretation of the results and the mechanism of the charge transfer through the molecule. In particular, we compared measurements in which the two ends of the molecule are connected to electrodes (a molecular conductance measurement) to the case in which only one end is connected to an electrode and the other end has a molecular unit that can accept an electron (an electron transfer rate measurement). Then we examined quantitatively whether the current measured in the conductance experiment is correlated with the rate constant in the rate measurement. We examined this effect for different types of molecules and different lengths of related molecules. In contrast to the predictions of the simplest theoretical models, we found that the conductance and the rate constant display a power-law relationship for a given class of molecules, and a lack of correlation when a diverse group of molecules is compared. These experiments led us to create a more sophisticated theoretical model that can explain the power- law relations and this new theoretical model provides insight into the mechanism by which the electrons move through the molecules and makes predictions as to how we should expect the conductance and rate constants to be correlated for other types of molecules.

The effect of molecular rigidity on charge transfer.  In this study we prepared two different types of nucleic acid structures (aeg-PNA and gamma-methylated PNA) that are structurally very similar but have different rigidities; i.e., the flexibility of the aeg-PNA is much larger than that of the gamma-methylated PNA. The structural similarity and the different flexibility were shown by us and others in earlier studies. We used electrochemistry to measure the charge transfer rates and found that the rate through aeg-PNA is twice the rate through the gamma-PNA. In concert with the experimental measurements, we performed quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics calculations to reveal that the difference in the charge transfer rate can be related to differences in the extent of the molecular fluctuations. In particular, fluctuations of the nucleic acid backbone affect the local electric field, which in turn broadens the energy levels that are involved in the electronsÆ transit through the molecule. In some conventional descriptions of electron transfer, fluctuations act to lower the charge transfer rate; this has led us to develop a new theoretical model that accounts for the role of fluctuations explicitly and reveals that a new mechanism can manifest itself under the right conditions.

Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) building blocks that contain electroactive units will be used, together with complementary nucleic acids (DNA or PNA) as a template for the building blocks, to self-assemble and form preprogrammed electroactive assemblies. The key feature of the proposed research is the general and modular approach to incorporate inorganic or organic charge transfer components at predefined spatial locations in a nucleic acid-based structural scaffold. The team of researchers with complementary expertise (synthesis, characterization, and theory) will collaborate to define the synthetic methodologies, to develop the predictive models, and to quantify the structure and the function of these novel electroactive, supramolecular structures. The broader impacts of this collaborative research program originate from: (1) the creation of new paradigms for charge transfer, (2) the creation of new pedagogical tools for science education that make use of cyber-infrastructure, and (3) outreach activities that enhance diversity in the STEM workforce.

In this collaborative project we focused on the synthesis, study, and understanding of organized assemblies of redox molecular units situated within a few nanometers of each other. The goal is to elucidate the physical and chemical principles that Nature uses when organizing redox active units to perform various biochemical functions. We used peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) to organize the redox active units in space because they have a well-defined structure and can be synthetically modified in a relatively straightforward manner.  These properties allow us to place the various molecular units with precision and to control the charge and chirality of the final assemblies. We then studied the movement of electrons through the nucleic acid structures, either by applying a voltage with an electrode or by exciting one of the molecular units in the assembly with light.  Quantum mechanical theories were used to explain the measurements.

This project combined the expertise of a synthetic bioinorganic chemist, an experimental physical chemist, and a theoretical chemist. Two major achievements obtained during the grant period are briefly described.

462,"The XIX International Conference on Computational Methods in Water Resources will be held June 17-21, 2012, on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  This biennial series of meetings has served as the premier venue for engineers, geoscientists, hydrologists, computer scientists and applied mathematicians to present and discuss their latest research.  The increase in raw computational power, software developments, availability of on-line hydrologic data, and recent advances in cyber-infrastructure make this a particularly exciting time for computational applications to water resources and geoscience challenges.  The conference will serve as a unique forum to bring together those from the computer science/applied math community who work in methods and tools with those from engineering, geoscience, government and industry who are responsible for addressing pressing water-related problems.  Topics of pressing societal relevance being emphasized in special sessions include: climate change impacts on hydrology, river mechanics, circulation in coastal oceans, ecohydrology, contaminant transport in surface water and groundwater, and geological sequestration of carbon dioxide.

NSF support will allow undergraduate and graduate students to register at a reduced rate, thereby facilitating participation by students.  Students and post-docs will benefit from the opportunity to present their work at a major international conference. The conference will foster interactions among those from academia, government, and industry, and will also enhance international exchange.  At the last meeting in the United States, approximately 40% of the participants were international, representing more than 20 countries.  Students and other conference attendees will have the opportunity to interact with the distinguished plenary speakers, who represent a diverse international group that includes both senior and mid-career scholars.

CMWR 2012 was held at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on June 17-21, 2012.  NSF funds were used to support a part of the travel and lodging expenses of the distinguished keynote speakers, and also to allow students to register at a special reduced rate.  

Based upon overall attendance, the conference was a great success.  There were 320 total attendees, which included approximately 110 students and 120 non-US participants representing 28 countries.  Registration surpassed that of prior recent meetings in Barcelona (~ 240) and San Francisco (~ 270).  There was a deliberate attempt to reach out to new communities of scholars, as represented by special sessions on ""Data-driven Approaches for Water Resources Forecasting and Knowledge Discovery,""  ""Computational Ecohydrology,"" and ""Modeling and Analytics for Hydrologic Impact Assessments due to Climate Change.""  A complete list of special sessions and other information is posted on the conference web site:  http://cmwr2012.cee.illinois.edu.  The conference proceedings are also available on-line at the web site.

In addition to invited talks by distinguished scholars (see the web site for a complete list), the conference opened with  a special plenary session that honored the career and contributions of Dr. George Pinder.  A distinguished group of Dr. PinderÆs colleagues and former students gave presentations, including Linda Abriola, Mike Celia, David Ahlfeld, William Gray, and Rien van Genuchten.  Dr. Pinder is one of the founding figures in application of computational methods to problems of fluid flow in the subsurface, and he was a co-founder of the CMWR conference series which started in 1976 at Princeton University.  Dr. Pinder is an alumni of the University of Illinois Department of Geology, and he was also given the Distinguished Alumni Award at the start of the plenary session.

 Another special feature of the conference was a tour of the National Petascale Computing Facility (also known as ""The Blue Waters Project"").  Blue Waters is supported by the National Science Foundation and the University of Illinois, and will be the most powerful supercomputer available to the US academic research community when it is completed later in 2012.

The primary element in the internship program is a Networking Fundamentals course over a 10-week period using inquiry-based learning techniques. The program also includes weekly seminars and working internships in operational environments at Indiana University leveraging their roles in campus, national and global network operations and monitoring. Student recruitment will emphasize EPSCoR jurisdictions. Student surveys will be used to evaluate the program?s effectiveness. The activities leverage an existing network engineering relationship between Indiana University and the University of Montana in which 2 students from Montana interned with Indiana?s GlobalNOC.

The project was a success, in that the internship program was held each of the two targeted summers, all slots were filled, and Montana sent students as intended (2 the first summer, 3 the second).  Feedback from all participants, including the Montana students, indicated that this was a unique opportunity for them to get real world exposure to the realities of network operation in an internationally reknown NOC. In terms of internship logistics, the major outcomes were re-enforcement of two features known in advance: (a) the difficulty of creating and managing both the educational and project activities central to the internship for a large (about 20 overall) and diverse collection of students; and (b) the importance to students of making this a unique training experience AND a program fiscally competitive with other summer opportunities (e.g. summer programming jobs).  Both of these aspects highlight the importance of gathering external support in a variety of foms from a variety of sources to sustain such a program.  The forms range from financial contributions which increase stipends available to students, to providing practicing professionals to do guest lectures, to providing representative problems students can work on for their project component, to interacting with students following their internship to reinforce what they have learned and done. In Montana we have been able to begin attracting outside support of various types from the local telcommunications industry and other federal agencies with a major presence in this region.  We are now working with the IU-GRNOC to find ways to continue and expand this as an on-ging summer program.

464,"Location is a type of information that can be used by various applications to provides new opportunities for business and commercial success, and at the same time may be misused. This proposed research aims at developing a multi-model architecture with privacy-enhancing techniques for countering location spoofing attacks while respecting location privacy of mobile users. The multi-model architecture promotes the parallel use of alternative positioning models and multi-beacon methods to make it harder to launch consistent location spoofing attacks. A pseudo-identity obfuscation technique is incorporated into the multi-model defense architecture based on mobility-aware mix-zones to address the legal, social, and ethical implications of continuous location verifications. In this technique, mobile users may customize the settings of mix-zones in order to meet their personalized privacy preference.

The intellectual merit of the proposed research includes a transformative approach that advocates privacy-aware and customizable defense architecture and algorithms to detect and filter out compromised mobile nodes. This detection and filtering is based on the amount of inconsistency between the client-claimed location and the system-determined location as well as the amount of inconsistency among multiple beacons. The broader impacts of this research are two-fold. First, the development of a systematic and privacy enhancing approach for countering location spoofing threats will help enabling a wide range of subscription-driven location based services, such as location-based advertisements, location-based content dissemination and billing, and location-based entertainment. Second, the technical results and the proof-of-concept prototype will be disseminated to a broader audience through educational activities and involvement of women and minority in the proposed research.

The main outcome in this year includes two original developments:
(1) The StarCloak system is a utility-aware and attack resilient approach to privacy preserving location queries for mobile travelers on road networks. It addresses the two known problems associated with the existing solutions: (1) the loss of location utility, such as the increased query cost associated with using spatial cloaked location, and (2) the vulnerability against background knowledge based spoofing and replay attacks, preventing wide deployment of privacy preserving location query systems. StarCloak can effectively integrate spatial and temporal location utility constraint, anonymous query processing cost, and complex location inference attacks with high query cost-efficiency and strong attack resilience for scaling anonymous location queries. StarCloak is novel in three aspects: (a) StarCloak incorporates spatial and temporal location utility constraints as an integral part of its location anonymization model, ensuring the query utility of anonymized locations. (b) The privacy-preserving location query algorithms in StarCloak strives to minimize the additional end-to-end latency introduced due to anonymous query processing. (c) StarCloak embeds robust defense capability in its location anonymization to protect spatially cloaked locations against sophisticated attacks based on background knowledge, such as correlation based replay attacks and query injection based attacks.
(2) The development of differential location privacy optimizations to address the inherent problems in existing main stream location obfuscation mechanisms. Concretely, geo-indistinguishability and expected inference error are two popular privacy notions that define location privacy from different perspectives, each notion has its individual strength in the context of protecting location privacy. This work proposes a location obfuscation mechanism that dynamically combines both privacy notions by utilizing the implicit relationships between two notions. This mechanism performs location obfuscation dynamically and adaptively, taking into account both adversary?s current prior knowledge and mobile users? specific privacy requirements at different locations and times. Evaluation using real-world datasets demonstrates that this mechanism can efficiently guarantee location privacy in terms of two privacy notions simultaneously.
We are working on public release of these two systems and technical papers produced under both developments are under submission.

465,"1140152 (Shonnard).  This award is funded under NSF's Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability (SEES) activities, which aim to address the challenges of creating a sustainable world.  This project will establish a network of science and engineering researchers in North, Central and South America to share knowledge and cooperate on research into the implications of large-scale biofuels production in the Americas. The potential impact of large-scale biofuels and bioenergy production on environmental systems and social conditions is largely unknown. Yet despite this lack of fundamental sustainability knowledge, there currently is a rapid movement toward the development of biofuels and bioenergy production systems that will likely lead to dramatic changes in human and natural systems. These changes may be beneficial or detrimental, and may involve a number of inter-related issues such as land ownership and management, creation of new employment opportunities, occupational safety, unforeseen transportation and logistical challenges, impacts on water availability and quality, and potentially many other changes to social and environmental systems.  This network of researchers will tackle these important issues through cooperative research, education, and outreach programs, leading to new knowledge of relevance to decision-makers in business, government, academia, and other organizations.  

The Pan American Biofuels and Bioenergy Sustainability RCN will consist of researchers at universities and other organizations from North America (United States, Canada and Mexico), Central America, and South America. The main biofuels and bioenergy sustainability research themes will be a. land rights, b. water/energy nexus issues, c. biodiversity/ecosystems d. energy policy, e. life cycle environmental assessment, f. food and other systems, g. biogeochemical cycles, and h. biomass supply transportation logistics. This RCN will have two main deliverables; 1. a research roadmap report on sustainability of biofuels and bioenergy in the Pan American region, and 2. a graduate course in sustainability of biofuels/bioenergy to be developed within the network and disseminated to the network through the internet. The students taking this graduate course will emerge with a high-level understanding of a range of sustainability issues for biofuels/bioenergy systems in different political, geographic, and societal contexts in the Pan American region. Lectures will be developed and delivered by content experts from the many participating institutions using an active-learning format where students are required to analyze case studies and lead class room discussions. A series of annual workshops and a major mid-project conference will be the primary means of delivering on these project outcomes. The RCN will be connected through a comprehensive cyber-infrastructure based upon the HubZeroTM platform to support real time dissemination of the RCN products, enable real time collaboration across the network, and provide for the growth of the proposed RCN.",NSF,4900,MICHIGAN TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY,1400 Townsend Drive,Houghton,US,Houghton,MI01,Michigan Technological University,MI,499311295,47.041,"['B D Solomon', 'Richard P Donovan', 'Kathleen E Halvorsen', 'Samuel R Sweitz']",08/05/2011,065453268,749996,12/31/2016,4900,CR-Water Sustainability & Clim,819996,1140152,065453268,David R Shonnard,,,US,Houghton,MI01,Michigan Technological University,MI,499311295,drshonna@mtu.edu,David,Shonnard,R,9064873468,bhamilto@nsf.gov,Bruce K.

466,"This demonstration project is creating and evaluating a set of activities aimed at preparing a diverse science and engineering workforce with cyberinfrastructure knowledge and skills. A multidisciplinary team of faculty and undergraduate students is collaborating with citizen scientist end users to develop and deploy data collection and visualization tools, to monitor the critical ecosystems of Lightfoot Bay in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The program is building upon existing educational programs at Michigan Technological University, Keweenaw Bay Ojibwa Community College, several local high schools, and a local land conservancy. Research scientists at International Business Machines (IBM) who are actively engaged in the development of crowd sensing applications are collaborating with the co-PIs and students. 

Intellectual Merit 
Sensor-enabled smartphones are serving as the primary platform for acquiring, analyzing and disseminating environmental information. In this demonstration project the team is developing and using smartphone applications to acquire digital images, in-situ measurements of water quality parameters, and personal narratives. The project is developing applications for transferring the acquired data synchronously or asynchronously to an interactive website through which citizen scientists will interact with professional scientists. Inspired by the popular concept of the internet, the project focuses on end-to-end engagement that not only collects data but provides for a compelling creative visualization environment through which users combine quantitative data in meaningful ways while framing and/or annotating it with qualitative data. The smartphone applications and interactive data displays are developed in existing computer science classes, driving significant, sustainable enhancements in their curricula. High school, community college, and undergraduate students are testing the applications in the field and the data visualization site and are providing feedback to the developers. These activities are offered through existing general science, environmental science and engineering, and social studies and science courses and will be sustained beyond the project period by training the teachers to deploy smartphone applications and interactive data displays. 

The stakeholders are developing and implementing a coordinated Cyber-Infrastructure Plan to provide a platform for collaboration and flexibility, ensuring a productive environment for all participants. A rigorous evaluation effort is being conducted with both formative and summative components. The evaluation is designed to allow constant improvement and to determine and document the project?s overall effectiveness at achieving its intended outcomes, including outcomes related to career choices. 

Broader Impacts 
The model to be tested here has the potential to be broadly adaptable and/or adoptable. The project is targeting rural, low-income high school and community college students with high proportions of Native Americans. Specific environmental data and information will be targeted that is relevant to the local Ojibwa culture. The project schools and study area are in rural areas that are consistently underserved by cyberinfrastructure. The rural nature of the area will present technological challenges (e.g. poor cell phone coverage), but it is particularly important to engage citizens in underserved areas to demonstrate that advanced cyberinfrastructure systems can improve their quality of life and economic opportunities.",NSF,4900,MICHIGAN TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY,1400 Townsend Drive,Houghton,US,Houghton,MI01,Michigan Technological University,MI,499311295,47.070,"['Richard P Donovan', 'Robert  Pastel', 'Charles R Wallace', 'Shawn E Oppliger none']",08/01/2011,065453268,249840,08/31/2015,4900,CI-TEAM,349840,1135523,065453268,Alex S Mayer,1400 Townsend Dr.,Houghton,US,Houghton,MI01,Michigan Technological University,MI,499311295,asmayer@mtu.edu,Alex,Mayer,S,9064873372,sprasad@nsf.gov,Sushil Prasad,7032925059,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The project goal was to develop and deploy mobile device and website applications as platforms for acquiring, analyzing and disseminating environmental information.  Dozens of applications were developed by almost 200 students participating in a seriesof  interdisciplinary project-based courses. Ideas for apps were solicited from scientist collaborators in the summers preceding each academic year. Applications will be developed for transferring the acquired data synchronously or asynchronously to an interactive website through which citizen scientists will interact with professional scientists. Undergraduate students are primarily responsible for developing the apps, exposing them to real-world problem-solving with an interdisciplinary team. We have learned that efficient communication and record-keeping are critical to the success of working with the scientists. We have scaled up the geographic reach of the project to include collaborating scientists from anywhere in the world. 
Our model of app prototype development in the spring computer science and scientific communication courses, followed by final development by summer and fall research assistants has brought us closer to completing apps, is working well.     We realized that we need to encourage collaboration between the computer science and scientific communication students in the spring courses. We have studied best practices for encouraging collaboration between these diverse groups of students and see that this is a valuable ""spinoff"" area of research for this project.

Novel decentralized algorithms coordinate a group of robots and sensors for three related problems: sensor placement, event detection and tracking, and adaptive sampling, along with a unified framework for analyzing the stability and convergence of these algorithms.

Persistent underwater monitoring is deployable in any coastal environment and provides automation for collecting data in support of many environmental hypotheses. The same capabilities can also be used in the context of coastal and harbor protection operation, locating underwater mines and identifying intrusion. The underwater technology enables an unprecedented level of automation for environmental monitoring in water.

It is widely believed that the underwater world holds ideas and resources that will fuel much of the next generation of science and business. However, any underwater operations are fraught with difficulty due to the absence of an easy way to collect and monitor data. This project developed versatile and easily deployable underwater robots and sensor networks that can: (1) collect effectively the right data; (2) store efficiently the data; and (3) provide quasi-real-time access to it. The underwater sensor network includes the unique ability to adjust its depth in the water and communicate over acoustic and optical modems underwater and radio when at the surface. The robots developed in this work include a modular and reconfigurable underwater robot, a robotic fish, a drifting underwater sensor that can adjust its depth, and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that can fly over water to collect water samples and sensor data. 

This work developed fundamental theories and algorithms that enable these diverse robot and sensor systems to work together to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of water monitoring. Specifically, decentralized control algorithms allow the sensors and robots to optimize their positions for sensing while minimizing the communication and energy usage, which is critical for sustainable, long-term deployments. By utilizing the variety of communication options (acoustic, radio, and optical) available to the underwater sensors and robots, the system can optimize communication to obtain more information more quickly than was previously possible. 

This project enables the creation of underwater networks that can communicate acoustically, optically, and with radio. These systems that can be used for several marine ap- plications, including underwater search and rescue, monitoring underwater structures such as oil rigs and ship hulls, security surveillance in harbors and coastal aerial, and observing and monitoring underwater ecosystems. The research will also enable the creation of underwater observatories and will provide real-time access to color-accurate underwater images to individuals as well as commercial organizations. The underwater robots and sensors for automating marine observations in coastal waters will impact our economy profoundly by enabling new capabilities for monitoring local and global changes in the environment as well as for cyber- infrastructure and security capabilities in water.

The underwater sensor network includes the unique ability to adjust its depth in the water and communicate over acoustic and optical modems underwater and radio when at the surface.

The robots developed in this work include a modular and reconfigurable underwater robot, a robotic fish, a drifting underwater sensor that can adjust its depth, and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that can fly over water to collect water samples and sensor data.

This work developed fundamental theories and algorithms that enable these diverse robot and sensor systems to work together to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of water monitoring. Specifically, decentralized control algorithms allow the sensors and robots to optimize their positions for sensing while minimizing the communication and energy usage, which is critical for sustainable, long-term deployments. By utilizing the variety of communication options (acoustic, radio, and optical) available to the underwater sensors and robots, the system can optimize communication to obtain more information more quickly than was previously possible.

This project enables the creation of underwater networks that can communicate acoustically, optically, and with radio. These systems that can be used for several marine applications, including underwater search and rescue, monitoring underwater structures such as oil rigs and ship hulls, security surveillance in harbors and coastal aerial, and observing and monitoring underwater ecosystems. The research will also enable the creation of underwater observatories and will provide real-time access to color-accurate underwater images to individuals as well as commercial organizations. The underwater robots and sensors for automating marine observations in coastal waters will impact our economy profoundly by enabling new capabilities for monitoring local and global changes in the environment as well as for cyber- infrastructure and security capabilities in water.

Award Abstract
Day by day, threats to the cyber infrastructure are becoming more complex and, in response, so too are defense mechanisms.  One approach to securing nodes is to place a defense mechanism (e.g., intrusion detection system) on the node. This brings many challenges, with the most significant being that potential vulnerabilities in the defense mechanism can provide an additional avenue through which the host can be compromised. To address these challenges, this research investigates completely decoupling the defense mechanisms from the host, while continuing to provide insight about malicious activity as if the defense mechanisms resided on the host. This requires the development of new algorithms and the application of various techniques (e.g., statistical, machine learning, signal processing) to extract from a node?s network traffic characteristics that enable the inference of the state of its hardware components. Over the course of this project, a combination of experimentation and simulation will lead to the development of empirical and analytic models. The models will be used to develop network-based defense systems that provide capabilities similar to those provided by mechanisms traditionally considered host-based. This work leverages the concept of information leakage to bridge the computer architecture, computer networking, and network security fields. This project also seeks to broaden participation of groups traditionally underrepresented in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Accordingly, through a summer academy, the PI is actively engaging underrepresented middle school students by using current technology to convey abstract computer architecture and computer networking concepts.",NSF,4900,GEORGIA TECH RESEARCH CORPORATION,Office of Sponsored Programs,Atlanta,US,Atlanta,GA05,Georgia Tech Research Corporation,GA,303320420,47.070,,07/19/2011,097394084,310526,05/31/2015,4900,Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace,322526,1140230,097394084,Raheem A Beyah,,Atlanta,US,Atlanta,GA05,Georgia Institute of Technology,GA,303320250,rbeyah@ece.gatech.edu,Raheem,Beyah,A,4048942531,jepstein@nsf.gov,Jeremy Epstein,7032928950,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Traditionally, the network and computing device (e.g., computer, smartphone) have been considered as two separate entities. However, it was hypothesized that if the two were treated as a unit, new techniques for network security could be developed. Thus, the goal of this research program was to establish an inherent bridge between the domains of computer architecture and computer networking. Rather than considering the traditional approach of installing software on a node to observe host characteristics, the PI explored approaches for securing and managing the host by using a remote device that observes network traffic. The long-term goal of this research program is to have general principles that allow traditional node security and manageability techniques (e.g., host-based anomaly intrusion detection, host-based signature intrusion detection, node resource management, application identification, device architecture identification) to be performed externally from the network. This work resulted several publications that detailed the link between the components in use on a computing device and the network and several applications of the newly discovered phenomenon. One application was to develop a device fingerprinting technique that creates fingerprints of devices communicating on the network (without the need for software installation on the node) by monitoring the traffic generated by the node. This technique could be used to help secure networks comprised of resource-constrained nodes like those that will comprise the Internet of Things. Another application is a technique to passively detect the utilization of nodes on a grid network. This technique improved the current state-of-the-art by removing the need to query nodes to determine their workload. This reduced the traffic on the network and can lead to a more efficient cluster grid.

470,"In this age of identity theft, Facebook, and TSA screening, protecting confidential information from improper disclosure has emerged as a fundamental issue for trustworthy computing, involving both technical and social dimensions. While it is sometimes possible to stop undesirable information flows completely, it is perhaps more typical that some undesirable flows are unavoidable. For instance an ATM machine that rejects an incorrect PIN thereby reveals that the secret PIN is not the one that was entered. Similarly, revealing the tally of votes in an election reveals some information about the secret ballots that were cast. More subtly, the amount of time taken by a cryptographic operation may be observable by an adversary, and may inadvertently reveal information about the secret key. As a result, there is growing interest in quantitative theories of information flow, which allow us to talk about ""how much"" information is leaked and (perhaps) allow us to tolerate ""small"" leaks. But while it is tempting to base such theories on classic information-theoretic concepts like Shannon entropy and mutual information, these turn out not to provide very satisfactory confidentiality guarantees. As a result, several researchers have developed an alternative theory, based instead on Renyi's min-entropy, which gives strong, direct operational security guarantees.

This project aims to deepen our understanding of the theory and applications of min-entropy leakage by pursuing several themes concurrently. In the theory of min-entropy leakage, uncertainty is measured in terms of a random variable's vulnerability to being guessed in one try by an adversary; note that this is the complement of the Bayes Risk. The mathematical properties of this theory will be explored for both deterministic and probabilistic systems, with the goal of better understanding the relationship to other theories, such as mutual information leakage and differential privacy. A variant called smooth min-entropy leakage will be developed, giving a measure that is less sensitive to extremely unlikely events. To support the compositional analysis of complex systems, leakage bounds will be established for channels in cascade, where the output of one channel becomes the input to another; moreover, algorithms will be developed for approximately factoring a channel into a cascade, giving a technique for automatic sanitization. Techniques will be developed for computing the min-entropy leakage of systems, giving a way to verify whether they conform to a given quantitative flow policy; both model-checking and statistical-sampling based techniques will be considered. Finally, applications of min-entropy leakage will be explored, for example to accountability systems that use logging and auditing to identify misbehaving entities. These efforts will develop new theory, enforcement techniques, and applications of min-entropy leakage, contributing broadly to a rigorous science of quantitative information flow.",NSF,4900,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,11200 SW 8TH ST,Miami,US,Miami,FL26,Florida International University,FL,331990001,47.070,,07/18/2011,071298814,486236,07/31/2015,4900,TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING,502236,1116318,159621697,Geoffrey S Smith,11200 SW 8TH ST,Miami,US,Miami,FL26,Florida International University,FL,331990001,smithg@cis.fiu.edu,Geoffrey,Smith,S,3053486037,sgreensp@nsf.gov,Sol J. Greenspan,7032928910,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"A fundamental and vexing problem in cybersecurity is to prevent systems from improperly leaking the sensitive information that they process. But the problem defies simple solutions, because it is frequently necessary in practice to tolerate some leakage. Consider, for example, an election system. Individual ballots are normally considered to be confidential, but the election system needs to output the tally of votes, and this reveals some information about the individual ballots&mdash;in the case of a unanimous election, for example, this reveals how everyone voted.

The goal of this project has been to develop the theory of quantitative information flow, making it possible to quantify the amount of leakage caused by a system, so that some leaks can be judged to be ""small"" and therefore tolerable. Consider a system taking a secret input X and producing a public output Y. The secrecy of X is modeled using a probability distribution that specifies the probability, from the adversaryÆs perspective, of each of XÆs possible values. Then the prior vulnerability of X can be defined simply as the maximum probability in the distribution&mdash;note that this is an optimal adversaryÆs probability of correctly guessing the value of X in one try. Now consider how an adversary benefits by seeing the output Y. It turns out that this allows the adversary to update the distribution on X, giving a posterior vulnerability which may be larger than the prior vulnerability. It is then natural to define the leakage caused by the system by comparing the posterior and prior vulnerabilities; this gives a measure known as min-entropy leakage.

Min-entropy leakage has the virtue of providing definite guarantees about an adversaryÆs probability of guessing the secret correctly in one try, but of course this may not necessarily reflect the actual operational scenario. Perhaps the adversary is allowed to make multiple guesses, or is penalized for incorrect guesses, or values some parts of the secret more than others. Each such scenario can be modeled using what is called a gain function g, and this gives rise to the family of g-leakage measures.

But if there are many possible leakage measures, how can we know which one to use in analyzing a particular system? Can leakage be analyzed robustly, in a way that does not depend on questionable assumptions about the adversary? The theory developed in this project gives two ways of addressing this concern. First, one can robustly compare two systems, asking whether the first never leaks more than the second, no matter the scenario. It turns out that this robust ordering has an exact structural characterization: the leakage ordering holds precisely if the first system is equivalent to the second followed by some post-processing. A second approach to robustness considers capacity, which is the maximum possible leakage over all possible scenarios. The theory of capacity turns out to be interesting and fruitful, since it is feasible to demonstrate that certain systems have small leakage in all scenarios.

To conclude, this project has led to the development of foundational techniques for analyzing the amount of leakage caused by computer systems, supporting the long-term goal of a cyber infrastructure in which sensitive information is kept secure from improper disclosure. Finally, the significance of this work is indicated by the recent selection of one of the projectÆs paper as the winner of the NSAÆs 3rd Annual Best Scientific Cybersecurity Paper Competition:

471,"Morehouse College proposes a research and development project to recruit high school African American males to begin preparation for secondary school science, technology, engineering and mathematics(STEM) teaching as a career. The major goal of the program is to recruit and prepare students for careers in secondary mathematics and science teaching thus increasing the number of African Americans students in STEM. The research will explore possible reasons why the program is or is not successful for recruiting and retaining students in STEM Teacher Education programs including: (a) How do students who remain in STEM education differ from those who leave and how do these individual factors (e.g. student preparation, self efficacies, course work outcomes, attitudes toward STEM/STEM education, connectivity to STEM/STEM education communities, learning styles, etc) enhance or inhibit interest in STEM teaching among African American males? (b) What organizational and programmatic factors (e.g. high school summer program, Saturday Academy, pre-freshman program, summer research experience, courses, enhanced mentoring, cyber-infrastructure, college admissions guidance, leadership training, instructional laboratory, program management,  faculty/staff engagement and availability, Atlanta Public Schools and Morehouse College articulation and partnership) affect (enhance or inhibit) interest in STEM teaching among African American males?

Two cohorts of 40 students will spend six weeks in an intensive summer program with a follow-up Saturday Academy during their senior year before formally beginning their academic careers at Morehouse College. The program will integrate STEM education with teacher preparation and mentoring in order to develop secondary teachers who have mastery in both a STEM discipline as well as educational theory. 

This pre-service program for future teachers will recruit 80 promising eleventh grade African American male students from the Atlanta Public School District to participate in a four-year program that will track them into the Teacher Preparation program at Morehouse College.

Dreams to Teach program recruited AA male students the summer after their eleventh grade, prepared them for college success, provided curriculum-specific activities for college readiness, provided rigorous academic advisement and mentoring during their college matriculation, and provided preparation for secondary science and math teaching careers.  This Pre-Service STEM initiative prepared AA males for STEM teaching careers through a collaborative effort between Morehouse College STEM and Teacher Preparation faculty and the Atlanta Public Schools secondary school STEM faculty. Dreams to Teach supported students through their college matriculation.  There were six major program components: High School Summer Program; Saturday Academy I, II, and III; Pre-Freshman Summer Program; and Summer Research Experience. In addition, participants had a number of opportunities to gain teaching and mentoring experience with middle school and high school students. Dreams to Teach students were provided assistance during classroom and study time, observed the teaching of classes, provided extended exposure and support by participating in field experiences and field trips. During the school year, Dreams to Teach students spent four (4) hours per week working with middle and high school students in an after-school program entitled Raising Expectations providing tutoring and assistance with homework; served as student teachers for the Nuclear Material and Space Science (NuMaSS) program for middle and high school students; and the TRIO Upper bound program for high school students. In addition, Dreams to Teach students served as student teachers for the National Science Foundation funded Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) entitled Innovative Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics Strategy Project (iSTEM) program for middle school students during the academic year and summer.

 

A number of important lessons were learned during the program.

The number of applicants over the two cohorts (n=129) greatly exceeded the number of students that could be served by this grant with the second cohort (n=86) having twice as many applicants as the first cohort (n=43). This suggests large pools of un-served minority men are interested in becoming STEM majors, and would consider teaching careers given a similar educational opportunity. 
The curriculum team for Dreams to Teach Included Teaching professionals from both College and K-12.  The team met early on weekly to design the curriculum to close the gaps and challenges identified in order for student to matriculate and persist to graduation from College.  Once the curriculum was established the team continued to meet at least monthly to ensure program components met student needs and program objectives.  This team ensured pedagogical and content knowledge from both pre-college and college levels integration for a successful transition into college.  High school faculty understanding of students? current competencies as seniors in high school along with college faculty understanding of competencies critical for success as STEM major needed to be aligned and appropriate transitional educational support was provided through program components.
Dreams to Teach curriculum modeled strategies students will use when they become classroom teachers by emphasizing interdisciplinary approaches for learning science and mathematics and integrated inquiry-based learning, technology, and problem solving.
Ongoing weekly advisement sessions provided strategies for students to remain on track with courses/grades and progress successfully. 
Students indicated the level of importance of opportunities provided by Dreams to Teach were to them.  Eighty-five percent (85 %) of Dreams to Teach students indicated the following opportunities were either Extremely Important or Somewhat Important: Opportunity to learn about teaching and learning, Opportunity to become Peer Mentor/Leader, Opportunity to participate in Learning Community, Availability of assistance in applying to college, Opportunity to live in learning community, Availability of assistance with study skills, Availability of assistance with time management.

472,"EarthScope enables the exploration of the structure and evolution of the North American continent by scientists accessing a range of seismological, geodetic, in situ fault zone sampling, and geochronology and high resolution topography resources. EarthScope science is notable for its interdisciplinarity. Science results from EarthScope go beyond narrow analyses of individual datasets, and combine diverse observational datasets with innovative experimental and theoretical exploration. These results produce transformative knowledge for studying earth's structures and processes and in understanding hazards and guiding exploration of resources. In addition, these data and technologies offer superb opportunities to enhance formal and informal science education in the solid Earth sciences. The EarthScope National Office (ESNO) at Arizona State University serves the broad and diverse community of EarthScope stakeholders, including EarthScope researchers, formal and informal educators in Earth science, and the general public. 

The ESNO will serve the scientific community through leadership and support of the EarthScope Steering committee, via close communication with the EarthScope program at NSF and the EarthScope Facilities (USArray, PBO, SAFOD), and by frequent solicitation of feedback and new ideas. The ESNO will maintain these activities as well as further promote EarthScope by assuming a meta-leadership role in coordinating current and new earth science initiatives (such as a major focus on Cascadia, the eastward movement of the Transportable Array, developing a plan for Alaskan EarthScope investigation, impending Frontiers in Earth System Dynamics projects, and earthquakes directly affecting the US). The need to integrate EarthScope and related data and other geoscience tools remains a critical need which can be addressed using the tools of cyberinfrastructure. Interesting new and unexpected applications of the EarthScope observational systems will be encouraged (e.g., atmosphere, hydrosphere, and cryosphere).

The ESNO foregrounds education and outreach (E&O): giving it attention, expertise, and resources at the same level as EarthScope science.  This is accomplished by maintaining and expanding on effective services such as the EarthScope E&O website, Newsletters, Speaker Series, Interpretive Workshops for informal educators, and the biannual EarthScope National Meeting.  Further, ESNO adds value to the programmatic E&O portfolio through new initiatives to:

- Rapidly channel EarthScope science through new social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and the 'Geoblogosphere'; 
- Pilot and disseminate exemplary new solid-Earth science content and inquiry-driven pedagogy for K-12 STEM teacher development (in partnership with organizations such as AGI and PRI);
- Catalyze the use of regional and local results from EarthScope research in promoting place-based Earth science teaching at all levels to better engage and retain diverse students; and
- Deliver a new continuing professional education service for EarthScope researchers and educators at the university and graduate levels: the University of EarthScope.

E&O at ESNO, infused with a place-based and educator-centered ethos, coordinates the compilation and presentation of the spectacular findings and scientific legacy of the EarthScope program, and is a reliable and effective partner to stakeholders.

Intellectual merit: Exploration of the 4-D structure of the North American continent is spectacularly underway with EarthScope by a vigorous community of scientists. The results are fundamental to increasing our understanding of the Earth, for characterizing how we live with potentially hazardous Earth processes, and for guiding exploration of resources. They are transformative in Earth science and technology education.  The ESNO at ASU will be well-situated, planned, and configured to foster continued Earth exploration and discovery.  

Broader impacts: The ESNO at ASU will enhance and continue to expand a high-profile public identity for EarthScope, establish a sense of ownership among scientific, professional, and educational communities, promote science literacy and understanding of EarthScope and Earth science in general, advance formal Earth science education, and foster use of EarthScope data, discoveries, and new technology in resolving challenging problems and improving our quality of life. Scientists, educators, students, decision makers, and our fellow citizens, in the Southwest as well as across the US and abroad, will all benefit from these activities.

In this project, we have worked to coordinate and communicate a balanced view of EarthScope science through leadership of the EarthScope Steering Committee, partnerships with the EarthScope Facilities, and engagement with many geoscientists.


Broader Impacts and Accomplishments: As PI of the award, Ramon Arrowsmith was both the Chair of the Steering Committee and Director of the National Office for EarthScope. The EarthScope Steering Committee and its chair effectively facilitated communication and coordination among the National Science Foundation, the major EarthScope Facilities (IRIS, UNAVCO, SAFOD Core Repository), EarthScope and other geoscientists, the press, and informal and formal science educators.
The EarthScope National Office sought to broaden the impact of EarthScope science through education and outreach at many levels, organizing and executing numerous workshops and special sessions and via enhanced cyber-infrastructure. Arrowsmith lead the organization and execution of two EarthScope National Meetings (2013--Raleigh, NC; 2015--Stowe, VT) with 150-200 participants each. In addition, in 2012, Arrowsmith lead the EarthCube End-User Domain Workshop for EarthScope hosted at Arizona State University (60-70 participants). Arrowsmith was a proponent along with M. Miller (UNAVCO) and R. Detrick (IRIS) for the Future Seismic and Geodetic Facility Needs in the Geosciences Workshop (May 2015). Finally, Arrowsmith coordinated the EarthScope Symposium and Reception: Celebrating a Decade of Geoscience Accomplishments (May 2014). The two-day event included briefings to members of the House and Senate and a Decade Symposium and Reception that was hosted at the American Association for the Advancement of Science Building (&gt;100 participants).
The EarthScope National Office team managed numerous EarthScope community activities. We overhauled the earthscope.org web site. We provided leadership in the use of social media for scientific organizations. We continued the effective EarthScope Interpretive Workshops, the EarthScope Speakers series, and the quarterly newsletter Insights. 4 Ph.D. students and 5 undergraduates at ASU were deeply involved in the Office activities and key members of the team with important responsibilities for social media, assessment, video production, and web design and support. Much of this work was presented regularly at national meetings. In 2015, we managed a smooth transition to the next EarthScope National Office at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks.

Project Outcomes Report
Virtual Interactive Construction Education (VICE) is a developmental proposal for a project-based pedagogical model that uses cyberinfrastructure tools to improve the quality and efficiency of undergraduate STEM education. It transforms traditional subject-based lectures in construction engineering and management programs to project-based virtual interactive simulations. It scaffolds learning by introducing increasingly more complex concepts throughout the project while concurrently withdrawing support. This new pedagogical approach is a holistic model that mimics real life with curriculum topics introduced as needed in a project orientation through a simulated environment. This first module is VICE-Bridge where players learn the steps to build a single span bridge through interactive iterations. Players first assign resources to individual activities in an attempt to arrive at the minimum cost and time. The goal of this research program is to overcome the limitations of traditional subject-oriented approaches in construction education and place students in the situated context of running construction projects through computer generated simulations within a serious game. 
VICE-Bridge was tested with approximately 110 high school juniors attending an academy for students interested in engineering and 60 sophomore level construction engineering and management students. The high school sample was approximately equally distributed by gender. Domain knowledge gain was measured using a baseline pre-test and compared against measures collected within the game. The game records time to complete, number of attempts, requests for help, project cost, project time, and responses to education modules. The pre-test results were compared with the post-test results using descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation and frequency. A paired sample t-test was used to determine if there was a meaningful difference between the pre and post-test performance scores at a significance level of .05. The evaluations built into the game showed that all participants had some level of gains in domain knowledge. 
Participants completed a survey at the end of the intervention to determine levels of engagement, changes in interest in STEM and construction disciplines, and self-assessment of learning gain. Participants reported that the exercise was engaging and they reported learning gains in five of six areas. The most striking result of the survey was the self-reported increased interest in STEM and construction as a result of this exercise. Seventy-nine percent of the construction engineering and management students, who presumably already had a high interest in construction discipline since it is their chosen field of study, indicated an increase interest in construction after having been exposed to VICE-Bridge. Some also indicated an increased interest, albeit to a lesser extent, in science (37%), technology (69%), engineering (74%), and mathematics (31%). High school participants reported increased interest in construction (43%), science (43%), technology (52%), Engineering (53%), and Mathematics (40%) as a result of their exposure to VICE-Bridge. Some gender differences exist in perceived learning gains for the high school students. 
The combination of project-orientation and simulation in a game platform places students in a safe, situated context that allows for learning through trial and error. This has the potential to reduce the learning curve in the field w...",,"['Goedert, J., Cho, Y., Subramaniam, M., Guo, H., & Xiao, L.~A Framework for Virtual Interactive Construction Education~Automation in Construction~20(1)~2010~76~~~0~ ~0~ ~21/11/2015 06:57:32.546000000', 'James D.

474,"Accurate and affordable forecasting is essential for effective and widespread utilization of renewable energy sources such as wind power and solar energy.  The objective of this research is to develop a Forecast-as-a-service (FaaS) framework that (1) generates accurate forecasts that integrate prediction results from different models using data from different sources; and (2) provides on-demand delivery of different types of forecasts at different levels of details for different prices.  Forecasting activities and business workflows are modeled by applying the concept of services, composite services, and the principles of service-oriented architecture.  Implemented by using the Azure platform, the FaaS framework involves the orchestration of service activities performed by a Forecast Generator Framework, an Internal Data Retrieval Framework and an External Data Collection Framework.  Potential users of the FaaS framework include renewable energy users and providers, power system operators, and potential renewable energy users/producers that are at different stages of planning for new facilities.  The FaaS framework can contribute to the filling of two national needs ? energy independence and environmental stewardship.  It can help power companies in many states to meet their respective state mandates in renewable portfolio standards.  The FaaS framework can become a part of a national forecast cyber-infrastructure.",NSF,4900,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE & STATE UNIVERSITY,Sponsored Programs 0170,BLACKSBURG,US,Blacksburg,VA09,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,VA,240610001,47.070,['Robert P Broadwater'],04/13/2011,003137015,320000,12/31/2013,4900,Computing in the Cloud,320000,1048079,003137015,Kwa-Sur  Tam,Sponsored Programs 0170,BLACKSBURG,US,Blacksburg,VA09,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,VA,240610001,ktam@vt.edu,Kwa-Sur,Tam,,5402314448,achtchel@nsf.gov,Almadena Y. Chtchelkanova,7032928910,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The goal of this project is to develop the cloud-based Forecast-as-a-Service (FaaS) framework that enables the use of different types of data from different sources to generate different kinds of renewable energy forecasts on demand at different levels of details for different prices.  This goal has been achieved.

The FaaS framework has been developed by using the Azure cloud computing platform provided by Microsoft.  It provides on-demand forecasts of solar or wind power at locations specified by the users.  Forecasts can be long-term forecasts useful for prospecting or planning by potential investors, or short-term forecasts suitable for operational decision making by operators of existing facilities.  This project shows that the costs of prospecting forecasts are in the range of $60-70 while the costs for operational forecasts are in the range of $10-20.  Additional services such as uncertainty quantification can be requested for additional fees in the order of a few dollars.  The FaaS framework provides a more flexible and affordable alternative to the subscription model provided by current forecast service providers.  

An intellectual merit of this project is that the FaaS framework demonstrates a way to address both the technical and economic aspects of forecasting.   The FaaS framework has been developed based on the service oriented architecture (SOA).  Software entities called services and composite services have been developed and organized in different ways to implement the workflow processes for different kinds of forecasts.  In the FaaS framework, a software service has two endpoints - one for the technical aspect and the other for the economic aspect.  Based on this design, the same workflow can be developed to handle both the technical aspect and the economic aspect of forecasting.  This finding is important because it provides the basis for the future development of multidisciplinary services that have impact in several disciplines simultaneously.  Multidisciplinary SOA applications, especially in the context of cloud computing, will expand the full potential of SOA and cloud computing. 

Another intellectual merit is that the concept of the probability of persistence (POP) has been developed so that the quality of solar irradiance can be forecasted together with the quantity.  POP represents the chance that the solar irradiance received at the ground level remains within a certain range for a certain time period.  As an indicator for the extent of fluctuation, POP is useful for the design and operation of the backup systems for renewable energy sources.  Using POP and the sky clearness index, a new classification method for daily sky conditions has been developed.  Previously unknown patterns of daily sky conditions haven been observed and the understanding of how to forecast solar power based on the forecasts of sky conditions has been deepened.

Another intellectual merit is that this project advances the knowledge of how to utilize cloud computing to automate the processes that extract information from large volumes of historical data.   Developing the statistical forecasting model used in the FaaS framework and discovering concepts such as POP were data intensive processes.  Historical data useful for model development had been archived in certain formats that could be decoded only by using special software.  The process to extract information from data collected over a number of years could take weeks or months.  Using the computing resources available from the cloud, this process has been automated and results could be obtained in hours, at most days. 

The FaaS framework could bring broad impact to society by enhancing more widespread and effective utilization of renewable energy.  A major drawback of solar and wind power is their intermittent and fluctuating nature.  This drawback can be countered by making appropriate preparation based on accurate forecast to accommodate the intermittency and fluct...",,"['Byung O Kang\nKwa-Sur Tam~A New Characterization and Classification Method for Daily Sky Conditions Based On Ground-Based Solar Irradiance Measurement Data~Journal of Solar Energy~94~2013~102~~~0~ ~0~ ~21/11/2015 06:57:32.546000000', 'J.

Such insight is essential for planning and conducting research and for the rapid discovery and development of novel compounds, materials and technologies in chemical fields.    With the help of the NSF award CHE-1048629, the Department has acquired a midsize high-performance computational cluster equipped with state-of-the-art computational chemistry software, which allows the faculty and their students to better plan experiments and explain their results. The computational cluster is currently used by ten research groups spanning organic, polymer, inorganic and physical chemistry within the department. The cluster is also made available to faculty and students at eight undergraduate institutions in South Carolina in order to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in the scientific process.   The research findings facilitated by this award range from design of advanced catalysts, to new materials for energy applications, to the development of new modeling tools as reported in about 30 publications and 80 presentations.
 
Some examples of the findings made with the help of this award:

 
(1) Simulations of collisions of hydrogen and deuterium with graphene in the Garashchuk group demonstrate selectivity in adsorption which may be useful for H/D isotope separation and, more broadly, to assess nuclear quantum effects on chemical reactions unfolding within complex molecular environments (Fig. 1).
 

 (2) Adams et al. have discovered a new binuclear mechanism for the formation of carbon-hydrogen bonds in aromatic compounds. Computational analyses have revealed the nature of the bonding of a key intermediate in the transformation (Fig. 2).

 

(3) L. S. Shimizu and collaborators have demonstrated control of photoreactivity by placing the reagents into porous molueclar structures.  A greater understanding of the factors that control diffusion and  reaction in confinement leads to the development of better  catalysts (Fig.3).
 

The computational cluster is also actively used for education:   (i) students and researchers receive training in high-performance computing and use of computational chemistry tools; (ii) education of   chemistry majors now incorporates computational chemistry labs as recommended by the American Chemical Society. Moreover, the award spurred improvements in cyber-infrastructure and support of high-performance computing at the University of South Carolina.

476,"Sophya Garashchuk of the University of South Carolina is supported by a CAREER award from the Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry division to develop theoretical and computational methods that help to answer the question, when is it important to take the quantum nature of the nuclei into account when studying chemical processes?   Dr. Garashchuk and her research group develop approximate  quantum trajectory methods that are scalable to large molecular systems. This methodology is based on the dynamics of an ensemble of quantum trajectories representing a wavefunction. The development of the quantum trajectory framework in imaginary time used for the Boltzmann evolution and eigenstate calculation enable the direct calculation of thermal rate constants. The dominant quantum, inherently non-local, effects are incorporated into trajectory dynamics through a ""mean-field""-type approximation to the quantum force, which can be turned off to assess its importance in a chemical process.

Theoretical studies of reactivity in large systems contribute to the fundamental understanding of molecular systems in chemistry, physics, and biology and material science.   Dr. Garashchuk also engages in many outreach programs that broaden participation of underrepresented groups in the scientific process, attract more young people to research-oriented careers and bring more visibility and appreciation of science in a geographically underrepresented in research (EPSCoR eligible) state of South Carolina.  The computer code developed in this project is made widely available to the research community.

Goldfield,7032922173,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Chemical modeling and computations have recently become valuable educational and research tools for improving our fundamental understanding of structure, bonding and reactivity of chemical systems ranging from individual molecules to complex nanophase materials. Such insight is essential for planning and conducting research and for the rapid discovery and development of novel compounds, materials and technologies in chemical fields. The broad goal of our research is to assess and to understand the effect of quantum-mechanical behavior of nuclei on the reaction rates of reactions in molecular environments, including biological systems and materials, and to have a tool of simulating chemical processes including quantum effects of nuclei.
 
With the help of the NSF award CHE-1056188 we have developed (i) a theoretical framework and (ii) implemented for HPC  a dynamics methodology capable of including the   nuclear QM effects in realistic chemical systems.  We have merged our mixed Quantum/Classical Trajectory (MQCT) code with the Density Function Tight Binding (DFTB) codes to perform quantum molecular dynamics of large systems on-the-fly. (iii) The methodology has been applied to study the nuclear quantum effects in large molecular systems containing 50-200 atoms. (iv) We have confirmed that the hydrogen transfer in an enzymatic reaction SLO-1 the quantum nature of the proton plays a major role in explaining the experimentally observed the effect of substitution of H with D on the reactivity; moreover, we have found that the motion of the donor atom moderately increases the reactivity though the isotope effect, which is the ratio of the reaction rates is not affected. (v) We have examined adsorption of H/D on graphene (Fig. 1) and found, that the motion of the graphene is essential for the adsorption process via the energy transfer; the strongest adsorption occurs at 0.4 eV of the collision energy; selectivity of adsorption to the isotope, in principle, can be used for H/D separation which has wide ranging technological applications. (vi) We have examined the effect of H/D substitution on the  photovoltaic properties of P3HT/PCBM films (Fig. 2), an unexpected effect observed in experiments.  UV light energizes the electrons of the polymer P3HT, the electron donor, the electrons transfer to the fullerene PCBM, the electron acceptor. On the acceptor the electrons go to lower energy states, releasing energy which can be collected to produce electricity.    We have found that the quantum nature of H/D has a subtle effect on the spacing between then energy levels, which changes the electron transfer properties.  Thus seemingly small variations in the properties of the materials affects their performance when used in devices for harvesting the solar energy.  These are some of the examples of molecular systems, where quantum treatment of the nuclei is needed to understand, control and exploit systems? properties potentially leading to scientific advances and technological innovations. Our findings have been presented to the public and scientific community in about 60 presentations, and are described in over 20 scientific papers. The computational codes are freely available electronically.
 
Besides research, (vii) the computational chemistry courses were developed and taught to undergraduate (upper level) and graduate students. The students were taught not just the theory behind the quantum chemistry methods, which is the traditional approach, but also how to perform modeling and simulations using high-performance computing resources (a linux cluster) and how to apply these skills in their research (which many of then now do!).  The emphasis was on students from experimental groups. Finally, (viii) we have been engaged into extensive outreach efforts: we have  involved additional undergraduate institutions into ""South Carolina Computational Chemistry Consortium"" SC4, facilitated user training, developed the computational chemistry labs for the general chemistry-honors section and organized/gave talks pertaining to use of computations in chemistry.  The latter activities broadened participation of underrepresented groups in the scientific process. Moreover, they spurred improvements in cyber-infrastructure and support of high-performance computing at the University of South Carolina.

Title: Theory and Solution Methods for Chemical Production Scheduling

To remain competitive in todays global environment, US chemical companies have moved towards product customization and diversification, which in turn have resulted in a large number of low-volume, high-value products. Furthermore, in an effort to achieve higher utilization of resources, chemical manufacturers have started to employ multiproduct/multipurpose facilities. In addition to higher resource utilization, the flexibility of these facilities allows for lower inventory costs and better responsiveness to demand fluctuations. However, these advantages can be achieved only if effective optimization-based production scheduling methodologies, which could uncork the hidden potential of multiproduct manufacturing, are developed. The two major bottlenecks in the development and adoption of such methods appear to be: a) the lack of an unambiguous problem statement, which prohibits the development of a unified information technology framework; and b) the computational performance of existing optimization-based methods. The goal of this research is the development of new theory and solution methods that will address the second challenge.

Intellectual Merit 

The intellectual merit is in the analysis of existing frameworks, the development of the underlying optimization theory, and the formulation of advanced solution strategies for chemical production scheduling. This project will focus on the following five areas:
a) Method classification formulate a systematic classification of general scheduling approaches and modeling techniques.
b) Computational study  perform an extensive computational study of various approaches using more than 5,000 problem instances. 
c) Theory development  develop mathematical properties regarding the tightness of scheduling mixed-integer programming formulations.
d) Novel Modeling Methods  use the inherent structure of scheduling models and our theoretical results to explore ways of strengthening these formulations.
e) Solution algorithms  based on the computational and theoretical results, study new decomposition schemes and explore new search methods and design algorithms that harness the new capabilities offered by parallel computing and cyberinfrastructure.

Broader Impact

This research will advance the state of the art in the use of optimization methodologies in process operations, thereby opening new avenues of research in process systems engineering (PSE). Through the involvement of the graduate student working on this project, the results of will be used to develop educational material for a graduate level course the PI teaches. Furthermore, this material will be evaluated for effectiveness and disseminated through the Engineering Pathway and the National Science Digital Library. Both the codes and the library of problems developed during this project will be made publicly available so that others in the field can replicate (or improve upon) the results. This project will also offer the PI an opportunity to further develop his undergraduate research program. Specifically, undergraduate students will use some of the cyber-infrastructure tools developed in this effort to carry out computational studies.

Potentially Transformative Research

This research is a major departure from previous work in this area in that it will be based upon a theoretical study of the structure of mixed-integer programming formulations and the derivation of mathematical properties on their polyhedral properties. This is a subject that has received practically no attention to this point in the PSE literature. Therefore, if successful, the research will lay the foundations of a new, theoretically rigorous approach to production scheduling, which could lead to significant advances in solving broad families of operational problems.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SYSTEM,21 North Park Street,MADISON,US,Madison,WI02,University of Wisconsin-Madison,WI,537151218,47.041,,01/05/2011,161202122,314373,03/31/2014,4900,PROCESS & REACTION ENGINEERING,314373,1066206,041188822,Christos  Maravelias,21 North Park Street,MADISON,US,Madison,WI02,University of Wisconsin-Madison,WI,537151218,christos@engr.wisc.edu,Christos,Maravelias,,6082659026,mburka@nsf.gov,Maria Burka,7032927030,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"While it remains one of the largest manufacturing sectors of the US economy, the chemical industry faces a number of major challenges such as migration of customer industries, saturation of US markets, and increased global competition. To remain competitive in this environment, chemical companies have moved towards product customization and diversification, which have consequently resulted in a large number of low-volume, high-value final products. To achieve higher utilization of resources, in this capital intensive industrial sector, chemical companies have started to employ facilities where multiple products compete for limited resources (equipment units and utilities) and which can be operated in multiple modes. The flexibility of these so called multiproduct facilities allows for higher resource utilization, lower inventory costs, and better responsiveness to demand fluctuations. Nevertheless, these advantages can materialize only if the production is planned well, a task which is challenging due to the multiplicity of production modes.

To address this challenge, researchers in the area of process systems engineering (PSE) have developed a number of scheduling methods, typically mixed-integer programming (MIP) models. However, despite all the effort that has gone into developing new MIP models, the scheduling of real-world chemical processes remains an open challenge. Accordingly, the goal of this research was the development of new theory and solution methods that will advance our ability to solve production planning and scheduling problems of practical interest. The proposed research was a major departure from previous work in this area in that it was based on a theoretical study of the MIP scheduling models and the subsequent formulation of new improved and more general models, as well as the development of advanced solution methods.
The project started with a theoretical study of the structure of discrete-time MIP scheduling models followed by the development of a model that can be used to address problems in all types of production environments under a wide range of processing constraints. Next, we developed four solution methods: (1) a branch-and-bound (B&amp;B) algorithm designed to harness parallel computational resources; (2) models that rely on multiple and nonuniform discrete time grids; (3) a constraint propagation algorithm for the generation of tightening constraints; and (4) reformulation and branching methods.  
The methods we developed in this project led to dramatic improvements in our ability to solve MIP chemical production scheduling problems, arguably changing the landscape in the area. They resulted in speedups of two to four orders of magnitude, allowing us to solve to optimality large-scale instances that were intractable previously. Importantly, all proposed methods are applicable to a wide range of MIP models because they rely on binary variables which are employed in all time-indexed models. Furthermore, because the models we developed account for various processing characteristics and constraints and can be used to address problems in all production environments, our methods are applicable to a wide range of problems.
To give an example, the tightening methods are most effective for cost minimization problems, where they reduce the solution time by about two orders of magnitude. For makespan minimization, the tightening methods improve the solution time by about a factor of three. The reformulation is effective for cost minimization, profit maximization, and makespan minimization, reducing the solution time by an average of three, two, and one orders of magnitude respectively. Several large problems that could not be solved to optimality in a day can now be solved in within a few minutes using the reformulation. When used individually, the reformulation has a bigger impact on the solution time, but there is often some benefit to using both methods together.

availability and integrity of NSF-funded large-scale computational
research cyberinfrastructure. This project targets the improvement
of a particular security component that is widely used to protect
these NSF investments: the open-source ""Bro"" intrusion detection
framework, which is deployed by major universities, large research
labs, supercomputing centers, and open-science communities. Bro's
popularity is a two-edged sword, however, as it comes with demands
that are often difficult to meet for the small research team behind
the system. Therefore, this work establishes a sustainable
development model for Bro by providing explicit engineering
resources outside of the scope of research efforts, and uses them to
advance the system to a state at which Bro's user community can take
a more active role in its future development. 

More specifically, this project (1) improves the perspective of
Bro's end-users by providing extensive up-to-date documentation and
support, and refining many of the rough edges that the system has
accumulated over time; (2) unifies and modernizes Bro's current code
base that has evolved over 14 years of active development; (3)
improves Bro's processing performance to the degree required for
operation in current and future large-scale scientific environments;
and (4) adds new data analysis functionality in the form of a highly

These numbers are neither counting downloads from GitHub, nor what's now arguably the most common way for new users to get started with Bro: Security Onion, a Linux-based live DVD environment tailored to security monitoring, which includes Bro as a key component. Over the course of this project, attendance at our annual Bro user meetings grew from originally 30-50 people to 150 attendees from 60 different institutions at the 2014 event. Our Twitter account shows almost 3000 followers, and the main Bro mailing list now reaches close to 1000 people. InfoWorld awarded Bro a 2014 ""Bossie Award"" in the category ""The best open source networking and security software"", and they also included Bro into their list of ""11 open source security tools catching fire on GitHub"". Indeed, Bro is at the top of GitHub's security showcases list.

Going forward, the work for this project enabled us to lay the groundwork for sustaining Bro development long-term with two complementing strategies. First, to specifically support the broader NSF community, we created the ""Bro Center of Expertise"" at ICSI and NCSA as a central point of contact for institutions in education and science. The Center offers our team's expertise to NSF-supported sites seeking advice with Bro deployment and usage; see http://nsf.bro.org for more information. Second, to support the increasing Bro demand within the corporate and government sectors, we founded a professional services company, Broala LLC, that provides ongoing commercial-grade Bro support with the individual attention that large organizations require.

481,"Solar cooling and heating for buildings are promising alternative energy approaches.  However, the lack of reliable tools to evaluate the technical, economic, and especially the environmental benefits of these technologies presents one of the critical barriers to their widespread deployment. The overarching goal of this project is to close this knowledge gap by developing an evaluation platform that accurately quantifies the life cycle cost, energy payback, and carbon footprint of solar thermal systems. Four research tasks will be conducted in the project: 1) testing and optimizing performance of an integrated solar heating and cooling system installed on the Purdue campus; 2) predicting and evaluating system performance for 11 benchmark building types in 16 distinct climate zones based on simulation; 3) developing life cycle inventory database that integrates temporal and spatial perspectives for systems simulated; 4) developing a life cycle economic and environmental sustainability assessment platform, which integrates experimental, modeling, and database development efforts.  This project promises to deliver a novel, easy-to-use, web-based decision support tool that facilitates the wide deployment of solar building technologies and the move toward green buildings.  The integrated and modularized solar cooling/heating systems developed in the project will be a new generation with plug-play system components and optimal control strategies.  The project will compare the economic and environmental performance of solar heating and cooling technologies applied to standardized benchmark buildings in 16 distinct climate zones in the U.S. focusing on life cycle cost, energy savings, and greenhouse gas emission reduction.  The project will apply a temporally and spatially explicit life cycle assessment approach to evaluate the economic and environmental sustainability of solar cooling and heating systems.  Through cyber-infrastructure, distance learning, and student internships, the project will implement a novel approach to engage students, especially women students, in sustainability engineering and green building research.  The findings resulting from the research may be widely used in the solar technology industry.

Hamilton,7032927066,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Solar absorption cooling and heating (SACH) technologies use solar energy as their energy resource to cool or heat building spaces. They offer a promising solution to the ""net zero"" buildings. Due to the nature of solar energy, the actual economic and environmental benefits from the utilization of SACH technologies always depend on meteorological conditions, building configurations, and site-specific consumption statistics as well as production, installation, and maintenance methodologies. This inter-dependency complicates the decision-making process pertaining to whether or not a solar system should be installed and how it should be designed to maximize the benefits. The lack of a reliable platform to measure the economic and environmental benefits presents one of the greatest barriers to the widespread deployment of SACH systems. The overall goal of this project was to develop an integrated platform for the evaluation and optimization of SACH systems based on the high quality data obtained through actual measurements and high-fidelity simulations.

The test bed of the SACH, located at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, was designed and constructed in the summer of 2012. As shown in Fig. 1, the SACH system primarily consists of 99m2 of external compound parabolic concentrator (XCPC) solar collectors, a 23kW double-effect LiBr/H2O absorption chiller, a water heater as a heating load simulator, and a control and data acquisition system for data collection, monitoring, and system control. The SACH performed well in both the solar collector performance tests and the overall system tests conducted during 2012-2014.  The XCPC stationary solar panels were operated at temperatures up to150?C, and the absorption chiller was able to produce 80% rated cooling load when the solar field was operated at 150?C.

At the component level, a comprehensive platform for performance evaluation and optimal design of the XCPC was developed according to an integrated optical and thermal model of the XCPC validated by experiment data.  A novel ray tracing algorithm and bin method were created to simplify and accelerate the optimization. The optimal design platform is able to identify the best design and includes the acceptance half angle, relative concentration ratio, receiver radius, relative glass outer radius, relative u-tube radius, relative glass thickness, and relative gap distance, as well as the tilted angle for the installation of the XCPC for a specific operating temperature at a given location.


The measured performance data from the test bed were also used to develop SACH energy models in TRNSYS to predict the performance of SACH systems installed in locations other than West Lafayette. The related life cycle inventory (LCI) data were collected according to the performance data obtained from the validated TRNSYS models. Based on the LCI data collected, the life cycle analysis of the developed SACH systems were able to calculate the energy payback period, the life cycle carbon footprint, and the life cycle cost of the SACH system. By integrating the validated SACH energy models in TRNSYS and the life cycle analysis of SACH, a systematic energetic, economical, and environmental (E3) assessment model for SACH systems was developed for the performance evaluation of SACH systems.

482,"Like all colleges and universities, minority-serving institutions (MSIs) are developing strategies to support science and engineering research with advanced cyberinfrastructure. Two enabling technologies are of particular interest to these institutions: visualization and energy-conscious networked cluster computing.  The NSF-supported UCSD OptIPuter/OptiPortal and GreenLight projects are now ready for broader deployment across the US. Researchers from a dozen MSI institutions have asked for hands-on experience at UCSD.  This project provides participants with technical background and best practices on the GreenLight Instrument for computing and installing, maintaining, and using OptIPortals for advanced telepresence and visualization. 

Project GreenLight officially partners with the NSF Minority-Serving Institutions CyberInfrastructure Coalition (MSI-CIEC), which has held three workshops (to date) at UC San Diego. The organizations that comprise the Alliance for Equity in Higher Education, the American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC), the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU), and the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education (NAFEO), established the MSI-CIEC to promote, encourage and facilitate the meaningful engagement of minority-serving institutions in cyberinfrastructure. The GreenLight Instrument enables application scientists to understand how to make greener choices, while still exploiting the exponential growth of computing, storage, and networking required for them to continue to compete globally on frontier scientific research. The GreenLight Instrument helps campuses and users understand how to take advantage of novel renewable and off-grid energy/cooling sources as well as employ middleware that automates optimal choice of cluster compute/storage/power strategies. The overall result is both cost and energy savings to campuses, valuable results for all institutions but essential for minority-serving institutions which often operate with far lower operating budgets than their majority-serving 4-year college counterparts.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",Office of Contract & Grant Admin,La Jolla,US,La Jolla,CA49,University of California-San Diego,CA,920930934,47.070,,06/01/2010,804355790,49933,05/31/2012,4900,STRATEGIC TECHNOLOGIES FOR CI,49933,1036931,071549000,Thomas A DeFanti,Office of Contract & Grant Admin,La Jolla,US,La Jolla,CA49,University of California-San Diego,CA,920930934,tdefanti@ucsd.edu,Thomas,DeFanti,A,8583443415,dkatz@nsf.gov,Daniel Katz,7032922254,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"CI-TEAM Minority Serving Institutions - CyberInfrastructure Empowerment Coalition (MSI-CIEC) OptIPortable Workshop at UCSD/Calit2

 Outcome: UCSD hosted an ""OptIPortable"" workshop for minority-serving institutions in an effort to spread knowledge of the construction of portable display wall usage to improve scientific and educational collaboration. In collaboration with Richard Al?, Program Director at NSF and Professor Ongard Sirisaengtaksin of UHD,  Calit2 hosted a September 2011 MSI-CIEC Workshop on OptIPortable configuration and operation.  This workshop was supported by the National Science Foundation, through the CI-TEAM Minority Serving Institutions - CyberInfrastructure Empowerment Coalition (MSI-CIEC) and the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology. It hosted 25 research staff and faculty participants from Minority serving institutions. This was the third MSI workshop of a series at UCSD which promoted the use of advanced cyber-infrastructure to support data analysis and distance collaboration, using high resolution display wall environments connected by high speed networks; another one is planned for June 2012.

 

Impact/benefits: Virtual room technologies will enable a next generation scalable distributed, high-resolution visualization resources for collaborative work in the sciences, engineering and the arts. Distributed applications include: collaboration with multiple high-resolution data types; prototyping command and control environments; digital cinema post-production review and editing; tele-immersive 3D interactions; brainstorming/storyboarding, and other pedagogical activities.


Explanation: Dramatic display walls are much more than showcases of spectacular graphics. They enhance faculty and studentsÆ capacity to analyze local and remote data and to participate in remote/distributed collaborations. The Minority-Serving Institution CyberInfrastructure Empowerment Coalition (MSI-CIEC) collaborated closely with UCSDÆs San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) and Calit2 to present the OptIPortable workshop. The workshop was designed to help Minority-Serving Institution (MSI) faculty and staff understand benefits and possible uses for OptIPortable collaboration technologies, coupled with inspiring and practical ideas for using these technologies at their own institutions. Following the workshopÆs practical implementation training, MSI-CIEC worked with participants to discuss these technologies with colleagues and explore potential collaborative grant proposals to enable campus installations.

483,"The research objective of this GOALI award between UNC Chapel Hill and Boeing is to develop novel robot algorithms to generate digital layouts and assemblies of large CAD structures, including the parts and their motion. The underlying research theme is to create novel planning and motion (PLM) simulation algorithms that can accomodate the underlying physical and geometric complexity of large CAD models frequently used in PLM applications. The research will build on recent developments in algorithmic robotics, computational geometry, dynamic simulation, and parallel computing to create efficient methods to perform computations on large CAD structures. This will include novel geometric, planning and simulation algorithms for space utilization, accessibility problems, assembly and disassembly of objects,  ergnomics analysis, and other applications. This research is expected to lay the scientific foundation for developing digital environments of large CAD structures that can create a communication ""loop back"" between design and manufacturing engineers. Furthermore, it will lead to a new set of planning and simulation algorithms that can exploit the computational capabilities of multi-core CPUs and many-core GPUs for fast computations.

If successful, this research would result in new set of algorithms for virtual prototyping, dynamic simulation, robotics, and geometric computing.  The proposed work could enable rapid digital prototyping of complex mechanical structure, lower high costs of physical markups, and minimize time loss due to poor design decisions.  Furthermore, it could dramatically reduce the rework that may otherwise be necessary during manufacturing. The PIs plan to release new software libraries over the WWW, and expose these ideas to a broader audience by organizing workshops and tutorials. The plausible animations generated by the simulation and visualization tools could have broad appeal to K-12 students and can attract students from other areas to exploit the potential of cyber-infrastructure.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL,104 AIRPORT DR STE 2200,CHAPEL HILL,US,Chapel Hill,NC04,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,NC,275991350,47.041,"['Ming C Lin', 'David  Kasik']",05/26/2010,608195277,449712,06/30/2014,4900,ENGINEERING DESIGN AND INNOVAT,449712,1000579,142363428,Dinesh  Manocha,104 AIRPORT DR STE 2200,CHAPEL HILL,US,Chapel Hill,NC04,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,NC,275991350,dm@cs.umd.edu,Dinesh,Manocha,,9192184986,@nsf.gov,,,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"This project has resulted in development of new algorithms for many problems related to CAD (computer-aided design) and virtual prototyping, with focus on large models. These include collision checking, automatic path computation, motion planning of  human-like models, GPU-based accelerations, dynamic simulation, etc. This has considerably advanced the state of the art in the field and lead to many new applications. The results from these projects have been published in 27 papers that appeared in various leading conferences and journals, including IEEE Conference on Robotics and Automation, Workshop on Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics, ACM Solid and Physical Modeling, ACM SIGGRAPH, Robotics: Science and System, etc. The performance of these algorithms have been evaluated on complex CAD datasets (e.g. 777 model) provided by Boeing. The PIs and Co-PIs from UNC and Boeing also had multiple exchanges related to these technology challenges. Moreover, some of the software packages are available as part of open source packages.

484,"U-Pb laser ablation geochronology has become the most commonly applied tool for dating zircons. Despite the widespread application of this tool to a host of geological problems, there is little consensus with regard to analytical strategies and data reduction protocols. The result is inter-laboratory bias and both under- and over-estimation of errors on calculated dates. This limits our ability to compare results from different labs and limits rigorous compilations from databases such as EarthChem. This project will remedy this situation by developing cyber infrastructure tools in support of Laser-Ablation ICP-Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The project will develop open-source, free, software in consultation with the international community to treat with statistical rigor all aspects of data reduction, from calculation of ratios to correction for interferences and drift. Our approach will follow that used in developing similar software as part of the EARTHTIME project and requires the integration of the fields of software engineering and geochemistry. The resulting software will eliminate large sources of interlaboratory bias and serve as a teaching tool showing clearly how raw ratios are converted into dates and uncertainties.

Creating the software for connecting the LA-ICP-MS community with the developing EarthChem database for geochronology and thermochronology will provide the integration of data from this important technique into the larger data structure of geochemistry and geology. These data will play an important role in far-ranging fields such as understanding the growth of continents, chronology of evolutionary changes, timing of early hominid evolution, and linkages between climate and tectonics. During all phases of the planned work, we will involve a broad cross section of the community from undergraduates to post-doctoral scientists to help develop the next generation of analysts and software engineers.

Some of these minerals contain radioactive parent elements such as Uranium that decays to the daughter element Lead (U goes to Pb, in chemical symbols).  Determining the concentration of both elements and using a radioactive decay equation can give the age at which the rock formed.  One of the most common ways for determining such ages is by using a technique called Laser Ablation, Inductively Couple Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICPMS).  The laser is used to vaporize a small portion of a U and Pb-bearing mineral, perhaps on a spot 30 microns in diameter.  The vapor is put into the mass spectrometer that allows the scientist to determine the concentrations of parent (U) and daughter (Pb) elements and thus the age of the mineral and host rock.  A study of the age of such materials is called Geochronology (earth time) in the Geosciences.

 

This technique is used by 10Æs of labs in the United States producing 100Æs of analyses per day. Part of the work on this project was to create a website (really a project management system) where data could be uploaded, archived, and discovered by any host of users. This was accomplished during this study, and can be viewed at http://geochron.org. 

 

Of particular interest is that not only can the scientist determine the age of a rock by sampling it (the cooled magma or lava), but erosion of existing rocks produces sediment that carries the age signature of the rock in the form of mineral deposited in sedimentary rocks (call detrital).  This detrital signature can be analyzed to determine where and what ages were present in the sediment source.  This has the power to reveal past drainage patterns and where ancient mountain sources were present.

 

In this project we created a home for both the age and detrital data.  There are a variety of visualization methods that users can employ.  Lastly, the system provides long term archiving for results so that data generated are available to geoscientists, commercial firms, and the general public for the foreseeable future.

485,"A fundamental problem in cell biology is to relate how molecular level events result in the emergent mechanics and functions of cellular structures.  This is especially challenging since biological processes often exhibit organization and coupling over a wide hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales.  This can be readily seen when observing cellular structures, such as the lipid-protein bilayer membrane encasing the cell or the intricate filament architecture of the cytoskeleton.  It is expected that this organization is not only designed to have mechanics which allow the cell to resist outside perturbations from the environment, but also to be readily regulated and to provide feedback on cellular processes.


The proposed research aims to contribute to this area by the formulation of new paradigms and the investigation of specific hypotheses.  For lipid-protein membranes, mechanisms will be investigated for how mechanical stresses in the bilayer alter protein conformations, protein aggregation and depletion, and protein mobility.  For the cytoskeleton, mechanisms will be investigated for how bulk mechanical properties change when augmenting the filament architecture and  interactions through passive linkers and active motor proteins.  These will be explored through a combination of large-scale computational simulation studies performed by the PI and through experimental studies carried out by collaborators.  New mathematical and computational approaches will also be developed for the bridging of organizational scales in dynamic models of cell mechanics.


The proposed research program is integrated with the mentoring and training of both undergraduate and graduate students for work at the interface of mathematics and the biological sciences.
Proposed activities also include a number of educational and community outreach initiatives.  This includes recruitment of students from under-represented groups leveraging the UC RISE and UC CAMP programs at UCSB, teaching an undergraduate freshman seminar course on mathematical biology, teaching a graduate special topics course on cell mechanics, and participation in the UCSB Math Circle for junior high school teachers and students.  In the third year of funding, an interdisciplinary workshop focused on cell mechanics will be organized to facilitate the exchange of research results and to foster collaborations between mathematicians and experimental biologists.

In this project we aimed to tackle one facet of this problem by developing new mathematical approaches and tools for understanding the emergent mechanics of lipid bilayer membranes and cytoskeletal components.  In collaboration with experimentalists and physical scientists we developed new mathematical models, computational methods, and analytic approaches for investigating the material properties of self-assembled lipid bilayer membranes, the collective drift-diffusion of membrane-proteins, and the role of proteins in regulating the mechanics of microtubules.  Results of the project included new theories for membrane-protein interactions within lipid bilayers based on single-particle tracking experiments and new approaches to infer local mechanical properties of biopolymers from experimental observations of passive thermal fluctuations providing new assays for investigating microtubule associated proteins.  The mathematical work of the project also led to the development of general approaches and tools useful in modeling, computational simulation, and data analysis.  This included the development of stochastic descriptions for fluid-structure interactions subject to thermal fluctuations, stochastic numerical methods for solving SPDEs, samplers for high dimensional random variables, and open source software packages for thermostats taking into account hydrodynamic coupling in molecular systems.  Overall, the project contributed both new mathematical approaches and tools for investigating biological systems and specific scientitic results in the field of cellular mechanics.

The ultimate outcome of the workshop was a report identifying and articulating the critical impacts of the scientific Grand Challenge problems of the coming decade on future cyberinfrastructure.

In particular, a set of recommendations on ideas for new programs to more tightly couple advanced problem-solving in science and engineering with continuing investments in cyberinfrastructure were produced. The interests of all of the Cyberscience Task Forces were represented in this set of recommendations.

The workshop resulted in a much broader impact that articulated on the original projectÆs specific goal. A detailed report identifying and substantiating the critical impacts and needs of next-generation cyberscience on cyberinfrastructure was produced. The report contained specific recommendations for developing and deploying the next generation advanced hardware, networking, storage, visualization, and software resources for the national computational science research community, thereby impacting a very broad community of faculty, students, and research staff who depend on this cyberinfrastructure.

Beyond the recommendations for enhancements to traditional cyber infrastructure, crucial interdisciplinary computational methodologies and tools needed to support scientific Grand Challenge problems of the coming decade were also identified.

Finally, another broader impact of the workshop was the conclusion that serious changes in undergraduate and graduate educational programs are needed to prepare students for the new landscape of interdisciplinary computational science research.

This award supports the CyberInfrastructure for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets REU Site (CReSIS-REU) with a focus in areas of polar science and cyberinfrastructure (CI).  Students participating in the CReSIS REU site will be assigned to research teams within the CReSIS Science and Technology Center. The project will engage 20 students annually in both center-based research training and professional development activities.  Follow-up activities begin after the 8-week internship when participants will be involved virtually in CReSIS lectures, seminars, training, and All Hands events.  The program will provide summer educational opportunities, for undergraduate students, in the area of cyberinfrastructure and polar science and will attract a diversified pool of talented students into careers in science, and engineering, including teaching and research related to polar science and cyberinfrastructure.  The intellectual merit of the CReSIS-REU site is that it will be interdisciplinary and educational in focus and make innovative cost effective use of cyberinfrastructure. The project builds upon novel partnerships across the discipline areas of radars, engineering, modeling of ice sheets, and cyber-infrastructure.  The broader impacts of this REU Site are that it will support activities in science, education, diversity and outreach and will train the next generation of scientists, engineers and educators interested in polar science and cyberinfrastructure. The vision for this project is driven by the compelling need to draw on integration of research and education to attract a diverse pool of talented students into engineering, polar science and cyberinfrastructure related careers including teaching and educational research. The project will involve 60 undergraduate students over the three-year period.

A no-cost extension was approved through March 2014.  During those years, 109 students participated.  Highlights from each year of the CReSIS-REU program, including participants, projects, research training activities, schedules, professional development activities, seminars, mentors and staff, can be found at http://nia.ecsu.edu/ureomps.html.  This was a highly effective REU site, and it reflected the NSF commitment to the principle of diversity, which was deemed central to the operation.

Intellectual Merit: REU projects focused on CReSIS-related science.   These include the design of lightweight sleds and improved access to CReSIS data.  Other REU students conducted a validation of the 2003 Antarctic Grounding Line through the use of ENVI and several follow-on projects, which resulted in the discovery of an ice shelf that had gradually shrunk from 1972 to 2003 and has failed to reform. The feature is a former ice shelf occupying an embayment along the southern side of Canisteo Peninsula 12.5 miles north of Suchland Islands and approximately 20 miles north northwest of Cranton Bay. The US-Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (ACAN) Board of Geographic Names (BGN) named the feature for Elizabeth City State University.

Broader Participation: Demographics for these 109 students are as follows: women made up 42% to 63% and minorities made up 58% to 89%.  The demographics of this group of REU students reflects the national need to engage underrepresented students in STEM disciplines and to encourage them in their pursuit of science-related careers.  Students participating in the CReSIS-REU program represented a variety of minority-serving institutions (11) and non-MSIs (20).  Many of these universities have limited research opportunities in STEM, but our REU students have gone on to conduct independent research in this field. For example, REU alumni Jerome Mitchell and Theresa Stumpf are both pursuing PhDs at CReSIS institutions, and they were also both honored with the NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship in 2012, which was awarded to fewer than 17 per cent of all applicants.

CReSIS faculty, staff and GRA mentors worked with students to define and develop their research projects, meeting with students to discuss issues, concerns and information related to research, as well as to review and provide feedback on research poster and oral presentations. 

The grant also supported follow-up activities with the students during the academic year.  Academic Year follow up activities included support for student presentations at national and international conferences, such as the Black Engineer of the Year Conference, American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, and the Association of Computer/Information Sciences and Engineering Departments at Minority Institutions (ADMI) annual conference.  

REU participants also made contributions beyond science and engineering. During the 2013 NSF ""Change the World"" Science and Engineering Career Fair at Dulles Town Center, CReSIS students presented multiple interactive demos, including Ice, Ice, Baby! lessons, our Glacier Goo program, which utilizes ""goo"" to represent glacier movement, and online tutorials presenting knowledge of the Antarctic and Arctic.  They also assisted with the CReSIS booth during the USA Science and Engineering Festival in Washington DC.  Approximately 325,000 people attended the festival, which represents the largest celebration of STEM in the nation.

The CReSIS REU program has achieved its goal of engaging underrepresented students in polar science while providing both research training and professional development opportunities.

488,"As complex computer systems become ever more pervasive in our society, especially with the increasing deployment of multi-core processors and clusters of servers in the nation's cyber infrastructure, the demand to advance techniques on program analysis and verification has ever been more intensive. Logic-based reasoning techniques have played a fundamental role in assurance of correctness, reliability and security of computer systems. These techniques divide into two categories: general-purpose theorem proving and specialized decision algorithms. Theorem provers, enjoying a high degree of inference completeness, can prove sophisticated properties but require human guidance in general. On the other hand, decision algorithms, though confined within specialized domains, can automatically discharge a large amount of constraints. It has long been a challenge to combine the merits of the two kinds of techniques to produce a new generation of analysis tools that can handle a wide range of constraints with a high degree of automation. This research is to answer this challenge by building powerful decision theories as well as practical tools for reasoning about high-level data structures that are widely used in advanced programming languages and algorithms. The results would have wide and immediate applications in system analysis, improving the precision and scope of static and runtime analysis techniques.",NSF,4900,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,1138 Pearson,AMES,US,Ames,IA04,Iowa State University,IA,500112207,47.070,"['Andrew  Miner', 'Samik  Basu']",03/08/2010,005309844,499612,02/28/2017,4900,SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION,499612,0954132,005309844,Gianfranco  Ciardo,1138 Pearson,AMES,US,Ames,IA04,Iowa State University,IA,500112207,ciardo@iastate.edu,Gianfranco,Ciardo,,5152943264,namla@nsf.gov,Nina Amla,7032928910,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The main goal of the project was to develop algorithms to verify the correctness of complex hardware/software systems.  This is an important problem, because design errors or software bugs can be catastrophic.  It is also a difficult problem, because the state space (the set of possible states that the system can reach) grows exponentially large, especially for systems described compositionally (i.e., by composing smaller subsystems in a hierarchical manner, which is how complex systems are usually designed).

A conceptually simple but practically very time-and-memory-intensive initial analysis step is state-space generation.  Once the state space is known, simple properties can be immediately verified (e.g., can the system reach a state where no further progress is possible?).  More intricated ""temporal logic"" queries about complex behaviors (e.g., is it true that the system will always eventually satisfy a high-priority request, even if there many low-priority requests in the queue?) require more specialized ""model checking"" algorithms, but still are based upon knowledge of the state space. 

One contribution from this project relates to advanced algorithms based on ""decision diagrams"" to generate, encode, and operate on very large state spaces.

(1) We have improved the efficiency of this data structure by providing several alternatives for storing decision diagram nodes, resulting in lower memory requirements (the main bottleneck in decision diagram algorithms) and reduced runtimes.  This allows users of our software library, MEDDLY, and of our tool, SMART, to tackle larger problems.

(2) We have developed new algorithms to more efficiently generate the state space and to dynamically change the order of the decision diagram variables.  The collection of these variables describes the state of the system, and it is well-known that the order in which they are considered in the decision diagram definition can greatly affect its size, but finding an optimal order is an ""NP-hard"" problem, so we proposed heuristics that tend to do well but are of course not guaranteed to be optimal.

(3) We have designed algorithms than can find minimal ""counterexamples"" to arbitrarily nested CTL properties (a particular class of temporal logic queries).  This is important because, when a model checking tool finds an error, it is not enough to simply raise an alarm; rather, an explanation of what is wrong with the system, in the form of a complex path describing how things can go wrong starting from the initial state, must be provided to the user, who can then debug and fix the system.  This counterexample is essentially a sequence of events demonstrating how the undesirable behavior may happen;  since this sequence can contain hundreds or even thousands of steps that must be examined manually by the user, it is desirable that the model checking tool provide a short, ideally minimal, counterexample, among the many possible counterexamples.

The second class of contributions relates to the analysis of parallel or concurrent software.  Most large software systems developed nowadays are multi-threaded (i.e., they contain multiple tasks running in parallel and occasionally interacting, either indirectly by simply writing and reading shared variables, or directly via the exchange of messages.  Debugging either class of parallel program is exceedingly difficult because humans are naturally biased towards sequential thinking, while most errors are due to an unforeseen (and rare) interleaving of steps taken in a particularly unfortunate order by two or more otherwise independent tasks.

(1) Traditional ""concrete""  testing is just unable to explore all the possible interactions between parallel tasks, so the likelihood it discovers a rare error is very low.  More advanced ""symbolic"" testing explores all the possible evolutions, so it is in principle able to find all errors; however, in practice, it usually fails because the number of possible combinations for the values of the variables in each task is enormous.  So-called ""concolic"" testing attempts to combine concrete and symbolic approaches, focusing on a concrete execution while symbolically exploring alternates, while employing some technique to exclude executions that appear possible but are not.  We defined a similarly light-weight testing approach that focuses on just a single class of errors, failure to terminate, due to the interleaving of multiple tasks.

(2) The automated verification of parallel systems where tasks interact via message-passing is undecidable (i.e., no algorithm can exist to answer this question), even if the tasks are represented as finite-state machines, the simplest form of automata.  We showed that even just verifying that all messages sent are eventually consumed is undecidable as well.  However, we demonstrated a subclass of systems where verification is decidable: those where each task communicates with only one component.  This results is important because several systems of practical relevance fall into this subclass.

""This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).""

This collaborative proposal from the North Dakota State University and the University of South Dakota requests funds to purchase an automatic isothermal titration microcalorimeter (auto-ITC200 from Microcal/GE Healthcare Biosciences) for Biomaterials research and education. The proposed instrument determines binding parameters (i.e., stoichiometry, association constant, enthalpy and entropy) in a single experiment, employing a very small sample size (5-10 g per experiment). The instrument determines binding constants in the range 102 - 109 M - 1 and the limit can be further enhanced by employing competitive binding techniques. It is fully automated to run 50 samples per day. 

Currently, 10 faculty researchers (25 graduate and 20 undergraduate students) at NDSU and USD are studying the interactions of peptide nanofibers, lipid- and polymer-based nanoparticles with proteins, DNA fragments, aptamers and antibodies. Complete thermodynamic characterization of the binding is a critical need for all of these research projects. However, the only ITC available is located in the Biochemistry Department at NDSU and the instrument is more than 12 years old (VP ITC from MicroCal Inc., purchased in 1997) and the injection assembly is not communicating properly with the control computer. The instrument is inadequate to satisfy the needs of the growing numbers of Biomaterials researchers of the two universities. In addition, this instrument is not set-up as a cost-center and often the access is fairly restricted. The proposed auto-ITC200 instrument will ensure that the faculty researchers and their students at NDSU and USD have access to a state-of-the-art microcalorimeter. This will also impart appropriate training to the graduate and the undergraduate students at both universities. The proposed instrument will be set-up as a cost-center and the generated user fees will be used for maintenance and upgrade. To effectively share the instrument between NDSU and USD, cyber infrastructure-based protocol will be followed for time allocation, data processing and data retrieval using the North Dakota NSF EPSCoR supported, high-speed network connection.",NSF,4900,NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY,Dept 4000 - PO Box 6050,FARGO,US,Fargo,ND00,North Dakota State University Fargo,ND,581086050,47.041,"['Daniel  Engebretson', 'Dean C Webster', 'Jagdish  Singh', 'Shek Hang B Law']",03/03/2010,803882299,351764,09/30/2013,4900,MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION,351764,0959422,803882299,Sanku  Mallik,Dept 4000 - PO Box 6050,FARGO,US,Fargo,ND00,North Dakota State University Fargo,ND,581086050,sanku.mallik@ndsu.edu,Sanku,Mallik,,7012317888,lesterow@nsf.gov,Leon Esterowitz,7032927942,040101 RRA RECOVERY ACT,"Project Outcomes:

This award allowed us to purchase two advanced instruments for education and research.  The instruments were manufactured in the US.

The first instrument (an ultra-sensitive micro-calorimeter) determines the binding between two molecules in solution. We have used this instrument to measure the binding between: genes and carrier polymers, anticancer drugs and delivery polymers, serum proteins and various drugs.  These studies have allowed us to prepre better polymers for delivering genes and anti-cancer drugs to monolayer and three-dimensional cultures of cancer cells.

 

The second instrument (an ultrasensitive differential scanning calorimeter) determines the thermal stability of polymers, lipids, proteins and other molecules in aqueous solutions.  We have used this machine to determine the stabilities of polymers, genes, lipids, lipid-based nanoparticles and proteins.  The results from these experiments have allowed us to prepare lipid nanopartciles to detect contaminants in heparin (a common blood thinner), to prepare polymers for controlled and sustained release of insulin and to understand the interactions between serum proteins and various drugs.  We have also studied the interactions between lipid nanoparticles and verious carbohydrates employing the differential scanning calorimeter.

 

We have trained more than 10 graduate and 5 undergrsduate students (including one Native American female undergraduate student) to use these two advanced instruments.  The contents of two undergraduate and two graduate courses modified to include discussions about these two equipment and their potential use in research.

490,"The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to investigate new optimization models and algorithms that enable decision-makers to manage risk when making complex decisions in the face of uncertainty. Specific research activities include: explore new decomposition-based methods for stochastic programs having constraints limiting the probability of a bad outcome; study new stochastic dominance constrained models that allow decision-makers to set a minimally acceptable risk profile in an adjustable manner; and prove the usability and impact of these models by using them to solve problems in application areas such as supply chain management, workforce staffing, finance, and medical treatment planning. The overarching educational objective of this CAREER project is to increase the population of individuals who use quantitative tools to make decisions in the face of uncertainty. Specific educational activities include: work with a campus precollege outreach organization to incorporate optimization-related topics into their programs; develop and teach a decision-making under uncertainty module for an introductory engineering course; and design and implement a graduate course on optimization under uncertainty.

This project will lead to a new set of computationally practical tools that decision-makers can use to find plans that balance risk and efficiency. For example, these tools could be used by businesses to meet customer service targets at lower cost, by government agencies to choose cost-effective disease control policies, or by physicians to design radiation treatment plans. The educational aspect of the proposal will facilitate adoption of the methods by giving graduate students the skills needed to apply them, and by exposing a wide range of undergraduate students to the use of optimization.

A particular challenge considered in this project is to make decisions and plans that limit the risk of undesirable outcomes. The recent explosion in available data, coupled with access to this data from a fast-growing cyber-infrastructure has now made it possible to apply quantitative techniques to find high quality solutions in such settings. One such quantitative approach is stochastic programming, which originated in the 1950's, and has evolved to provide computational techniques to find good solutions in the face of uncertainties, where uncertainties are modeled using probability theory.  A key advantage of stochastic programming is that it allows the use of mathematical programming techniques to find solutions when the decision complexity is high so that a model with many decision variables and constraints is required. Traditional stochastic programming approaches, have been very successful at finding solutions that are best on average.  However, in many applications a solution that is best on average is not adequate because it may still have significant risk; that is, such a solution may still allow very undesirable outcomes to happen with unacceptably high probability. This project investigated new models, and algorithms for solving them, that allow decision-makers to find good solutions that limit risk. 

The first type of model studied in this project was a chance-constrained formulation, in which a decision-maker specifies a risk tolerance that limits the probability of an undesirable outcome occurring. In this work, we introduced new algorithms for solving such a model, which enabled the solution of classes of this problem that were previously unsolvable by any known methods. This project also led to a new algorithmic framework for solving two-stage stochastic programs, which are problems in which the cost of responding to an unknown random outcome are considered when making a decision. The project also led to new stochastic programming models. In one model, a decision-maker is allowed to specify a reference solution, and then the model seeks to choose a solution that is preferred to this solution even while considering multiple objectives. Another new model allowed the simultaneously including a constraint on the likelihood of a bad outcome, along with consideration of the costs of actions that will be taken after a random outcome is revealed. This model combines the two previously distinct modeling approaches of chance-constrained  and two-stage stochastic programming into one model that includes the advantages of both of them. 

The tools developed in this project have the potential to be used in decision-support systems that help managers in a wide variety of industries and government agencies make better plans and designs in the face of uncertainty in future outcomes.  Examples include designing power transmission networks in the face of uncertain future energy mix, making day-ahead power generation plans in the face of uncertain wind outputs, making patient treatment plans in the face of uncertain diagnoses, and determining employee staffing levels in the face of uncertain customer demands.

This collaborative grant to the Arizona State University and San Diego Supercomputer Center (PI: Baru/EAR-0930731) will support a three year Facility project to further develop and scale up the OpenTopography Portal (http://www.opentopography.org) for provision of high-performance, internet-based access to large volumes of high-resolution airborne and ground-based LIDAR topographic data sets and generation of derived data products.  The proof-of-concept OpenTopography Portal (OpenTopo) was developed through NSF/Information Technology Research and EAR/Geoinformatics support to the San Diego Supercomputer Center as part of the GEON Project.  That portal currently hosts and distributes a limited number of data sets acquired through the NSF/EAR supported National Center for Airborne Laser Swath Mapping (NCALM) at the University of Florida and from USGS and NASA-funded research.  This support will enable significant upgrades and assimilation of large volumes of extant and future LIDAR data through: 1) provision of internet-based access to LIDAR topography data in multiple formats, including ?raw? point cloud data, standard LIDAR-derived DEMs, and easily accessible Google Earth products; and 2) development of additional collaborations with existing LIDAR topography data providers and hosts (e.g.,  NCALM, USGS, regional consortia, states, etc.) to link to their data archives and/or to host and distribute their data and processing software algorithms through a freely accessible web-interface.  High-resolution digital elevation models derived from LIDAR (Light Distance And Ranging) methods (both airborne and ground-based) have been revolutionary for Earth science, environmental, and engineering applications. These data are among the most powerful tools available for study of the bare Earth surface, vegetative cover, and civil structures.  Capable of generating digital elevation models (DEMs) more than an order of magnitude better resolved than those currently available from digitized USGS topo maps or from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission products, airborne LIDAR (or airborne laser swath mapping - ALSM) provides the ability to acquire meter-scale resolution, decimeter accuracy elevation data sets over large areas at relatively low expense.  Ground-based or terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) offers even finer resolution mapping for specific targets.  These data enable research on surface processes at fine scales and extents not previously possible yet essential for understanding processes (e.g., erosion, hillslope creep) at the scales at which they operate.

 High-resolution topography data acquired with LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) are revolutionizing the study of geomorphic processes acting along the EarthÆs surface. These data are emerging as a fundamental tool for research on a variety of topics ranging from earthquake hazards to ice sheet dynamics. Although high-resolution topographic data collection is burgeoning for research, planning, and regulatory activities, the volume of data generated by the technology currently impedes wider utilization. Furthermore most researchers lack the compute capabilities required to do advanced processing of these datasets.
 This award enabled the establishment of the OpenTopography facility, specifically the design and development underlying cyber infrastructure, which includes the data management, processing and distribution components, an efficient data QA and ingest process as well as educational and outreach material all available via an efficient online portal interface.
 Since initiation of funding, OpenTopography has established itself as a portal for earth science oriented high-resolution topography, related tools and training materials, topography expertise and community support. Apart from management and distribution of massive volumes of high resolution topography datasets, OpenTopography has also led a number of airborne and terrestrial lidar workshops, built a strong social media presence, established the OpenTopography Tool Registry, and provided advice and guidance on many lidar-related data acquisition and geoinformatics projects.
 OpenTopography data holdings continue to exceeded initial projections and include approximately 174,850 km2 and 769 billion lidar returns, thousands of pre-computed digital elevation models (DEMs), and Google Earth imagery, which is very popular with users. The OpenTopography community has grown to about 5771 registered users, with countless others accessing data as unregistered guests. OpenTopography receives approximately 12,280 visitors and 39,773 page views per month. More than 36,070 custom point cloud jobs have accessed over 1,162,261,046,244 (1 trillion) lidar returns. Ever since the new GDAL based raster system was released in may 2013, more than 11,455 custom raster jobs were run generating more than 708 GB of data. More than 36,000 pre-computed DEM tiles have been downloaded in the previous system, and we stream approximately 70 GB of Google Earth imagery per month.
 OpenTopography provides resources related to using lidar topography for students at the undergraduate and graduate level, documents that explain methods, describe tools, and highlight considerations for using LiDAR data in research as well as using lidar topography and OpenTopography in the classroom. This also includes the OpenLandform Catalog serves as a resource to explore geologic landforms in high resolution digital topography for teachers, students or any interested user. There have been over 106 peer-reviewed papers, 15 thesis and 20 reports/position papers calling out OT for data or methodologies. These publications span various disciplines including geomorphology, hydrology, ecology, computer science, remote sensing, GIS etc.
 Apart from several NSF funded projects that generate high resolution topography datasets, the groups with whom we have made partnerships rely on OpenTopography as their data management facility, in part because of OpenTopographyÆs demonstrated ability to efficiently and easily distribute data to a wide and diverse community of users, thus increasing the impact of the data.

High-resolution topography data acquired with LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) are revolutionizing the study of geomorphic processes acting along the EarthÆs surface. These data are emerging as a fundamental tool for research on a variety of topics ranging from earthquake hazards to ice sheet dynamics. Although high-resolution topographic data collection is burgeoning for research, planning, and regulatory activities, the volume of data generated by the technology currently impedes wider utilization. Furthermore most researchers lack the compute capabilities required to do advanced processing of these datasets.
This award enabled the establishment of the OpenTopography facility, specifically the design and development underlying cyber infrastructure, which includes the data management, processing and distribution components, an efficient data QA and ingest process as well as educational and outreach material all available via an efficient online portal interface.
Since initiation of funding, OpenTopography has established itself as a portal for earth science oriented high-resolution topography, related tools and training materials, topography expertise and community support. Apart from management and distribution of massive volumes of high resolution topography datasets, OpenTopography has also led a number of airborne and terrestrial lidar workshops, built a strong social media presence, established the OpenTopography Tool Registry, and provided advice and guidance on many lidar-related data acquisition and geoinformatics projects.
OpenTopography data holdings continue to exceeded initial projections and include approximately 174,850 km2 and 769 billion lidar returns, thousands of pre-computed digital elevation models (DEMs), and Google Earth imagery, which is very popular with users. The OpenTopography community has grown to about 5771 registered users, with countless others accessing data as unregistered guests. OpenTopography receives approximately 12,280 visitors and 39,773 page views per month. More than 36,070 custom point cloud jobs have accessed over 1,162,261,046,244 (1 trillion) lidar returns. Ever since the new GDAL based raster system was released in may 2013, more than 11,455 custom raster jobs were run generating more than 708 GB of data. More than 36,000 pre-computed DEM tiles have been downloaded in the previous system, and we stream approximately 70 GB of Google Earth imagery per month.
OpenTopography provides resources related to using lidar topography for students at the undergraduate and graduate level, documents that explain methods, describe tools, and highlight considerations for using LiDAR data in research as well as using lidar topography and OpenTopography in the classroom. This also includes the OpenLandform Catalog serves as a resource to explore geologic landforms in high resolution digital topography for teachers, students or any interested user. There have been over 106 peer-reviewed papers, 15 thesis and 20 reports/position papers calling out OT for data or methodologies. These publications span various disciplines including geomorphology, hydrology, ecology, computer science, remote sensing, GIS etc.
Apart from several NSF funded projects that generate high resolution topography datasets, the groups with whom we have made partnerships rely on OpenTopography as their data management facility, in part because of OpenTopographyÆs demonstrated ability to efficiently and easily distribute data to a wide and diverse community of users, thus increasing the impact of the data.

The project is working with four rural school districts to provide teacher professional development and implement research-based curriculum modules for two mathematics educational software packages in geometry (Geometer's Sketchpad) and statistics and probability (Fathom). The project uses a computing laboratory so that the software packages are hosted centrally by the university and accessible on-demand for teachers and students--reducing schools' expenses for technology staff and software licenses. The project takes advantage of a North Carolina initiative to provide 1:1 computers. Approximately 50 teachers and up to 5,000 students in rural North Carolina will be impacted by this project. Additionally, the project has identified and will continue to recruit STEM/ICT professionals from local businesses to visit and mentor participating students and teachers. The study's research and evaluation uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods in a delayed-treatment design. Qualitative data sources include teacher interviews and classroom observations. Quantitative data sources include measures of teachers' content knowledge and students' content knowledge, classroom engagement, and career interest.

It was awarded to the projectÆs faculty members from NC State UniversityÆs Department of Communication, Department of Mathematics Education, Friday Institute for Educational Innovation, and the Office of Information Technology. The project website can be found at http://scaleupstem.ncsu.edu and is free and open to the public.

 

The project aimed to motivate high school studentsÆ interest in and preparation for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) professions by improving their mathematics learning outcomes. The project utilized sustained, relevant, professional development to support teachers' use of advanced software tools in their algebra and geometry classrooms, in combination with cyber-infrastructure in the form of 1:1 Laptop classroom implementation, broadband Internet connectivity in the schools and community, and Cloud Computing. The project addressed studentsÆ and teachersÆ awareness of real world applications of math through the creation and web-based distribution of video interviews of Role Models in STEM careers. These components have been integrated to form a promising approach to addressing STEM workforce shortfalls among under-represented populations.

 

This project focused on four rural districtsÆ high schools in North Carolina. It included high schools from Chatham, Edgecombe, Iredell (Morrisville Graded School District), and Wake counties. These high school students were given opportunities to engage in problem-solving and inquiry approaches to learning mathematics using visual-simulation mathematics software.

 

Professional development (PD) of teachers was provided to two cohorts of 44 teachers from the high schools involved. The first cohort attended two week-long summer institutes and completed two online PD courses focused on teaching Geometry with The GeometerÆs Sketchpad (GSP). The second cohort attended two week-long summer institutes and completed two online PD courses focused on teaching Algebra with GSP and Fathom. For the duration of the grant, teachers worked with approximately 80,000 students. Teachers were videotaped in the classroom teaching technology-based mathematics lessons. Analysis indicated changes to teachersÆ pedagogical approaches included questions and tasks of higher cognitive demand and activities that were more inquiry-oriented. In addition, assessments of teachers' content knowledge indicated significant gains in teachers' knowledge of algebra and geometry for teaching.

 

The TPACK (Technology, Pedagogy and Content Knowledge) framework was used to guide the design of teacher PD. This framework helped inform how technology (laptops with GSP and Fathom software) used by teachers and students could best be leveraged to enhance teaching and learning outcomes for students. 

 

The Cloud Computing utilized by this project was the Virtual Computer-Lab (VCL) software originated at NC State University to meet student needs in higher education (http://vcl.ncsu.edu). Scaling Up STEM Learning with the VCL project showed that the VCL was able to meet student needs in high school math learning for student use both in and out of the school building environment. By delivering advanced mathematics learning software over the Internet (Cloud Computing), the project demonstrated that students of all income levels could use such learning tools while saving costs in public education (including technical support costs) and be easily provided with advanced software to all levels of computers available to students.

 

Teachers connected the STEM professionals (Role Models) they met in person in their summer PD to the classroom through videos showcasing their work. These Role Models provided direct motivation for STEM and ICT careers to students through 3-5 minute videos of STEM professionals and academics in their workplaces. Ultimately, we produced 18 Role Model videos, paying particular ...",,"['Stein, S, Ware, J.

494,"This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) project supports the development of an interdisciplinary graduate program at Carnegie Mellon University to train researchers in the field of usable privacy and security. The program will provide courses in security, privacy, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, economics, and psychology to complement the students' primary fields of study. There is growing recognition that privacy and security failures are often the results of cognitive and behavioral biases and human errors. Many of these failures can be attributed to poorly designed user interfaces or secure systems that have not been built around the needs and skills of their human operators; in other words, systems that have not made privacy and security usable. This IGERT will train cross-disciplinary researchers and develop methodologies, principles, and approaches that can be applied to diverse systems and applications. With social and economic activities becoming increasingly reliant on cyber infrastructure and with 60% of security breaches attributable to human failure, this IGERT addresses one of the most fundamental challenges faced by society today: designing usable secure systems. It does so by: (1) producing research advances that will provide for usable privacy and security in both current and future pervasive computing environments; (2) training a new generation of researchers to engage in interdisciplinary research on usable privacy and security and apply such research to real-world problems; (3) recruiting and training students underrepresented in traditional computer security and information assurance graduate programs.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future.

This led to a number of large interdisciplinary research projects. Two of our largest collaborative efforts were our usable and secure passwords project and our privacy decision making projects.

Usable and Secure Passwords - http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/passwords.html.

In this project, we seek to advance understanding of the factors that make creating and following appropriate password policies difficult, collect empirical data on password entropy and memorability under various password policies, and propose password policy guidelines to simultaneously maximize security and usability of passwords. We also explore the security and usability of some new types of passwords. This project has resulted in 17 peer-reviewed papers in which at least one IGERT trainee participated as a co-author, including one best paper award at a top computer security conference.

We developed and implemented software to execute an improved metric for evaluating the security of password-composition policies, compared to previous machine-learning approaches. As part of this effort, we developed a guess-calculator framework that automatically learns a model of adversary guessing from a training set of prior data mixed with samples, and applies this model to a set of test passwords. We used the guess-calculator framework to study the guessability of passwords under various policies and provide methodological and statistical guidance for conducting these studies and analyzing the results. Based on our research we developed a Password Guessability Service that provides ""guess numbers"" that describe the guessability of passwords using our metrics. We provide this service free of charge to members of the research community. See https://pgs.ece.cmu.edu

We used artificial neural networks to model text passwords? resistance to guessing attacks and explore how different architectures and training methods impact neural networks? guessing effectiveness. We demonstrated that neural networks can often guess passwords more effectively than state-of-the-art approaches, such as probabilistic context-free grammars and Markov models. We also show that our neural networks can be highly compressed&mdash;to as little as hundreds of kilobytes&mdash; without substantially worsening guessing effectiveness. Building on these results, we implemented in JavaScript the first principled client-side model of password guessing, which analyzes a password?s resistance to a guessing attack of arbitrary duration with sub-second latency.

We conducted a series of crowdsourced human-subjects studies with randomized, controlled password-composition policies. This allowed us to perform a scientific comparison of how different password-composition policies affect both password strength and usability. We found that some password-composition policies make more favorable tradeoffs between security and usability, allowing evidence-based recommendations for service providers.

Privacy Decision Making
 http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/privacy-decisions.html

Our research focuses on understanding how individuals make privacy-related decisions, finding ways to make privacy information more usable to consumers, and using soft-paternalism to provide privacy nudges. CUPS researchers developed a ""nutrition label"" for privacy and a search engine for bank privacy policies. We are also studying user attitudes about privacy on social networks, privacy for mobile apps, and as the usability and effectiveness of online tracking opt-out tools. Our Usable Privacy Policy Project is developing approaches to extracting information from natural-language privacy policies and displaying that information in useful ways for users. CUPS trainees contributed to over three dozen papers related to privacy decision making, including three papers that were recognized by the Future of Privacy Forum as ""privacy papers for policy makers"" and one paper that received the Information Systems Society and Information Systems Research 2012 Best Published Paper Award.

Although online retailers detail their privacy practices in online privacy policies, this information often remains invisible to consumers, who seldom make the effort to read and understand those policies. We conducted research to determine whether a more prominent display of privacy information will cause consumers to incorporate privacy considerations into their online purchasing decisions. We designed an experiment in which a shopping search engine interface clearly and compactly displays privacy policy information. When such information is made available, consumers tend to purchase from online retailers who better protect their privacy. In fact, our study indicates that when privacy information is made more salient and accessible, some consumers are willing to pay a premium to purchase from privacy protective websites. This result suggests that businesses may be able to leverage privacy protection as a selling point.

We also examined whether the timing and placement of online privacy indicators impact Internet users? browsing and purchasing decisions. We conducted a laboratory study where we controlled the placement of privacy information, the timing of its appearance, the privacy level of each website, and the price and items being purchased. We found that the timing of privacy information had a significant impact on how much of a premium users were willing to pay for privacy. We found that users paid more attention to privacy indicators when purchasing privacy-sensitive items than when purchasing items that raised minimal privacy concerns.

This engineering education research award to Arizona State University will employ researchers to develop cyber infrastructure to infuse sustainability concepts into electrical engineering courses.  A central challenge in incorporating sustainability in a greater range of engineering courses is the need to develop effective multidisciplinary and broad systems-based education models. In this research a gaming environment will be created as a learning tool to help students understand the complex interactions of multidisciplinary sustainability concepts. The research will also improve the process of on-line self-assessment through cognitive load theory and develop a problem-based learning database. This project has the potential to serve as a transformative educational model, offering a realistic mechanism by which sustainability can be included in a wide range of engineering classes. This research will increase student motivation, reduce barriers to collaborative multidisciplinary learning, and improve student learning outcomes. Sustainability is an increasingly significant societal issue, and it is important that engineering graduates understand and are able to apply sustainability principles in their engineering jobs.",NSF,4900,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY,ORSPA,TEMPE,US,Tempe,AZ09,Arizona State University,AZ,852816011,47.041,"['Stephen M Goodnick', 'Anatoli  Korkin', 'Stuart  Bowden']",08/03/2009,943360412,150000,08/31/2012,4900,ENGINEERING EDUCATION,150000,0935247,806345658,Christiana B Honsberg,ORSPA,TEMPE,US,Tempe,AZ09,Arizona State University,AZ,852816011,honsberg@asu.edu,Christiana,Honsberg,B,4809659518,@nsf.gov,,,040101 RRA RECOVERY ACT,,,,09/01/2009,Integrating Energy Sustainability into Engineering Curricula using Cyberinfrastructure,Grant

Historically, Langmuir circulation (LC) is characterized by pairs of parallel counter-rotating vortices oriented approximately in the downwind direction driven by the wave- and wind-driven turbulence within the upper ocean mixed layer. The highly resolved field measurements of Gargett et al. (2004) first identified full-depth LC in shallow water with dominant effects on the mixing process and sediment re-suspension on the bottom boundary layer. These unique measurements have drastically changed perceptions of what turbulent processes are important on shallow shelves. The PI's large-eddy simulation (LES) of full-depth LC shows favorable agreement with the in-water observations of the turbulent structure. 

The PI will focus on LES computations of the interaction of LC with the bottom boundary layer and its impact on the gas transfer and temperature at the air-water interface. Studies will be guided and validated by comparisons with field measurements. Preliminary LES computations have revealed that the homogenizing action of LC introduces a deviation from the classical law-of-the-wall behavior often invoked for the bottom boundary layer. Furthermore, LES has shown that full-depth LC can increase the surface gas transfer efficiency by 30%. These studies will lead to new RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes) parameterizations accounting for its effects on bottom boundary layer turbulence in coastal regions. These studies will also lead to new bulk parameterizations of gas transfer at the air-water interface and temperature across the surface thermal boundary layer.

An educational program is designed to introduce computational science and turbulence in the environment to high school and undergraduate students. Through the NSF-sponsored Research Experiences for Teachers program at USF, high school teachers will gain experience in scientific computations by participating in summer research projects. Simulations will also be incorporated into the PI's Basic Fluid Mechanics third-year undergraduate level course. A citizen science network will be established to record LC events in the Tampa Bay region and promote environmental awareness.

498,"This award is funded under the Americproan Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The research objective of this award is to provide substantive and empirical evidence of the ability to enhance engineering design creativity through the use of a computational concept generator paired with team training support. The research activities will identify the strengths and weaknesses of concept generators for engineering design and advance a repository of existing design knowledge to help produce innovative new solutions. In addition, a novel gaming-style iPhone application will be researched to help populate the design repository with diverse design solutions via user-entered, user-policed, and user-rated data that will support the concept generator. Finally, the research team will produce and validate team training protocols designed to stimulate individual creativity within a team-based design environment that will accompany the concept generator in order to synergistically cultivate innovative solutions.

If successful, this research will result in a concept generation technology and team training protocols capable of enhancing the creativity of engineering designers at all levels of experience and for both academia and industry alike. The software, including the concept generator and the iPhone application, as well as the team training modules, will be freely available for educators, industry, and the population at large. The research will incorporate test cases from several different freshman and senior undergraduate team-based design projects, including assistive devices for the elderly or disabled and engineered entertainment devices for theater special effects. The results will be disseminated through journal and conference publications and special topic workshops held in conjunction with annual conferences for both engineering design and psychology communities involved with creativity research.

Concurrency-related vulnerabilities are pervasive in modern computing
systems.  Concurrency exploits include time-of-check-to-time-of-use
(TOCTTOU) race conditions in file systems, attacks on signal handlers,
and evasive malware that uses concurrency to escape sandboxing
mechanisms.  As processors feature ever more parallelism, and
computers process more of our sensitive data, defending against
concurrency attacks is a key challenge for the coming decade.

The first goal is to protect legitimate applications from concurrency
attacks when they access system resources (e.g., prevent TOCTTOU
attacks on file accesses and exploitable race conditions in signal
handlers).  The objective is to provide application programmers with
mechanisms and policies for synchronizing access to system resources
so they can avoid unintentional vulnerabilities.

The second goal is to provide strong confinement of untrusted code in
the presence of concurrency, i.e., blocking intentionally malicious
behavior.  Today's malware abuses concurrency mechanisms to bypass and
circumvent containment mechanisms like reference monitors and system
call wrappers.  Providing robust system support for containing
malicious code is a critical challenge in intrusion detection and
prevention.

Modern computing systems fundamentally depend on concurrency for their
performance and functionality.  Making sure that concurrency is used

Coastal erosion has increasingly become a concern due to rising global sea levels, changing climate and accelerating human activities. The hydrodynamics in the surf zone has significant influences on nearshore sediment transport, hence shoreline erosion, and on the transport and mixing that affect the water quality in coastal oceans and floodplains. Understanding the complex dynamics of the nearshore system is of fundamental relevance to the development of reliable predictive tools for planning, management and mitigation to build a sustainable and resilient coastal environment. This study aims to improve this understanding by investigating the multi-scale interactions among three key nearshore processes: waves, currents and sediment transport. Rip currents, an important nearshore process, are also a dangerous beach hazard, accounting for 80% of surf zone rescues in the US. Theoretical understanding of their generation mechanisms has not been satisfactory, in particular on beaches lacking alongshore variability. Recent studies have mostly focused on morphodynamic instabilities, stressing the feedback between currents and sediment transport but not fully considering the dynamical interaction between waves and currents. This research will investigate all multi-scale interactions. The research will use extensive linear instability analysis, numerical modeling of the nonlinear multi-scale dynamics, and model validation through comparisons with observations. The methodology developed here will be applicable in modeling other environmental systems including estuaries and floodplains. Research and education will be fostered by developing a graduate research program and curriculum in coastal dynamics and environmental fluid mechanics. This will rejuvenate undergraduate education in fluid mechanics at NC State to stress its role in natural environments. Key concepts of coastal engineering research will be brought into the K-12 science curriculum by direct interaction with teachers through a collaborative initiative. Further broad impacts are expected through the outreach programs of the PI's collaborators, including the National Weather Service, Army Corps of Engineers Field Research Facility, Sea Grant and UNC-Coastal Studies Institute.

The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is the development of a methodology for the analysis of wind loading and structural response uncertainty for tall buildings affected by wind hazards. This study will contribute to the quantification of such uncertainties through a combination of analytical and numerical simulation methods, which will be validated through an experimental study in wind tunnel. Attention will be focused on the loading induced by synoptic and hurricane winds. The deliverables will include the implementation of a set of numerical and analytical computer methods for the quantification of the damage. The following issues will be considered: 1) discomfort levels for occupants, 2) damage to the façade of the building, 3) damage to other non-structural elements, 4) immediate occupancy criteria for essential facilities in the aftermath of a severe wind storm. The analysis of economical impacts, for example associated with maintenance repairs and downtime losses, will be addressed.

The results of this research activity will contribute to the minimization of economic losses on tall buildings affected by wind hazards. The outcomes of the study will also provide indication for the derivation of simplified design rules for structural design. Integrated educational and outreach activities will include: direct training of graduate and undergraduate students, department-level and college-wide demonstrations for graduate and undergraduate students, creation of an expert system for awareness against wind hazards, short courses for practicing engineers, technology and data sharing through the collaboration with a wind engineering cyber-infrastructure network",NSF,4900,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,360 HUNTINGTON AVE,BOSTON,US,Boston,MA07,Northeastern University,MA,021155005,47.041,,07/08/2009,001423631,430000,07/31/2014,4900,Structural and Architectural E,430000,0844977,001423631,Luca  Caracoglia,360 HUNTINGTON AVE,BOSTON,US,Boston,MA07,Northeastern University,MA,021155005,lucac@coe.neu.edu,Luca,Caracoglia,,6173735186,@nsf.gov,,,040101 RRA RECOVERY ACT,,,"['Farid Moghim, Luca Caracoglia~A Numerical Model for Wind-Borne Compact Debris Trajectory Estimation: Part 1 - Probabilistic Analysis\nof Trajectory in the Proximity of Tall Buildings~Engineering Structures~38~2012~153~~doi:10.1016/j.engstruct.2011.11.020~0~ ~0~ ~21/11/2015 06:57:32.546000000', 'Thai-Hoa Le, Luca Caracoglia~Reduced-Order Wavelet-Galerkin Solution for the Coupled, Nonlinear Stochastic Response of Slender Buildings in Transient Winds~Journal of Sound and Vibration~344~2015~179~~10.1016/j.jsv.2015.007~0~ ~0~ ~21/11/2015 06:57:32.546000000', 'Marra A.

503,"Ready access to reliable spatial and temporal data on rainfall amounts is essential to studies of the terrestrial water cycle and, more generally for studies of biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial environments.  The Hydro-NEXRAD system has included multiple users in the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) LTER study site, with a special focus on analyses of ?hot spot ? hot moment? biogeochemical cycling associated with wetting and drying episodes.  System upgrades and expansions of the data sets will increase the user base to include scientists involved in terrestrial biogeochemical cycle research in diverse settings across the US.  People who research or teach in fields related to biogeochemical cycling come from many disciplines, and few are familiar with the cutting-edge technology now used to measure rainfall and its strengths and limitations.  This project would provide them a usable tool tested in actual research projects that are relevant to their research and educational interests.
Researchers in many disciplines who need rainfall data would acquire an innovative software product that would enhance rapid access to more precise and reliable information to support scientific discovery.  A tested and refined product would be passed on to a cyber-infrastructure team for continuing user support after the project concludes.  The transformation in obtaining reliable precipitation data would transform the water balance studies that are foundational for a wide range of research.  Especially important is the capability for rainfall analysis over a broad range of time and space scales and organized by drainage basins.
Intellectual merit.  Hydro-NEXRAD is innovative over-the-Internet technology for organizing and accessing data from the national network of weather radars thus enabling increased use of the data in hydrologic research and education.  This technology allows rapid producing of customized drainage basin-centric rainfall maps by merging data from multiple radars and rain gauges.  This proposal is to test system performance against what researchers need to support work on flood hydrology, water quality modeling, eco-hydrological analyses of water and biogeochemical cycles, water transport in river networks, evaluation and calibration of distributed hydrologic models, etc.  Important issues are accuracy limits, validation methodologies, estimation uncertainties, and how these vary with climate, topography, etc.  Additional issues arise in working in real time and exploiting the ?super-resolution? upgrade of the NEXRAD system in 2008.  Other user needs surface in using the products to support course work.  The goal is to close this gap between ?rainfall products? and ?user needs? by working with both data providers (principally NOAA and UCAR?s Unidata) and with users.
Broader impacts.  The product would serve research and teaching in hydrologic science and provide a prototype for future radar-rainfall data systems for general research use and for water resources management in the public and private sectors.  The Hydro-NEXRAD system has developed a strong user base, as documented in part through supporting letters from users, but efforts should be made to expand the user base to include a broad spectrum of applications in hydrology, agriculture, engineering design, ecology, forestry and urban planning The PIs will  promote their product through conventional publications documenting system capabilities and performance tests, but these publications should be directed at applications groups that are underrepresented in the current set of users.  The PIs will also utilize ?outreach? capabilities to potential user groups, especially through community-based organizations like CUAHSI.  The Hydro-NEXRAD system has also developed an active group of users for educational activities.  The educational impact of the system will be expanded by promoting tools that have been developed by users through the CUAHSI outreach activities.

Dependable and effective access to large amounts of sustained computing power is strategic to scientific discovery in a vast range of disciplines. An ever expanding number of science communities worldwide rely on Condor software tools to harness the power of shared computing resources. Closer to home, over 100 US universities have installed these tools on their campus, and downloads of the 
software surpass 2,000 per month. From fulfilling a strategic role of managing high-energy physics computing resources at Brookhaven and Fermi National Labs to enabling research computing at smaller under-represented institutions, Condor technology represents the culmination of 20 years of distributed computing research. The efforts outlined in this proposal allow the research contributions of this software to continue, and strengthen the momentum to enable academia and industry to leverage the power of effective distributed computing. 

The intellectual merit of the proposed effort lies within the novelty of the distributed mechanisms implemented and the software engineering challenges the team faces in developing, maintaining and supporting nearly one million lines of code in an academic setting. As a leading provider of open-source distributed computing capabilities, the software plays an important role as a primary ?building block? in many campus grids as well as community, national and international cyber-infrastructure initiatives. The size, complexity, diversity and quality assurance requirements of the software also lead to challenges in the area of software engineering and integration. Daily builds and testing, version control, software tracking and distributed troubleshooting of multi-layer software stacks are examples of the ongoing challenges.  

The broader impacts of this effort are interdisciplinary and span both academia and industry. Researchers who use Condor tools are able to greatly increase their computing throughput, and consequently increase the size and complexity of the problems they study. The software is widely used in many compute-intensive disciplines, including Art, Biotechnology, Economics, Chemistry, Medical, High Energy and Nuclear Physics, and Computer Science, and has been adopted by both universities and government labs. Furthermore, the software plays a critical role by managing the majority of the compute resources for the US Large Hadron Collider experiments, as well as serving 250 LIGO scientists studying gravitational waves. Condor technology fuels new commercial offerings, such as Red Hat's MRG and Cycle Computing's CycleServer in the past year. These technologies are also used for mission-critical tasks in industry; e.g., Micron Technology uses Condor on 15,000 CPUs worldwide to validate memory chip manufacturing, J.P. Morgan uses Condor on 5,000 CPUs for real-time financial portfolio analysis, and Disney's fully animated film ""The Wild"" used Condor to render more than 70 million frames. Because the high throughput computing capabilities we offer effectively harness even desktop machines running 
Windows, it enables students and scientists at underrepresented institutions to pursue research and instruction requiring considerable computing in the absence of access to traditional high-end computing facilities. This proposal directly funds five students, and through GLOW it will provide an excellent training

505,"Quantum computers offer the potential to exponentially speed up the solution of certain classically hard computational problems.  It is already known, for example, that quantum computers can efficiently factor numbers (something modern computers cannot do), and this fact implies that quantum computers can break the majority of cryptographic systems which protect our nation's cyber-infrastructure.  The quantum factoring algorithm is the main motivation behind current research into actually building a quantum computer.  In this grant, the investigator proposes a new approach to efficiently solving a computational problem--the graph isomorphism problem--which might also admit an exponential speedup over the best classical algorithm for the problem.  The graph isomorphism problem is to tell whether two given graphs (a collection of vertices with edges connecting them) can be made to look identical to each other by permuting the different vertices.  The approach taken here is different from that taken by the majority of the quantum algorithms community and centers on a novel class of quantum random walks, those in which the walkers carry topological quantum numbers.  This approach follows from a series of failed proposals to graph isomorphism based on random walks by hard-core bosons or fermions and is motivated by the form in which these proposals fail.  Finding an efficient quantum algorithm for the graph isomorphism problem would be potentially transformative and would provide a major new justification for building a large quantum computer.  The approach chosen by the PI also introduces a novel quantum algorithm technique--quantum random walks by anyons--which has the potential to be useful a primitive outside of the graph isomorphism problem.   Finally, the award will be used to support the training of graduate students who work on the boundary between computer science and physics, and thus strengthen connections across this interdisciplinary divide.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,4333 Brooklyn Ave NE,Seattle,US,Seattle,WA07,University of Washington,WA,981950001,47.070,['Aram W Harrow Dr.'],05/28/2009,605799469,,05/31/2013,4900,ALGORITHMIC FOUNDATIONS,507922,0916400,042803536,Paul W Beame,4333 Brooklyn Ave NE,Seattle,US,Seattle,WA07,University of Washington,WA,981950001,beame@cs.washington.edu,Paul,Beame,W,2065435114,dmaslov@nsf.gov,Dmitry Maslov,7032928910,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Normal 0     false false false  EN-US X-NONE X-NONE                                                                                                                                                                        
Research: 
 
In the first two years the PI of the grant was Dave Bacon.  Bacon worked initially with a grad student to study the spectral properties of quantum walks with anyons. Followup numerical investigations were performed by Bacon and an undergrad student.  This was applied to the search for new graph isomorphism algorithms in work by Bacon and two undergraduate students.   An important tool in working with anyons was the concept of adiabatically moving a quasiparticle.  Bacon went on to investigate applications of this tool with Steve Flammia, who was at the time a postdoc at the Perimeter Institute, along with another UW grad student.
 

In the second year, a new grad student joined the group and worked on state preparation methods for solving graph isomorphism.  He also worked on the Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm, its variants and a possible quantum analogue.  This work led to a collaboration with Aram Harrow which found quantum speedups for oracle problems that involve group theory and are inspired by graph isomorphism.  In examining the practical side of the resulting quantum algorithms, the grad student also worked on 2-d quantum architectures.  Harrow also (together with collaborators from Bristol) worked on highly connected quantum architectures.

 

The following year Dave Bacon left UW and Aram Harrow became PI of the grant.  The grad student's work on graph isomorphism led him to work on the problem of group isomorphism.  Part of this also involved the PI and grad student working with REU students on empirical evaluation of algorithms for group and graph isomorphism.  Two more grad students joined the project and began work on a different application of random walks to quantum computing.  They were seeking to understand the performance of quantum Monte Carlo algorithms (which are classical random-walk-based algorithms for simulating quantum systems) as applied to adiabatic quantum algorithms.  This work also involved two REU students, one of whom performed numerical experiments on the k-extendable approximation to the set of separable states.

 

Finally in the last half year of the grant, Harrow moved to MIT, and Paul Beame became PI while Harrow remained a co-PI.  For more than a year, the grad students were jointly supervised by Beame and/or Harrow.  Two grad students remained at UW but have moved to MIT as long-term visitors, while another grad student on the project made plans to transfer to MIT in Fall 2013.  During this time the UW grad student further improved his group isomorphism work.   Beame, together with two collaborators, worked on determining whether quantum algorithms (particularly those involving random walks) are more efficient with respect to time-space tradeoffs than classical algorithms for exactly computing certain statistical measures such a frequency moments over sliding windows on data.  The UW/MIT grad student also worked on algorithms for the group extension equivalence problem.

 

Results:

 

Our work produced the new paradigm of adiabatic one-way quantum computing, which encompasses adiabatic gate teleportation and the quantum transistor.   This has been published in Physics Review X, Physics Review A, and Physics Review Letters. 

 

Our architecture work led to general-purpose speedups and the first polylog-depth 2-d implementation of Shor's algorithm.  It has been published in the Proceedings of TQC and the Proceedings of the Royal Society.

 

Our group isomorphism work developed the first polynomial speedup of the problem in 40 years.  The work on group extension equivalence also developed several new exponential quantum speedups for natural problems (based on computational assumptions).

While digital science libraries are increasingly common, systematic assessment of their impact is nearly absent. This study is a beginning in addressing that gap. It is investigating whether access to cyber-infrastructure-based materials for teaching and learning in STEM results in more widespread and effective diffusion of resources than a traditional paper-based production and distribution. Using both a quasi-experimental design and network analysis, the project is testing a series of hypotheses that were generated from diffusion and network theory that are applicable across STEM disciplines.  Examples are whether user networks are homophilious, whether digitizing materials increases the scope density and rate of usage, and whether digitizing results in greater participation in the production of materials. This research has the potential to advance theoretical and practical insights into the means by which scientific resources for classroom use are diffused throughout networks of teachers and scholars in STEM fields. Research shows that introducing technological innovation does not ensure the diffusion of new ideas and that the diffusion of innovation occurs through social networks mediated by their density and the relative status of their members. 
The American Sociological Association (ASA) is creating the digital materials for this study.  ASA is launching a digital teaching resource center by moving more than 16,500 pages of teaching modules from a print-based delivery system into a web-based interactive digital science library. 
A key step of this project is the creation of a database of all 14,000 members of the ASA and their demographic, departmental, and institutional characteristics, their use of the paper-based science teaching materials, and the networks in which they participate (measured by the links such as graduate school cohorts, dissertation committees, and co-authors) among users, and the links among non-users. An updated database will be created in the second year in order to compare the characteristics of users and non-users, and their networks, of the paper resource materials and the digital library. In addition, the rate of adoption of individuals in denser or less dense networks will be assessed. 
As a membership organization ASA is able to establish a yearly database of both users and non-users of STEM teaching materials.  This membership database is a bounded network of association members that makes network analysis easier to conduct.  The availability of these data provides a set of unobtrusive measures that will avoid many of the costs and problems of other data collection methods. It is possible that the findings from this project will provide key insights about how to facilitate the movement of cutting-edge scientific findings into the classroom.",NSF,4900,"AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION, THE","1430 K Street, NW",Washington,US,Washington,DC00,American Sociological Assoc,DC,200052529,47.076,"['Jean H Shin', 'Margaret  Vitullo', 'Olga V Mayorova']",05/05/2009,074801341,155760,04/30/2012,4900,CCLI-Type 1 (Exploratory),155760,0837121,,Roberta  Spalter-Roth,"1430 K Street, NW",Washington,US,Washington,DC00,American Sociological Assoc,DC,200052529,spalter-roth@asanet.org,Roberta,Spalter-Roth,,2023839005,mboylan@nsf.gov,Myles G.

507,"The functions of over 1/3 of the annotated protein-coding genes of the Arabidopsis genome are still unknown, and the annotation of an even larger portion of the genome is not sufficiently accurate for unambiguous assignment of function at the biochemical and physiological levels. This project will bring together a consortium of multidisciplinary collaborators to establish pipelines for generating metabolomics data-streams and to provide statistical and computational interpretation of the resulting integrated datasets.  The goal is to develop metabolite-profiling capabilities that will enhance the research community's ability to formulate testable hypotheses concerning Arabidopsis gene functions. The consortium has developed metabolomic platforms that together detect approximately 1,800 metabolites, of which 900 are chemically defined. The aim of the project is to apply these established metabolite-profiling platforms to reveal changes in the metabolome associated with knockout mutations in up to 200 Arabidopsis genes of unknown function and compare these to similar mutants in 50 genes of known function.  The consortium will disseminate these data via the existing multi-functional metabolomics database: www.plantmetabolomics.org.  Enhancement of this database and associated statistical and visualization toolsets will enable researchers to formulate testable computational models of the metabolic network of Arabidopsis. The successful completion of these goals and integration with other NSF-sponsored functional genomics and cyber infrastructure developments will generate transformational resources for ultimately modeling the complex metabolism of Arabidopsis. 

Broader Impacts
The project will develop new resources for the research community that will enhance the capability to globally profile genome expression at the metabolite level. These metabolite resources, in collaboration with other NSF-funded resource development projects, will enable researchers in the community to formulate credible, testable hypotheses concerning gene function. The project will foster the development of the science of metabolomics as a functional genomics tool through workshops, internships and organization of national and international meetings.  The project will also develop new activities to enhance the impact of science education and training in the community, by conducting workshops for researchers at consortium labs and at international biological meetings. In addition, research internships will be offered to undergraduate students, eight of whom will have the opportunity to experience international science training in a European genomics laboratory.  These research-based training internships will illustrate to the students the synergy that accompanies the integrated applications of chemistry, biochemistry, genetics, bioinformatics and computational sciences to solving complex biological problems.",NSF,4900,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,1138 Pearson,AMES,US,Ames,IA04,Iowa State University,IA,500112207,47.074,"['Ruth  Welti', 'Lloyd W Sumner', 'Seung  Rhee', 'Oliver  Fiehn']",03/02/2009,005309844,2925398,02/28/2014,4900,METABOLIC BIOCHEMISTRY,2925398,0820823,005309844,Basil J Nikolau,1138 Pearson,AMES,US,Ames,IA04,Iowa State University,IA,500112207,dimmas@iastate.edu,Basil,Nikolau,J,5152949423,@nsf.gov,,,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"One of the major challenges of high-throughput biological research based on genomics is the fact that the vast majority of the genes that are being cataloged by genome sequencing projects are annotated based upon sequence homology.  Because experimentally based annotation is a slower process than genome sequencing, the majority of homology-based annotations are not based on experimentally verified data.  This multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary project tested the utility of integrating metabolomics in discovering the function of genes whose function(s) are unknown. By integrating genomics, genetics with metabolomics, the underlying hypothesis of the project was that metabolomics data would be highly revealing of accurate gene functions.  The project, through its construction of an integrated multi-institutional analytic platform demonstrated this capability by compiling metabolite ID and abundance data of nearly 1800 metabolites across 250 mutant lines of Arabidopsis. In addition to the actual data, the project established standardized protocols for generating such comprehensive and accurate metabolomics data, and associated metadata, and distributing these through newly developed, online databases, www.plantmetabolomics.org and http://metnetdb.org/PMR/.  The success of the project is evidenced by the fact that metabolomics is now a major thrust in many functional genomics research projects, and some of these projects are depositing their metabolomics data within this projectÆs PMR database.  Furthermore, this project was precedence setting and led to a number of institutions to invest in facilities and faculty, which has therefore expanded this countryÆs metabolomics research capabilities.  Moreover, the broader, long-term impact of the project is through the training of undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students in a multi-disciplinary setting that is at the interface between biochemistry, analytical chemistry, genetics and genomics, and biostatistics and computational sciences.

508,"The research objective of this award is to improve understanding and capabilities in concept generation through design by analogy methods. The proposed approach, a collaboration between the disciplines of cognitive psychology, engineering design and computer science, is to provide new tools for design based on a representation that associates functional and geometric information, combining a linguistic search for functional similarity with a multi-level search for geometric similarity to automatically identify and present analogies to the designer. The initial application for the Verrocchio Project is the design of prosthetic and orthotic devices for persons with disabilities, a domain that is ripe for innovation. The initial search space is the USPTO utility patent repository.  Deliverables will include: (1) means to more effectively generalize design problems through functional descriptions; (2) the ability to search for analogical solutions with alternative functional representations; (3) ways to search for geometric similarities across a set of functional analogies; and (4) the ability to produce a tractable set of analogies for use by the designer.  

If successful, the results of this research will have five broad and transformative impacts. The first impact arises from the key product of the research: a method for systematically and automatically identifying analogies. This tool will have broad applicability across many product domains, and will improve the efficiency of the search for innovative products in those domains. Second, the research will advance the foundation for use of analogies in engineering design methods. Third, because the research will result in a computer implementation of the method, the work will add to the growing cyber infrastructure of the country. Fourth, the interdisciplinary nature of the research ensures cross-fertilization of theory and research techniques in each of the collaborators? disciplines. This interdisciplinarity will enhance the probability of broad adoption of the approach. Fifth, instructional materials will be developed for training students in the approach. These instructional materials will be freely available to instructors at other institutions, encouraging broader adoption of the approach.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH THE,University Club,Pittsburgh,US,Pittsburgh,PA14,University of Pittsburgh,PA,152132303,47.041,,02/25/2009,004514360,162037,06/30/2013,4900,ENGINEERING DESIGN AND INNOVAT,162037,0855293,004514360,Christian D Schunn,University Club,Pittsburgh,US,Pittsburgh,PA14,University of Pittsburgh,PA,152132303,schunn@pitt.edu,Christian,Schunn,D,4126248807,@nsf.gov,,,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,"['Chan, J., Fu, K., Schunn, C.

The method uses different stages of textural similarity matching and Bayesian structure creation.

The structures created with this methodology yield spaces of patents that are meaningfully arranged into labeled clusters, and labeled regions, based on their functional similarity or surface content similarity.  Examples showed that cross-domain associations, and perhaps transfer of knowledge, based on functional similarity can be extracted from the function based structures, and even from the surface content based structures as well.  The comparison of different structural form types is shown to yield different insights into the arrangement of the space, the interrelationships between the patents, and the information within the patents that is attended to &ndash; enabling multiple representations of the same space to be easily accessible for design inspiration purposes.  In addition, the placement of a design problem in the space effectively points to the most relevant cluster of patents in the space as an effective starting point of stimulation. 

The work illustrated that in general near patents can stimulate more similar concepts while more distant ones can stimulate more novel concepts.  However there is such a thing as too near or too far where too near may be too similar and too far may be irrelevant to the design conceptualization task.  Instead a ""sweet spot"" is proposed that balances the search for novel solutions with the practicality of the design task.

Cognitive studies verified the use of the tool to inspire design, and also the relevance for experts as well as novices.

With a way to extract the interrelatedness and interconnectedness of patents in the space, designers might be able to strategically choose which cross-domain designs to expose themselves to, or even traverse the space in a more intentional and meaningful exploratory way. By allowing for more efficient and insightful access to external analogical stimuli, this approach might enable designers have the potential to create more innovative design solutions.

Award Abstract
Day by day, threats to the cyber infrastructure are becoming more complex and, in response, so too are defense mechanisms.  One approach to securing nodes is to place a defense mechanism (e.g., intrusion detection system) on the node. This brings many challenges, with the most significant being that potential vulnerabilities in the defense mechanism can provide an additional avenue through which the host can be compromised. To address these challenges, this research investigates completely decoupling the defense mechanisms from the host, while continuing to provide insight about malicious activity as if the defense mechanisms resided on the host. This requires the development of new algorithms and the application of various techniques (e.g., statistical, machine learning, signal processing) to extract from a node?s network traffic characteristics that enable the inference of the state of its hardware components. Over the course of this project, a combination of experimentation and simulation will lead to the development of empirical and analytic models. The models will be used to develop network-based defense systems that provide capabilities similar to those provided by mechanisms traditionally considered host-based. This work leverages the concept of information leakage to bridge the computer architecture, computer networking, and network security fields. This project also seeks to broaden participation of groups traditionally underrepresented in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Accordingly, through a summer academy, the PI is actively engaging underrepresented middle school students by using current technology to convey abstract computer architecture and computer networking concepts.",NSF,4900,"GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FOUNDATION, INC.",G76Dahlberg Hall 30 Courtland St,Atlanta,US,Atlanta,GA05,"Georgia State University Research Foundation, Inc.",GA,303023999,47.070,,02/10/2009,837322494,400000,08/31/2011,4900,ITR-CYBERTRUST,89474,0844144,,Raheem A Beyah,30 Courtland Street,Atlanta,US,Atlanta,GA05,Georgia State University,GA,303033044,rbeyah@ece.gatech.edu,Raheem,Beyah,A,4048942531,clandweh@nsf.gov,carl landwehr,7032920000,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,['Lanier Watkins; William H.

512,"Project Abstract: CAREER: Exploiting Collective Behaviors in Coupled Micro- and Nanosystems

Though micro/nanomechanical resonators have been shown to offer distinct potential in applications ranging from resonant mass sensing to probe-based microscopy, their broad implementation is currently impeded by the comparatively-low throughput associated with isolated resonator implementations. While uncoupled resonator arrays have been proposed to overcome this throughput constraint, the signal processing and hardware requirements attendant to this approach largely negate its utility.  An alternative, and in many ways more attractive, approach, is to realize improved throughput through the active exploitation of collective behaviors arising in coupled micro/nanoresonator arrays.  This approach has the added benefit of potentially yielding improved performance metrics and/or inherent signal processing (e.g. input/output order reduction).

The proposed project, incorporating analytical, experimental, and educational outreach activities, seeks to investigate collective behaviors that arise in micro/nanoresonator arrays, which are locally- or globally-coupled through elastic, electrostatic, or electromagnetic mechanisms, in order to significantly improve their performance in emerging applications such as resonant mass sensing, electromechanical signal processing, and micromechanical neurocomputing.  The research effort will initially focus on the development of multi-physics, distributed-parameter models of representative micro/nanoresonator arrays.  These models, incorporating nonlinearities and asymmetries amongst other pertinent effects, will be systematically discretized and analyzed using standard perturbation methods. Using the results of these analyses, localized and synchronous behaviors will be identified, predictive design tools will be developed, and promising array designs distilled. Coupled microresonator arrays based on these designs will be subsequently fabricated and tested, using the fabrication and characterization suites available to the PI at Purdue University's Birck Nanotechnology Center, to verify predicted dynamic behaviors.  Ultimately, the work will develop a refined understanding of the collective and emergent behaviors associated with coupled micro/nanoresonators and, with this understanding in hand, will actively exploit these behaviors to circumvent the aforementioned throughput constraint, improve overall device performance, and spur the development of novel MEMS/NEMS devices based upon coupled array architectures.

To ensure broad impact, the proposed research effort will be hierarchically integrated with an educational effort that is founded upon the existing cyber-infrastructure of the nanoHUB - the web portal of the National Science Foundation's Network for Computational Nanotechnology, as well as Purdue University's Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program.  The PI will develop and deploy on the nanoHUB (i) a comprehensive software tool for the simulation of collective behaviors emergent in coupled micro/nanoresonator arrays; (ii) a new K-12 module on emergent micro/nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS), which emphasizes the engineer's role in micro/nanotechnology; and (iii) course materials and lectures associated with a new course on the Mechanics of Micro- and Nanosystems.  These materials will be assessed using the nanoHub's existing qualitative and quantitative evaluation tools, as well as module-specific evaluation mechanism (e.g. interactive self-tests integrated within the K-12 module). As a whole, the PI anticipates that hundreds of scientists and students worldwide will utilize these resources to further their understanding of micro/nanosystems at either an introductory or research level.  The educational effort will also incorporate a number of undergraduate research experiences arranged through Purdue University?s SURF program.

Proteins play vital structural and functional roles in cells; they are responsible for catalyzing the chemical reactions necessary for life, for the control  of both intra and inter cellular communication, for providing structural scaffolds, for acting as pores or channels through membranes and for controlling metabolism.  Protein function is normally related to protein structure. The traditional methods for deducing the structure of protein molecules involves either NMR or X-ray crystallography. While both methods are powerful they can be difficult to apply to protein found in membranes (as many key proteins are) or to aggregated proteins. Protein aggregation occurs in a wide range of diseases and also has important practical consequences for the biotech and biopharma industries. The collaborative team developed new methods based on multi-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (IR) to study the structure of this class of proteins. IR is sensitive to bond vibrations and there are certain vibrations within proteins which report on their structure. Unfortunately, limits in resolution and sensitivity have hindered the application of these methods. The collaborative team developed methods to overcome these problems and demonstrated their new approaches using a type of protein aggregate known as amyloid. The approach involved labeling a site of interest with 13C18O (heavy carbon and heavy oxygen). This shifts the vibration of interest away from the rest of the protein peaks. Two dimensional techniques were developed to provide information on the type of secondary structure formed at the labeled site; i.e. alpha-helix, vs. beta-sheet, vs. turns etc. New methods for labeling proteins had to be developed, the spectroscopic techniques required further refinement and new computational methods had to be established to analyze the resulting data and relate it to structural features. The collaborative team accomplished these goals and demonstrated them using the amyloid structures formed by islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). IAPP is a naturally occurring protein which forms amyloid in type-2 diabetes and kills the insulin producing beta cells.

The work involved considerable broader impacts and outreach. A partnership was established with a historically black college. Nemours undergraduates form Wisconsin, Stony brook and Oberlin College took part in the work. A wide range of PhD students were trained. In addition, new laboratory exercises were introduced in our first year chemistry courses.

While techniques such as x-ray crystallography have been applied to elucidate the structures of thousands of proteins, many systems (including some proteins with the greatest biological interest) are not amenable to these techniques.  This includes protein aggregates, which are implicated a range of important biological activities, but very difficult to describe structurally.

We have aimed to develop new tools of protein structure elucidation, based on the analysis of molecular vibrations.  All atoms in molecules vibrate around their bonds; these vibrations contain valuable information on the structure and environment of the molecular system.  Two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy is a tool to characterize these molecular vibrations in detail.  We have used biochemical techniques to create novel protein aggregates; measured the two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy to analyze their structures; then use computational tools and theoretical physical chemistry to refine these models further.

The primary focus of the collaborative work between Oberlin and the University of Wisconsin-Madison has been on the study of human gamma-D-crystallin, a protein found in the lens of the eye that is responsible for maintaining lens clarity and helping to focus light into the eye.  Under stress, the crystallin protein degrades and forms aggregates, which eventually lead to cataracts.  Using our novel biochemical and spectroscopic techniques, we have been able to elucidate the structure of these crystallin aggregates for the first time.  This work not only demonstrates the power of the experimental approaches we have developed, but also gives new and important insight into the molecular structures and mechanisms that underlie cataract formation.

 

In carrying out this work, we have involved undergraduate students from Oberlin, who have been active participants in all aspects of the work.  The experience on this project has been invaluable for their scientific training.  Of these students, two are now enrolled in PhD programs; one is in the chemical workforce; one is in medical school; and one is still completing his undergraduate degree (but with plans to attend graduate school).  In addition, this work has played a role in a new outreach program at Oberlin College, aimed at introducing Cleveland-area high school students to research in biology and biochemistry.  This program has served about 15 students per summer for two summers, exposing them to the topics of protein structure and physical studies of biological molecules.

Overall, we have made significant progress in developing a new approach to the study of protein aggregates; demonstrated this techniques feasibility in a system of significant biological importance; and through this work advanced the training and education of undergraduate students as well as the exposure to science of high school students.

515,"Prof. Martin Zanni at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, and collaborators James Skinner (UW-Madison), Daniel Raleigh (SUNY at Stony Brook), and Sean Decatur (Oberlin College) are supported by the Collaborative Research in Chemistry Program to devise and test methods based on two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy for characterization of protein structure and function.   The techniques are particularly important for studying systems for which NMR and x-ray crystallography are difficult to apply, such as proteins in cell membranes and protein aggregates.  The work brings together a diverse and complementary team of researchers to develop a rigorous protocol for calculating 2D IR spectra from atomistic structural models through a novel combination of theory, experiment, and synthesis.  To develop the theoretical methodology, well-characterized proteins are either isotope-labeled or mutated at individual residues so that the linewidths and/or couplings of specific residues can be measured with 2D IR spectroscopy.  

While the work is primarily directed toward developing 2D IR as a tool for protein kinetics, it can be applied to other systems as well.  Undergraduate and graduate students and postdocs involved in this study are being trained to work in a collaborative interdisciplinary and inter-institutional environment.   Participation of underrepresented groups derives from exchange programs among Oberlin, Howard University, Stony Brook, and Wisconsin.  Cyber-infrastructure components include web-conferences to discuss research progress and dissemination of user-friendly software for the theoretical calculation of spectra.  An undergraduate physical chemistry lab experiment is being developed to show how FTIR spectroscopy can be used as a tool for protein secondary structure determination; the experiment will be tested in the physical chemistry lab courses at Wisconsin, Stony Brook, Oberlin, and Howard, and then made available to the broader academic community.  Institutions that lack the needed instrumentation will be able to incorporate this experiment into their curriculum by taking advantage of the web-based remote access features being developed.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SYSTEM,21 North Park Street,MADISON,US,Madison,WI02,University of Wisconsin-Madison,WI,537151218,47.049,['James L Skinner'],09/03/2008,161202122,840000,08/31/2012,4900,CHEMISTRY PROJECTS,815000,0832584,041188822,Martin T Zanni,21 North Park Street,MADISON,US,Madison,WI02,University of Wisconsin-Madison,WI,537151218,zanni@chem.wisc.edu,Martin,Zanni,T,6082624783,kcook@nsf.gov,Kelsey D. Cook,7032927490,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Nearly everything on our planet, including ourselves, are dictated by molecules. Some are simple, like the air that we breath.  Others are complex, like the proteins that flex our muscles.  All are so small that we cannot see them with even the best light microscopes. But it is important to ""see"" them, because we need to know what they look like.  Molecules function because of their shapes.  A drug works because it fits like a key into a keyhole, locking the door to the disease. A plastic is hard, because each molecule is entwined with the others around it.  Thus, as a society, we need to know the shapes of molecules.  And since they cannot be seen, we need to devise ways of deducing their shapes.

Over the past 50 years, scientists have developed many novel ways to deduce the shapes of molecules, which scientists call molecular structure. Some methods work well on molecules that quickly tumble, like air.  Another method feels their shape with a finely tipped needle. But there is no single method that works for all molecules. Two particularly challenging classes of molecules are ones that are on surfaces, like the proteins in the walls of our cells, and molecules that move, like the proteins that flex our muscles. In these cases, and others, the best structural methods cannot be applied.  As a result, how do we design a drug to fit to it or a different molecule to wrap around it?  We would have to rely on luck. And sometimes we are lucky, but molecules are so complicated and subtle, that most often we are not.

This grant from the National Science Foundation funded a team of four researchers to develop a promising new tool for studying the structures of molecules.  The technique is called two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, because it produces an abstract picture of a molecule by the way it reflects two pulses of heat from a laser, kind of like how an ultrasound can imagine a fetus in a womanÆs uterus. What is most important, is that 2D IR spectroscopy works well where the other methods fail, such as for surface bound molecules and dynamic molecules.  Our grant was focused on learning how to better interpret the abstract picture into a molecular shape.  The interpretation is not trivial, just like the signal measured by an ultrasound probe is not actually a picture, but has to be digitally processed into an image.  We made tremendous progress.  We have now developed, arguably, the most accurate method for interpreting 2D IR spectra.  And, we have demonstrated its application to several proteins on a surface membrane, with unprecedented results. Now that it is proven, it can be applied by anyone in the world to study their particular problem at hand.  And there are lots of important applications, from fighting the influenza virus to developing new solar cells, because these types of problematic molecules exist nearly everywhere.

516,"Though resonant, electromechanical nanosystems have been shown to offer distinct potential in applications ranging from radio-frequency (RF) filtering to highly-sensitive mass sensing, their practical implementation is currently impeded by the comparatively-small output signals they produce, and by their comparatively-low quality (Q) factors of resonance.  While on-chip, low-noise amplifiers can be used to partially negate these constraints, an alternative, and in many ways more attractive approach, is to realize output signals of sufficient (usable) amplitude by exploiting dynamic phenomena, namely parametric amplification and/or parametric resonance, within the resonators themselves.  

The proposed project, incorporating both analytical and experimental activities, seeks to investigate the nonlinear dynamics and stability of parametrically-excited, high-frequency nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), such as nanotube and nanowire resonators, in order to significantly improve their performance in emerging applications such as nanomechanical, radio-frequency (RF) signal processing, nanomechanical mass detection, and ultra-fast sensing and actuation.  The research effort will initially focus on the development of multi-physics, distributed-parameter models of representative, electrostatically-actuated nanoelectromechanical devices.  These models, incorporating realistic noise sources, will be systematically discretized and analyzed using standard perturbation methods. The results of these analyses will be used to identify regions of stable and unstable operation, to develop predictive design tools, and to distill promising device designs.  Single-walled carbon nanotube resonators based on these designs will be subsequently fabricated and tested, using the fabrication and electrical characterization suites available at Purdue University?s Birck Nanotechnology Center, to verify predicted dynamic behaviors. Ultimately, the work will develop a refined understanding of the complex nonlinear behaviors associated with parametric effects at the nanoscale and, with this understanding in hand, will actively exploit these nonlinear behaviors to realize improved performance metrics and device outputs of sufficient amplitude to be of use in practical implementation.

To ensure the rapid distribution of pertinent research results, the project will leverage the cyber-infrastructure of the nanoHUB, the science portal of the NSF?s Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN), which provides online services for research, learning, and collaborations. Specifically, the PI?s will develop and deploy on the nanoHUB a comprehensive software tool for the simulation of nanotube/nanowire resonators with different geometric configurations, material properties, transduction mechanisms, and noise sources. Scientists and students working worldwide will be able to use this tool to predict the dynamic range, nonlinear phenomena, mixing/filtering, and noise effects of such resonators, leading to the better design of nanoelectromechanical systems. The online tool will be supplemented by freely-available, online user guides, tutorials, and an introductory lecture on ?Micro and Nanoresonators?. These resources, with others, will be profitably utilized in the development of a new class focusing on the dynamics of MEMS/NEMS, as well as tutorials that the PIs intend to offer at major international conferences.

This computational framework serves to interpret experimental data obtained from LE-SIMS, thereby improving the depth resolution of the technique and its ability to reliably identify organic molecular species, thus further establishing LE-SIMS as a technique for depth-profiling organic thin film materials.

The goal of this project is to establish the relationship between growth conditions, structure, and properties of multi-layer thin film organic semiconductors with unprecedented precision.

Low-energy secondary ion mass spectrometry (LE-SIMS), a specialty of the SAM group, provides a promising avenue for the analysis of organic-based thin-film layered structures, because sub-keV impact energies of the primary ions provide for a more gentle extraction of species from the surface. 

Since the processes that lead to the ejection of secondary ions at low energies was still poorly understood, which made identification of the origin of ejected species nearly impossible, we developed a computational framework consisting of large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to reproduce detailed atomic trajectories in collision cascades and predict the nature of ejected molecular fragments in view of interpreting experimental data obtained from LE-SIMS and reliably identify organic molecular species near interfaces.  With this project we gained new insights into the relationship between growth conditions, structure, and properties of multi-layer thin film organic semiconductors with unprecedented precision.

We demonstrated the usefulness of LE-SIMS for the investigation of interfacial definition and properties in materials systems involving organic semiconductor molecules by (i) establishing that roughness formation during sputtering typically is less than 1 nm, and therefore does not limit depth resolution, and (ii) that emission products indeed vary depending of the nature of the original molecule present in the sample, which thus can be identified.

We refined the molecular simulation framework for the interpretation of LE-SIMS data by improving the charge transfer feature of the reactive force field and by improving code performance on massively parallel computing platforms.  Completion of the analytical component of the simulation framework, i.e., the mapping of emission fragments onto the structure and composition of the original molecules is underway.

Insights gained from the LE-SIMS/MD simulation analyses have led to improved fabrication of organic electronic devices: cryogenic deposition temperatures lead to better definition of organic/inorganic interfaces.  Properties such as adhesion strength can be controlled in this way, which in turn governs the resistance to heat flow at the interface between metal and organic thin films, and ultimately device performance.  Accordingly, while focused on OPV structures, this project has inspired new research avenues into the design of new low-temperature thermoelectric devices.

520,"This international collaboration, between scientists at the University of Hull, UK and Kent State University having complementary expertise, focuses on understanding phenomena associated with biaxiality - the spontaneous occurrence of two distinct optical axes - in the so-called nematic phase of liquid crystals (LCs). Although it was hypothesized about 38 years ago, biaxial nematics have, until recently, proven quite elusive in real materials - indeed, virtually all nematics are optically uniaxial and virtually all applications of LCs have been restricted to the manipulation of a single optical axis. The biaxial nematic phase is expected in LCs composed of molecules (or, molecular aggregates) that are intrinsically biaxial in shape, e.g., plank-like or bent-core (banana-shaped) molecules. Another important possibility for formation of a biaxial nematic, which has been the subject of several intense theoretical investigations, arises in mixtures of disk- and rod-shaped molecules. Depending on the aspect ratios of these component molecules and on the concentration, one can expect three nematic phases, two uniaxial and one biaxial, with a specific topology of the phase diagram and interesting evolution of the nature of phase transitions. The principal investigator in the UK, Professor Georg Mehl, and his team have pioneered the synthesis of compatible rod- and disk-like systems, which form stable solutions and exhibit distinct nematic phases (possibly including a biaxial phase). The US researchers will probe the structure, optical, and other physical properties, the dynamics, and critical behavior at several interesting phase transitions between different nematic phases, both in systems with biaxial-shaped molecules and in rod-disc mixtures.

The results and the data acquired under this project will help test the validity of the current theories and provide important insight into the physics and chemistry of novel LC materials. The researchers will employ state-of-the-art techniques such as dynamic light scattering, synchrotron x-ray diffraction, confocal and atomic force microscopies, and electro-optical measurements in their investigations. The results of this project are likely to have transformative impact on the industry via the emergence of a new display technology and other applications of optically biaxial fluids. Undergraduate and graduate students and postdocs will be trained in an area that has the potential of impacting the fields of photonics, telecommunications, and cyber infrastructure. Junior researchers will have opportunities to interact and forge long-term professional contacts with members of the research group in the UK and other international scholars at the Advanced Photon Source. US graduate students and postdocs will be able to diversify their skills and scientific experience and begin their careers with a profound appreciation for materials development as well as physical characterization.",NSF,4900,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER,KENT,US,Kent,OH13,Kent State University,OH,442420001,47.049,['Samuel N Sprunt'],06/25/2008,041071101,510000,08/31/2012,4900,SOLID STATE & MATERIALS CHEMIS,510000,0806991,041071101,Satyendra  Kumar,OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER,KENT,US,Kent,OH13,Kent State University,OH,442420001,skumar@kent.edu,Satyendra,Kumar,,3306722566,stamchan@nsf.gov,Suk-Wah Tam-Chang,7032928684,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The focus of this research has been to find and understand the properties of a new liquid crystal (LC) phase, referred to as the biaxial nematic LC. This is very similar to the uniaxial nematic LC materials used in flat panel computer and television displays, and cell phones. The new LC is predicted to be 100 times faster than the current technology, with unique optical properties that also make it very versatile and suitable for technological applications other than displays. The fundamental requirement is that their basic entity (molecules or nanoscale assembly of molecules) have the proper shape and symmetry to organize, on a larger scale, into the new phase. Molecules having banana or plank-like shape, or resembling an eating fork meet the basic requirements. During this project, especially synthesized and selected materials were used which included: tetrapodic systems in which four individual rod shaped molecules were tethered to an anchor atom giving them an effective rectangular shape, obliquely hydrogen bonding molecules giving them a statistical biaxial shape, and water solutions of (chromonic) plank-shaped dye molecules. The materials not commercially available were obtained from research collaborators at the University of Hull (UK), Center for Soft Materials Research (India), and from industry partners.

State-of-the-art dynamic light scattering and synchrotron x-ray diffraction, and other experimental techniques were employed to obtain valuable information which revealed the connections between molecular architecture and the LC phases formed. The tetrapodic system showed the two nematic and one more complex phase with previously unknown features. The hydrogen-bonded molecules also formed a phase that resembled the new nematic phase. The work on chromonic materials revealed that several long held beliefs pertaining to their assembly into columns followed by the formation of LC phases were not substantiated and their theoretical description needs amendments. Our results provided a better quantitative understanding of them. The pharmaceutical systems were also found to form LC structures during the processes used in drug formulations. These were important findings that improved our scientific understanding of the new LC phase and these materials.

This research project enabled the training of several highly skilled workers in the STEM area. Five graduate students and four postdoctoral scholars were mentored and trained in the conduct of research and preparation of manuscripts and professional presentations for dissemination of results. Four graduate students completed their PhD degrees. Three of the students and two postdocs were female. Two of the group members accepted faculty positions at the level equivalent to associate professor and now have their own teaching and research programs. Two are employed as researchers at a major company specializing in liquid crystal technology, and three are currently pursuing research as postdoctoral scholars. One student is in a process of completing his PhD.

This research award by the National Science Foundation afforded the project team members an opportunity for international collaboration involving exchange of scientific materials, skills, and ideas. Results were disseminated via a total of 24 publications and presentations at professional conferences. One patent (No. 7,604,850) on ""biaxial nematic liquid crystal electrooptical devices"" was awarded by the US Patent and Trademark Offfice. The scientific outcomes of this project held significant importance for a major display manufacturer that provided a grant specifically to explore the potential of their use in fast display devices adding to the broader impact of the activities undertaken with support from the National Science Foundation.

Title: ORCHID: Harnessing Digital Evolution in Design High-Assurance Adaptive Systems

PIs: Betty Cheng, Philip McKinley, Charles Ofria, and Xiaobo Tan

A robust cyber-infrastructure must be able to monitor the environment and its own behavior, adapt to changing conditions, and protect itself from component failures.  The hallmark of the Orchid project is to introduce the fundamental biological principle, evolution, into the development process for adaptive real-world software systems.  The project will use and extend the Avida digital evolution software platform to address three primary tasks: (1) exploiting the automatic generation of software models and search capacity of digital evolution to enable the developer to identify viable system configurations; (2) generating novel strategies to adapt from one system behavior to another in response to changing environmental conditions; and (3) providing assurance for adaptive systems by revealing latent properties within a given configuration in order to distinguish generated configurations and remove unwanted behavior.  A prototype system will be developed and used to conduct an experimental case study in the design of self-adaptive aquatic mobile sensor networks for homeland security and environmental monitoring.  In addition, an instructional system, Avida-EDAS, will be developed to enable students to evolve models of adaptive software, conduct experiments to assess the impact of adverse environmental conditions, and observe the effects of different adaptation strategies on system execution.",NSF,4900,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,Office of Sponsored Programs,East Lansing,US,East Lansing,MI08,Michigan State University,MI,488242600,47.070,"['Philip K McKinley', 'Charles A Ofria', 'Xiaobo  Tan']",06/13/2008,193247145,600000,06/30/2013,4900,SOFTWARE FOR REAL-WORLD SYSTMS,600000,0820220,,Betty  Cheng,Office of Sponsored Programs,East Lansing,US,East Lansing,MI08,Michigan State University,MI,488242600,chengb@cse.msu.edu,Betty,Cheng,,5173558344,sgreensp@nsf.gov,Sol J.

522,"A highly publicized report by the American Cancer Society noted that cancer has surpassed heart disease to become the number one killer of adults under the age of 85 in the United States today. At the top of the list was lung cancer, a disease that is eminently preventable. Addressing public health threats like cancer are acute, system-wide challenges that would benefit from network-centric approaches. For example, when the tobacco research community realized it had taken over a decade to discover that they had already collected substantial empirical evidence, distributed across its network of tobacco researchers, indicating that 'light' (low-tar/low-nicotine brands) cigarettes reduced neither exposure to nor risk of cancer, researchers began to understand the importance of effectively sharing resources and information across the entire community. In response, government agencies involved in public health have made a substantial foundational investment in developing a digital government cyberinfrastructure--Tobacco Systems integration Grid (TobacSIG)--to enable collaboration within the Tobacco Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Evaluation Network (TSEEN). While such an underlying cyberinfrastructure is a prerequisite, delays in discoveries (such as the carcinogenic effects of 'light' cigarette mentioned above) have prompted the TSEEN community to underscore the need for social network referral tools as a crucial component of any effort to enhance the efficacy of their collaboration system.

This project will develop, deploy and assess  social networking tools to enhance collaboration among members of TSEEN using the TobacSIG cyberinfrastructure. The proposed project brings together researchers in information science, social science, and public health who have established strong collaborations with government partners on the development of networks to support transdisciplinary research in public health. The researchers have assisted the government partners in formulating the challenges and envisioning solutions; hence the research team is will positioned to leverage the substantial financial and human resources being invested by NIH National Cancer Institute and its partner government agencies in the TobacSIG cyberinfrastructure.

Intellectual Merit: The proposed project is a pioneering effort at incorporating social network referral tools as an integral part of collaborative systems within the context of digital government. First, the proposed project will extend theoretical understanding of the emergence of collaboration network structures involving multidimensional networks, where nodes may be individuals, documents, data sets, services (such as visual-analytic tools), or keywords/concepts. Second, it will pioneer theory development and testing about the influence of network referral systems on collaboration outcomes. Specifically, the proposed project will assess the extent to which collaboration outcomes are influenced by (i) different theoretically-derived structures of network referrals, (ii) different incentive structures provided to users of the network referral system, (iii) different types of network data used to generate referrals, and (iv) different information visualizations used to represent network referrals. Third, the research will extend the exponential random graph modeling techniques that have been largely used to estimate structural dependencies in relatively small (typically no larger than 500) one-dimensional networks. The proposed project will extend these techniques to multidimensional networks containing over 10,000 nodes.

Broader Impacts: As cyberinfrastructure is deployed to support collaboration among large  communities in government and elsewhere, it is increasingly obvious that social network tools have immense potential. In this project the researchers will seek to respond to the refrain 'if only the Tobacco Surveillance  Epidemiology Evaluation Network knew what it knew.' Generalizing the relevance of this same refrain to a wide spectrum of other contexts is suggestive of the broader impacts of the proposed research. The findings and deliverables of the proposed research will be immediately generalizable to the design and deployment of social network referral tools to support collaboration among other digital government efforts within public health and beyond. Further, the government and non-government partners in this project  are exceptionally well-equipped to incorporate into their regularly scheduled education, training, and outreach workshops the skill sets of collaborative fluency afforded by the judicious use of network referral systems. Finally, by definition, social network referral systems have the potential to increase the likelihood of drawing in more diverse constituents within the public health community (in terms of gender, ethnicity, age, seniority, disciplinary perspectives) than heretofore possible. This extended network will also offer opportunities for mentoring of previously disadvantaged members within these communities.",NSF,4900,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,1801 Maple Ave.,Evanston,US,Evanston,IL09,Northwestern University,IL,602013149,47.070,,06/03/2008,160079455,575624,02/29/2012,4900,INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS,860774,0836262,005436803,Noshir S Contractor,1801 Maple Ave.,Evanston,US,Evanston,IL09,Northwestern University,IL,602013149,nosh@northwestern.edu,Noshir,Contractor,S,8474913669,@nsf.gov,,,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The goals of the TSEEN project and its supplements were are to develop and assess proof-of-concept implementations of collaboration tools to enable, expand and extend tobacco control

research and policy work. As part of this project, in close collaboration with tobacco researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) as well as those funded by NCI, we developed a prototype portal called the Tobacco Behavioral Informatics Grid (ToBIG).  ToBIG provided the tobacco control research community and environment to share documents, data sets, analytic tools, and other information resources (Figure 1). To facilitate connecting researchers with other researchers as well as other relevant resources, we built CI-KNOW (Cyber Infrastructure for Knowledge Networks On the Web) recommender system to be integrated with this portal. CI-KNOW provides a unique method for locating relevant resources based on structural connections that exist among information resources and ToBIG users. Based on the feedback received from the community, we have extended the development of CI-KNOW to make it scalable and generalizable to other research communities. In particular, we recognized that CI-KNOW recommender systems can be implemented and scaled rapidly by leveraging the increasing amount of that is being made available in the linked open data (RDF) format.

  

The results of our efforts in enabling the tobacco research community prompted our collaborators at the NCI to generalize our approach to the larger population science community. In response, we collaborated with researchers at the NCI as well as influential population science researchers identified by NCI to develop a prototype version of the PopSciGrid (Population Sciences Grid). The primary goal of the PopSciGrid was to facilitate researchers to conduct analyses across multiple data sets with minimal effort. For instance, we were able to demonstrate how a researcher could use the PopSciGrid to evaluate the effect of tobacco taxes - which is available in one data set - in a certain region on the amount individuals smoked in that region which is available in multiple data sets from different national surveys (Figure 2).

 

 

The ease of access to data via the PopSciGrid led our collaborators at NCI to explore the potential of making these visual analytic tools available not just to the research community but to the public at large. To demonstrate this potential, we implemented a prototype version of the PopSciGrid2 which utilized the vast amount of data available in the linked open data format. In PopSciGrid2 we developed interactive tools to visualize geographically as well as dynamically the relationships between the prevalence of smoking, cigarette taxes and laws prohibiting smoking in certain areas (Figures 3 and 4).

 

 

 

In summary, this project advanced our understanding of the social as well as technological mechanisms that enable more efficient and effective networking both among researchers as well as the general public interested in learning more about certain areas of research.

Title: CAREER: Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks in Process Control

This is a CAREER grant to fund research and educational activities aimed at using wireless sensors and actuators to control industrial chemical processes.

Intellectual merit

Existing process control systems rely on sensors, actuators and controllers that are connected via dedicated, wired control networks to reliably achieve critical control objectives such as stability, robustness and set-point tracking.  Recently, the convergence of innovations in actuator and sensor technologies, wireless communications and digital electronics has led to the availability of low-cost wireless sensors and actuators that can be easily deployed and interfaced with the existing control systems.  Augmenting pre-existing process control systems with additional wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs) creates new opportunities for enhancing and expanding the capabilities of process control technology through high density sensing and actuation, as well as deployments in unsafe areas that may be impossible to instrument with wired approaches.  The availability of more sensor data, more actuation capabilities and more intercommunication between plant units enables the attainment of goals that cannot be achieved with existing control systems including proactive fault-tolerance and real-time plant reconfiguration to accommodate market demand changes.  These goals are aligned with the emerging paradigm in process control and operations dealing with the development of ?smart plant? solutions. 

Realizing this potential requires handling the fundamental challenges that this new technology introduces from a control point of view.  Low-cost WSANs are often resource constrained, with limited power, computation and communication capabilities, and may occasionally be unreliable due to interference in the field, device failure, or environmental impact.  These two real-world limitations can significantly limit the performance and flexibility benefits of WSANs if not accounted for in the controller design framework.  Motivated by this, the objective of the proposed research is to resolve the fundamental issues associated with the deployment of wireless sensor and actuator networks in chemical plants for the purpose of augmenting existing process control systems to improve closed-loop system performance. 

To achieve this objective, a number of projects are planned, including: (1) the development of model-based control,1 estimation and scheduling strategies that achieve the desired closed-loop performance with optimal use of WSAN resources, (2) the development of robust control methods that handle communication disruptions and the unreliability of the wireless communication medium, (3) application of the networked control, estimation and scheduling methods to large-scale chemical plants and distributed fuel cell networks used in distributed energy generation, and (4) integration of the research results into education and outreach activities.  In addition to the networked analysis and control methods, this research will provide a fundamental understanding of the capabilities and limitations of WSANs in augmenting process control systems, give insight into the tradeoffs that exist between control and communications, and address practical implementation issues for managing these tradeoffs.

Broader Impact 

Augmenting existing process control systems with WSANs is an important step towards realizing the vision of a smart reconfigurable plant which utilizes advanced cyber-infrastructure and communication technologies to tightly integrate process control and operations with real-time process information.  There is a wide range of industrial processes that could benefit including large-scale chemical plants and fuel cell networks where the deployment of WSANs has the potential to enhance and expand existing control technology.  To transfer the results and insight of the research into the industrial sector, the PI plans to seek collaborations with industry, organize tutorials and workshops both at UC Davis and in the context of major control conferences, and develop user-friendly software that will facilitate the practical implementation of the developed methods. 

A number of activities are planned to integrate the research with education, including incorporation of research results into undergraduate and graduate-level process control courses, writing the first research monograph on networked process control, undergraduate student participation in research in collaboration with the NSF- funded California Alliance for Minority Participation program at UC Davis, the development of a Process Control Breadboard system to facilitate curriculum integration as well as outreach to high-school and college students from under-represented groups.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS",OR/Sponsored Programs,Davis,US,Davis,CA03,University of California-Davis,CA,956186134,47.041,,11/27/2007,047120084,403083,12/31/2013,4900,PROCESS & REACTION ENGINEERING,403083,0747954,071549000,Nael H El-Farra,OR/Sponsored Programs,Davis,US,Davis,CA03,University of California-Davis,CA,956186134,nhelfarra@ucdavis.edu,Nael,El-Farra,H,5307546919,@nsf.gov,,,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,"['Sun, YL;El-Farra, NH~Quasi-decentralized networked control of process systems~American Control Conference 2008~ ~2008~~1507~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=173086984#000259261501030']","['Hu, Y. and N.

Engineering of systems or processes, in which the properties of the final product depend on phenomena that occur at different length and time scales, has emerged as a grand challenge for research aimed at the development of high performance materials. Polymer and polymer matrix composite industries account for 15% of the manufacturing segment of the Gross Domestic Product and can greatly benefit from multiscale computational models  integrating information from the molecular, mesoscopic, and continuum length scales. To date, such models have been based on macroscopic conservation laws incapable of accurately predicting the necessary structure-property-performance relationships. This research will initiate and catalyze  this  much-needed multiscale process model transformation to a computer-based product development through the establishment of a prototype virtual engineering organization for facilitation of collaborations between domestic and international partners. This will lead to rapid new discoveries and the virtually instantaneous dissemination of new developments in this field. The intellectual merits of the virtual organization is the development of a prototype network of international collaborators, connected virtually through a primary server/distribution site dedicated to the project. This site will serve as a hub for passing simulation codes and simulation/experimental data, visualization of data intensive systems, ensuring compatibility of codes and software among various platforms, and allow for a pooling of computational resources at the allied institutions for shared usage. It will create and disseminate multiscale engineering tools to enrich engineering curricula and to aid industrial process engineers. In the broader impacts context, such an organization can resolve and test management and organizational structures, cyber-infrastructure effectiveness, and middleware application/development for full implementation and replication in other areas of engineering practice. Prototype virtual organizations can thus have a profound effect on the future direction, structure, and the strategic implementation of universally accessible large-scale virtual engineering networks.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE,1 CIRCLE PARK,KNOXVILLE,US,Knoxville,TN02,University of Tennessee Knoxville,TN,379960003,47.041,"['Eric Stefan G Shaqfeh', 'Bamin  Khomami', 'Jay D Schieber', 'David J Keffer']",10/26/2007,003387891,189959,10/31/2009,4900,CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE,189959,0742679,003387891,Brian J Edwards,1 CIRCLE PARK,KNOXVILLE,US,Knoxville,TN02,University of Tennessee Knoxville,TN,379960003,bje@utk.edu,Brian,Edwards,J,8659749596,@nsf.gov,,,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,"['J.M.

The wireless access network on top of the optical core network is an important ideal architecture for such a target. Indeed, the optical network in core provides the efficient high-speed communication with high bandwidth and the wireless network in access provides mobile communication with flexible deployment. The advantage of fiber-optical backbone network

Today there are a large amount of network resources and also a large amount of traffic. Therefore, efficient utilization of network resources becomes a very important task, which has impact in survivability, energy efficiency, and quality of service (QoS).

We propose an integrated research project that studies various optimization problems on (a) resilience schemes, including protection and restoration

""""Representation and Learning of Musical expression in Melody""""
PI: Christopher S. Raphael
Indiana University


ABSTRACT

Music exists on several levels. One view is in terms of the directly observable attributes of a musical score, such as notes and rhythms written in traditional symbolic music notation by a composer. Another view is in terms of the audio stream corresponding to an expressive rendering of the score. Between these two extremes--the atomic sub-components and an expressive performance--there are many levels. Only some of these have well-developed representations and analyses. The goal of this project is to develop a representation of an intermediate layer that can explain the association between the lowest note level and the top expressive level and to develop a system for expressive rendering of continuously controlled music that will begin with melody represented as a note list with an analysis of the harmonic structure and produce an expressive audio corresponding to a performance of it. To achieve this goal, the project aims to develop a representation for capturing the expressive elements of the notes--their prosodic function--for instance, their implicit musical direction and stress. The project will also study the relationship between this mid-level representation and continuous audio in an actual rendition of the music. For this aspect, the project will employ a """"Theramin"""" model for audio that continuously modulates the pitch and amplitude of a sinusoidal tone. Such a model is capable of representing a variety of expressive musical elements including dynamics and vibrato.

This project will pursue the following specific tasks: (1) development of a small corpus of expression-annotated music; (2) development of a system for automatically computing the prosodic annotation from the symbolic melody and harmony representations; and (3) development of a system for automatically generating the Theramin representations from prosodically annotated melody and harmony. The use of machine learning methods will be employed in this project to predict Theramin representations that resemble those of a training corpus; these will also be used in evaluation.",NSF,4900,TRUSTEES OF INDIANA UNIVERSITY,509 E 3RD ST,Bloomington,US,Bloomington,IN09,Indiana University,IN,474013654,47.070,,08/31/2007,006046700,,02/28/2009,4900,ROBUST INTELLIGENCE,50000,0739563,006046700,Christopher S Raphael,509 E 3RD ST,Bloomington,US,Bloomington,IN09,Indiana University,IN,474013654,craphael@indiana.edu,Christopher,Raphael,S,8128561849,@nsf.gov,,,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,['Christopher Raphael and Eric Nichols~Linear Dynamic Programming and the Training of Sequence Estimators~Operations Research and Cyber-Infrastructure (Proc. of INFORMS Computing Society)~~2009~219~~10.1007/978-0-387-88843-9~0~ ~0~ ~25/09/2016 15:08:38.906000000'],09/01/2007,Representation and Learning of Musical Expression in Melody,Grant
528,"The U.S. is facing serious challenges in the fields of science and technology and our future engineers must use innovation to generate new products, create employment opportunities, and strengthen the national economy. Furthermore, the existing connections between cognitive science and engineering are nationally quite small. This study provides a much needed diverse set of investigators to bridge knowledge across these areas. 
Engineering design is a rich interplay of physical and mental. Successful design engineers move from ideas to completed designs using artifacts and tools. Over the past several decades, the number of tools and artifacts available to engineers has become nearly limitless. These tools include drawing programs, quantitative modeling software, sketch paper, computer aided design programs, and prototyping facilities. Despite their importance for supporting creativity and innovative ideas, little is presently known about how tools differentially support innovative design. A lack of knowledge how these tools impact innovative design limits improvements to tools and practical knowledge of how and when to use those tools in design.
The goal of the current study is to begin to build a fundamental understanding of the cognitive processes underlying the role of tools and artifacts in the innovative design process, by combining strengths in cognitive science research and innovative design education (Swanson Center for Product Innovation) at the University of Pittsburgh. A large-scale experiment that examines the ways in which artifacts and tools contribute to innovative design is conducted. This experiment is used to collect a massive database of design activities, consisting of approximately 3,000 hours of video from approximately 60 undergraduate and graduate-level engineering design teams using cyber-infrastructure for video collection leveraged through this grant. The video is then strategically sampled to unpack the causal path from design/tools artifacts in the environment, to core cognitive processes underlying design, to dimensions of design creativity, to the ultimate success of the designed object. In addition, new engineering design innovativeness metrics are developed, validated, and refined. The merit of this study lies within the fact that such a comprehensive study on the learning of design tools and artifacts will substantially expand the understanding of the fundamental processes involved in this important, but often overlooked field.
At the completion of this study, it is expected that the knowledge gained will allow the investigators to lead the development of a new suite of design tools and strategies for supporting practicing engineers and educating engineering students. These tools and strategies could have far reaching implications as they could initiate substantial changes in design practice and engineering design education. This study also involves an enormous data collection effort. The resulting video database will provide volumes of data on the role of tools and artifacts in innovative design, only a small portion of which is to be analyzed during the grant period. This video database will foster considerable follow-up analyses for years to come. The resulting video database will be disseminated throughout the academic community.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH THE,University Club,Pittsburgh,US,Pittsburgh,PA14,University of Pittsburgh,PA,152132303,47.075,['Michael R Lovell'],08/28/2007,004514360,,06/30/2010,4900,SCIENCE OF SCIENCE POLICY,448717,0738071,004514360,Christian D Schunn,University Club,Pittsburgh,US,Pittsburgh,PA14,University of Pittsburgh,PA,152132303,schunn@pitt.edu,Christian,Schunn,D,4126248807,@nsf.gov,,,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,"['Schunn, C.

529,"This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by Prof. Paul Chirik at Cornell University to develop new iron catalysts for selective organic transformations. The approach seeks to elucidate the electronic structure of bis(imino)pyridine iron derivatives and apply this knowledge to the synthesis of new, more environmentally responsible compounds that are active catalysts for the formation of C-H, C-C and C-Si bonds.  The research will explore the electronic structure and catalytic activity of new structural types such as iron imides, nitrides, diazoalkane complexes and alkylidenes in order to develop catalytic systems that would replace toxic and expensive precious metals with cheaper, more environmentally benign iron compounds. 

This research will be carried out in collaboration with Prof. Karl Wieghardt at the Max Plank Institute for Bioinorganic Chemistry in Mulheim, Germany.  Students and postdocs involved in the project will spend time in laboratories at both Cornell and the Max Plank Institute and be exposed to complementary activities in synthesis, spectroscopy and computational methods.

The Conference will be preceded by a two-day Summer School, where several distinguished scholars will offer classes on selected topics in continuous optimization for advanced graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The goal of the Conference is threefold: (a) to provide a focused forum for US and international researchers and practitioners to facilitate the rapid exchange of state-of-the-art results and promising ideas within continuous optimization, (b) to offer educational opportunities to graduate students and junior researchers to learn about the latest developments in continuous optimization, and (c) to encourage women and minority researchers to work in this important area of Operations Research and Computational Science.  This project is supported by the Operations Research Program of the Civil, Mechanical & Manufacturing Innovation Division, and the Office of International Science and Engineering.

Optimization has evolved over the past four decades into a thriving discipline that has strong theoretical underpinnings and plays a major role in many practical application areas.  As the need for improved operation of many physical and scientific systems arises, the role of optimization techniques is growing quickly.  The conference will provide a stimulus for sustained research in continuous optimization, while the summer school will have a particular emphasis on high-performance computational optimization.

531,"This project details a joint US-Japan partnership focused on development and nanoscale understanding of amorphous-/crystalline phase transitions for semiconductor device applications through combinatorial materials exploration (CME). Two classes of materials where control of the amorphous-crystalline transition is relevant for new device structures are examined. Intrinsic vacancy chalcogenides, whose dramatic change in resistance between the amorphous and crystalline state is proposed as a basis for high-density non-volatile memory, is be the focus of the US-based team.  Metal alloy gate materials, whose variation in work function with crystal face is a limiting factor in uniform response of nanoscale electronics, is be the focus of the Japan-based part of the team.  In both cases, optimization of relevant device properties requires careful consideration of the nanoscale interplay between stoichiometry and structure in controlling the dynamics and energetics of the amorphous-crystalline transition.  

In this project, the US-Team, consisting of scientists from the University of Washington, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and Micron Technology Inc., will work in close cooperation with researchers at the National Institute of Materials Science (NIMS, Japan) to develop: (1) a fundamental framework for amorphous-crystalline stabilization and transition relevant to future semiconductor device technologies; (2) new designs for combinatorial materials exploration that vary both composition and processing on single samples, and (3) a combinatorial informatics protocol to establish fruitful mechanisms for data sharing among different institutions. The collaboration will facilitate information exchange on materials relevant to semiconductor device technologies and provide a new paradigm of materials exploration as an educational program for both senior undergraduate and graduate students. Advancement of CME methodology will build upon and expand current cyber infrastructure capabilities, such as remote use of instrumentation, database creation and utility, visualization, and virtual networking and experimentation, anticipating progress across a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines with dramatic impacts on the society beyond the semiconductor industries. Students participating in this research will gain exposure to these new methodologies and also will experience multiple research environments academia (University of Washington), industry (Micron Technologies) and both US and Japanese national laboratories (PNNL and NIMS).

The program goal is to gain a deeper understanding of flow-induced crystallization of polymers. These advances include rheo-optical experiments under shear, rheo-optical experiments under uniaxial extension, and modeling with several of the most advanced rheological constitutive equations for predicting flow-induced molecular stretch and orientation. 

A unique optical micro-rheometer and a novel filament stretching extensional rheometer, recently obtained under an NSF MRI grant, are capable of simultaneously measuring the evolution of stress and material structure as a function of time and accumulated strain in homogeneous shear and extensional flows. Simultaneous observation of light scattering, microscopy, fluorescence, and birefringence from the sample make it possible to obtain time-correlated structural information of the polymer melts. These new instruments were designed for studies on very small samples at the large shear and extension rates often encountered in polymer processing. They will allow polymer crystallization exploration by facilitating the first simultaneous measurements of stress and crystal structure growth in response to homogenous shear flows, homogeneous uniaxial extensional flows, and precisely controlled sequential homogeneous shear and uniaxial extensional flows. 

Modeling the effect of strain on the polymer conformation and stretch will use newly developed cyber infrastructure (computer aided) methods that have become available by combining rheological experiments with molecular theory for non-linear viscoelasticity. Advanced molecular dynamics theories will predict the flow-induced molecular stretch and orientation in polymer melts of various molecular topology (linear, short-chain branched, stars, pom-pom) and various molecular weight distributions. Model predictions might be able to classify crystallization dynamics at large stresses and strains and connect the observations back to the molecular architecture. 

Intellectual Merit: The proposed flow-induced polymer crystallization research represents a strong synergy between newly developed experimental techniques and facilities and state-of-the-art constitutive models and theories to explore the stress and structure of fluids near the gel point. A series of well-designed experiments will be performed into several key areas of quiescent crystallization and flow-induced crystallization of polymer melts. Strong homogenous shear and extensional flows will be used to explore the role of shear rate, extension rate, strain, strain energy, and branching on the rate of crystal nucleation and growth of polymer melts. 

Broader Impacts: The proposed research can have significant impact on a host of commercial applications from facilitating the design of materials with application specific properties to reducing the time and cost of manufacturing polymer based parts. These advances require not only a detailed understanding of the role of shear and extensional flows on the crystallization process, but the development of processing protocols and equipment which can precisely control the dynamics of crystallization. In addition, the proposed work will enhance education, by including both graduate and undergraduate students in the research project. The college's successful Minority Engineering Program will help involve underrepresented groups in the proposed research. Cyberinfrastructure (CI) students will directly access several of the world's most advanced theories of polymer dynamics. The combination of experimental techniques and the CI constitutes a powerful teaching tool to share with faculty of Northeast Alliance for Graduate Education Partner (NEAGE) institutions. Dr. Estevez (U. of Puerto Rico) will collaborate in the development of CI modules specifically designed for implementation in his materials science curriculum. With the aid of the NEAGE, he will visit UMass Amherst to learn more about the CI platform and the proposed experiments and will then integrate them into his courses.

Abstract
Hydrologic science has evolved to embrace scientists from a diverse range of disciplines, driven by the many challenging problems that now exist at the interface of various science disciplines,. Tremendous strides have been made but the enormous complexity of the problems continues to pose challenges for predicting interactions among the physical, biological, biogeochemical, and human subsystems that shape the behavior of hydrologic systems, especially in the context of human-induced changes to climate and land use. Predictions focused on individual components or unchanging landscapes or climate are no longer deemed satisfactory. The changing environment therefore provides both a challenge and an opportunity for developing sound foundations for improving the predictability of water cycle dynamics through an approach based on a synthesis of observations, analysis methods, concepts and theories across a broad range of scientific fields, including hydrology, ecology, geomorphology, geochemistry, and the social sciences, in a manner sufficient to meet the water challenges we now face and will face in the future. The aim of this project is to conduct a range of synthesis activities that will produce transformational outcomes in the critical research area of ""improving predictability of water cycle dynamics in a changing environment,"" which will serve as an effective model of synthesis within the hydrological community. This objective will be achieved by through the formation of a targeted synthesis team and associated synthesis activity groups, and through these groups, carrying out focused research activities to generate outcomes that will serve as national prototypes of the power of synthesis for investigating and solving complex hydrologic problems. The synthesis activities will consist of a mix of workshops, small-group research activities, combined with the use of cyber-infrastructure. To undertake this project, a research consortium has been formed consisting of several established research centers as partners (NCED, HWR/SAHRA, NCAR, NCEAS, IRI, NCSA) with UIUC acting as the hub. Membership of the synthesis team and synthesis activity groups will be open to partner organizations as well as the general scientific community.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS,SUITE A,CHAMPAIGN,US,Champaign,IL13,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,IL,618207473,47.050,"['Bruce L Rhoads', 'Donald J Wuebbles', 'Praveen  Kumar']",05/31/2007,041544081,875000,10/31/2013,4900,HYDROLOGIC SCIENCES,956258,0636043,041544081,Murugesu  Sivapalan,SUITE A,CHAMPAIGN,US,Champaign,IL13,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,IL,618207473,sivapala@illinois.edu,Murugesu,Sivapalan,,2173332675,ttorgers@nsf.gov,Thomas Torgersen,7032924738,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Human activity in todayÆs world is beginning to rival geologic-scale forces. The main challenge to predictions in such a changing environment involves understanding interacting earth system processes that have led to the structure and function of existing hydrologic systems, and to use this understanding to predict how they will evolve in the context of rapid human-induced changes. Increasingly predictions must include the implications of human behavior, understanding legacy effects of past behavior, and the emergent behavior of human-impacted hydrological systems.

Addressing such prediction problems generation of new understanding and new prediction approaches that build on a synthesis of knowledge and concepts from diverse disciplines that impinge on the dynamics of such interacting subsystems. This project was aimed at exploring alternative approaches to bring about such inter-disciplinary synthesis. In this project we experimented with several approaches and strategies to achieve these objectives: (1) detailed projects addressing traditional questions in the areas of catchment ecohydrology and biogeochemistry, where we leveraged graduate student time and enthusiasm through extended summer projects, and (2) community leadership in terms of developing a forward-thinking research agenda for water research.

The project has resulted in more than 112 peer-reviewed publications and has contributed to an extensive, yet cohesive body of work. In particular, we we can claim the following specific contributions to the community. We have provided      leadership in global change through coordinating efforts to develop a new vision for      hydrology under new contexts and paradigms, and a new research agenda      focused on changes in hydrology and society, and the promotion of the new scientific subfield of socio-hydrology. Our research has contributed to improved      understanding and prediction of the inter-annual variability of catchment water      balance and the buffering role of vegetation. We have contributed to enhancing      our understanding of biogeochemical cycling at watershed scale through new      insights gained into up-scaling from the reach scale. Our project team has helped to design artificial hillslopes for a major, long-term experiment now operational at      Biosphere 2 near Tucson,       Arizona. In addition to these scientific advances, the project has trained scores of young scientists, including more than 20 PhD students, in inter-disciplinary research, some of whom have gone on to lead successful careers themselves.

534,"This award is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER).  Many scientific and engineering research communities are developing large multidisciplinary collaborations to develop cyberinfrastructure (CI).   The goal of CI is to create virtual environments, where researchers and educators can access distributed resources (e.g., computational tools and services, instruments, experiments, and data).  Although CI initiatives are expected to have a significant impact on research productivity and there is considerable enthusiasm around the promise of CI, there has been little systematic evaluation of CI initiatives to date. This project is a pilot study to conduct an evaluation of the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) CI.   NEES became operational in 2004 as a shared use experimental and cyber infrastructure for the earthquake engineering and related communities.  At the heart of NEES is ""NEESit,"" the NEES cyberinfrastructure center that develops, deploys, and operates the set of CI systems and applications used to link earthquake engineers across the United States with leading-edge computational resources, research equipment (i.e., the fifteen NEES equipment sites), simulation and visualization tools, and collaborators to plan, perform, and publish experiments.  NEES is managed by NEES Consortium, Inc. (NEESinc), through NSF cooperative agreement CMMI-0402490, who oversees both NEES equipment sites and NEESit.  The NEES CI evaluation has two objectives: (1) to examine how NEES CI facilitates researcher access to distributed resources and the impact such access has on research productivity, and (2) to inform ongoing and future CI-based initiatives.  In order to accomplish both objectives, the evaluation is designed to not only assess NEES CI, but also provide assessment data to benchmark NEES CI against other NSF-funded CI-based environments (e.g. TeraGrid, LEAD, and WATERS  Network).  Evaluation methods include interviews, observations of scientists and engineers at work, surveys, and bibliometrics.

This project includes an examination and evaluation of mechanisms within NEES that support CI use in general, and knowledge sourcing and multi-site researcher collaboration activities, specifically. Contributions of this work include improved theoretical understanding of how CI can function to enhance these activities, practical suggestions about the design of CI to facilitate them, and specific feedback about how NEES CI is aiding them within the earthquake engineering community.  CI is a major NSF investment on many fronts.  This project's evaluation methodology will follow those used to investigate the same phenomena in different NSF-funded CI-based environments.  This approach will help assimilate findings with other CI research communities, which means the lessons learned and promising practices identified in the course of specific evaluations can inform the design of CI-based environments more generally.   Results will be disseminated through presentations at conferences and workshops as well as publications that are relevant to scholars, policy makers, and NEES stakeholders.

535,"MSPnet Phase II is a facilitated electronic learning network serving the MSP community from 2008-2011. This network will continue the functionality of the current MSPnet, while undertaking substantial new initiatives and expanding its reach to serve newly funded Institute and RETA projects. MSPnet Phase II builds on the very successful current MSP learning network, which has had over 319,000 visits (from 190,000 unique visitors) and has served over one million page views. It is accessed by all 71 currently funded NSF MSP projects, and serves each project by collecting, sharing, and disseminating research, resources, and tools generated by Comprehensive, Targeted, Institute, and RETA MSP efforts. Furthermore, it is used as an effective dissemination vehicle sharing selected research and resources with The Department of Education's MSP program as well as the public at large.
MSPnet Phase II will ensure that all MSP projects will benefit from an electronic learning network that facilitates sharing within and between projects.    MSPnet will continue to play an important role in the MSP efforts to synthesize research and lessons learned from projects as they reach maturity.  This will ensure that an online archive will be accessible to researchers, future STEM programs, and the public. 

MSPnet Phase II will:
.	Increase and sustain members' awareness of activities, events, accomplishments, and conferences related to the MSP community at large;
.	Increase and sustain sharing and access to resources, tools, research, and conference archives between MSP projects;
.	Increase and sustain communication of partners and constituents within MSP projects;
.	Enable the continued dissemination of activities, resources and findings to related programs such as the Department of Education's  MSP projects, as well as the public at large;
.	Create a complete archive and synthesis recording the research and lessons learned through this program;
.	Serve as a cyber-infrastructure model for future NSF programs concerned with sharing research within and across programs. 
.

At itÆs outset MSPnet had 351 members. Today it has over 9,500 members who are all affiliated with an NSF or ED MSP funded program. In addition it has reached over 1.8 million unique visitors who have accessed over 8.5 million page views.

NSFÆs MSP program was created to engage STEM faculty in higher education institutions to create partnerships with K-12 districts in order to improve challenging courses and curricula, increase the quality, diversity, and quantity of STEM teachers and to provide evidenced based designs to improve student achievement. These partnerships were often large and complex, and presented challenges of stretching beyond institutional boundaries and the need to bridge the differing cultures of K-12 and higher education.

MSPnet was intended to help partnerships create and maintain online communities of practice that involved researchers, STEM faculty, and K-12 practitioners. To that end MSPnet created a platform, which provided each project with an interactive site for its members. Each site included a way for administrators to track and email members of the project, share resources and research, use a file manager to track and share documents, have threaded online discussions, host webinars (free of charge), use an online registration tool for workshops and track events in a shared interactive calendar. To date MSPnet has created 181 such interactive spaces, one for each funded MSP and also one for State Coordinators and Project Directors of the US Department of Education MSP program.

In addition to members being able to share resources, and resources with others within their project, they are also able to share papers, press-clippings, highlights, research, webinars, etc. with other MSP projects and with the public at large. This is accomplished as projects share their  resources with the MSPnet Hub. (See Figure 1). 

Hence, the MSPnet platform is one of nested communities of practice, where resources can be restricted to smaller communities, shared with all MSP projects, or with the public at large.

The MSPnet Hub hosts events for all projects including poster showcases, video presentations of leaders in the field, and site-wide discussions. In addition it hosts the MSPnet Academy, which is a series of webinars led by experts from within and beyond the MSP community. These webinars are archived and are available to the public. See: http://hub.mspnet.org/index.cfm/mspnet_academy

The MSPnet Hub has become a very rich resource  - not only for the MSP program but also for all researchers and practitioners interested in educational reform. Its Library houses an extensive collection of over 1, 950 articles, almost all presented with full text. These articles are relevant to educational change and policy, professional development, and STEM teaching and learning. The Showcase has over 200 press releases, over 330 MSP project reports, over 160 project presentations and 36 videos submitted by the MSPs. See: http://hub.mspnet.org/index.cfm/showcase

MSPnet has also served as an effective archive for the MSP program through its extensive collection of MSP authored papers and documentation of all face-to-face MSP Learning Network Conferences. There are over 500 papers in the Library that are authored by members of the MSP community and share the lessons learned from their work. See: http://hub.mspnet.org/index.cfm/library/list/keyword_id-10679    It has also provided full proceedings, and a video archive of plenary speakers for each MSP conference that has taken place. These can be seen at: http://hub.mspnet.org/index.cfm/pi_conf

 MSPnet has also served as an effective dissemination vehicle. Each week it sends a newsletter to over 9,500 members and 3,000 guest subscribers. These newsletters highlight news and announcements from NSF, emerging research in the field, and MSP project news an...",,"['Bernstein, D. and Falk, J~The Math Science Partnership Network~APS Forum on Education~Summer~2012~12~~~0~ ~0~ ~28/11/2017 04:01:51.763000000', 'Bernstein, D; Falk, J~MSPnet: The Math Science Partnership Network~APS Forum on Education~Summer~2012~12~~~0~ ~0~ ~28/11/2017 04:01:51.763000000']",03/01/2007,MSPnet: Phase II,Grant
536,"The Chemistry Department at Louisiana State University & Agricultural and Mechanical College will acquire a high resolution time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometer with this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi User program (CRIF:MU).  The requested instrument will be used in a diverse range of research projects including the investigation of conjugated systems displaying tunable energy transfer; synthesis and study of novel sensing agents; synthetic tailoring of end groups in conducting poly(alkylheteroarene)s; characterization of inorganic-organic supramolecules; synthesis and characterization of fluorescent porphyrinoid bioconjugates; and new synthetic methods using oxime ethers. 

Mass spectroscopy is a tool widely employed by physical and biological scientists to identify and characterize materials and chemical species by accurate measurement of their mass as they are vaporized and fragmented in the instrument.  Undergraduates would be exposed to this instrumentation via classroom connections and laboratories, as well as undergraduate research programs and summer programs.  PhD students will benefit from formalized, hands-on training.  Additionally, another main goal of this project is to create a regional mass spectrometry resource with enhanced availability to external users by inclusion of easy access, high security cyber infrastructure that will be built into the facility to provide remote access to off site users from regional institutions.",NSF,4900,LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM,202 Himes Hall,Baton Rouge,US,Baton Rouge,LA06,Louisiana State University & Agricultural and Mechanical College,LA,708032701,47.049,"['Kermit K Murray', 'Robert P Hammer']",01/26/2007,075050765,430149,01/31/2010,4900,CHEMICAL INSTRUMENTATION,430149,0639242,940050792,Andrew W Maverick,202 Himes Hall,Baton Rouge,US,Baton Rouge,LA06,Louisiana State University & Agricultural and Mechanical College,LA,708032701,maverick@lsu.edu,Andrew,Maverick,W,2255783465,cmurillo@nsf.gov,Carlos A.

537,"This CI-TEAM project will demonstrate how to empower local governments, policymakers, students and K-12 teachers to take advantage of cyberinfrastructure (CI) in the environmental arena. Specifically, the project will develop educational modules on CI for environmental monitoring and modeling and combine them into four mini-courses targeted at personnel in local governments, policy-makers, students in environmental science, geography, biology, engineering, public administration, social science and highschool teachers. The work builds upon and goes beyond the ECOPLEX (Environmental Conditions Online for the DFW MetroPLEX) program created by the University of North Texas and the City of Denton that has been running for six years. The innovative research and development to support the education modules include: a wireless sensor network to monitor soil moisture over a watershed; a low-cost total column ozone automated monitor; and a web portal that supports sophisticated analysis and modeling tools. The educational modules will focus on: wireless sensor use and deployment, databases and documentation, data analysis and modeling, and environmental decision policymaking. The modules will eventually be merged and modified, into one three-credit hour course, which would be offered as elective credit possibly with a hybrid of on-line and on-site instruction mode to educate graduate students in several fields as well as allow current high school teachers and local government personnel the opportunity to participate in the course for continuing education credit while they are in the work force. 

This project targets a very broad stakeholder audience responsible for environmental observation, education and decision making across multiple levels of public entities, particularly in local governments, high schools and universities, thus will have very broader impacts. It prepares the next generation of scientists and engineers and also the citizenry to be able to interpret data in order to make informed environmental decisions. This improved information awareness of such considerable cross-section of society will have profound and broad effects on the quality of individual choices and public policy. An intensive outreach program directed at the general public of all ages with emphasis on traditionally underrepresented groups will also be implemented based on: a field-based lesson at the Lewisville Lake Environmental Learning Area (LLELA), a week-long Watershed Summer Day Camp and a Watershed Family Fun Science Saturday offered at the Elm Fork Education Center (EFEC). Upon completion of this project, these programs will be offered at LLELA and EFEC every school year.

PI: Brendan Mumey

This research project considers agile constraint-based routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) strategies to mitigate physical layer impairments that affect the end-to-end performance of next generation all-optical networks.  The RWA methods being developed take into account changing traffic patterns, resource availability, and the behavior of the underlying physical layer under transient conditions to minimize impairments and assure that Quality of Service (QoS) requirements are achieved.  Physical layer network impairments that affect end-to-end path performance include switching transients, amplifier gain fluctuations, and channel cross talk.  Temporal and geographic variations in network traffic can also affect network performance.  A general framework for studying the cumulative effects of such impairments and traffic variations is being designed and conducted using the Montana State University optical network testbed.  This work requires a combination of modeling, simulation and validation steps.  Based on this new framework, state-of-the-art physically aware RWA algorithms are being designed, implemented and tested.

Broader Impact:

The outcomes of this research will become an important component for future cyber infrastructure by exploring methods to manage the underlying network that are consistent with the new application-driven network demands. This project will integrate teaching and research activities in electrical and computer engineering with computer science, bringing together faculty and students from both disciplines to address system-level design issues spanning both disciplines. The project team will engage undergraduate students in the research through interdisciplinary senior design courses and individual research projects.

541,"This grant provides funding for the development of novel optimization tools to be used for data mining. The work will focus on the incorporation of inputs from disparate sources with different levels of reliability.  These inputs will be allowed affect the patterns to a degree that depends on the confidence level attributed to the inputs.  The optimization and algorithms developed will also rely on pairwise comparisons, or separation measures, rather than on parametric mapping of the attributes alone.  The data mining outcome, in the form of classification, will be an optimal solution to a penalty minimization objective.  The penalty is assigned to be higher for deviating from opinions and pairwise comparisons that are more reliable and it will be smaller penalty for opinions and pairwise comparisons for less reliable sources. This family of techniques will be tested for effectiveness against existing methodologies in areas of patient prognosis; customer segmentation; and country or firm credit assessment. The testing will result in calibration and fine tuning of the penalty functions appropriate for use in different contexts.

If successful, the data mining techniques are expected to have impact on pattern recognition and on methodologies for capturing expert knowledge.

542,"The Electrical and Communications Systems (ECS) Division Grantees Workshop to Enhance Diversity is an interdisciplinary initiative focus on the discipline of electrical engineering aimed at promoting knowledge of major technological challenges in devices and systems. Today's universe of technologies bridge computational networks, control devices at the nano, micro and macro scales. As such, it is imperative that ECS take a leadership role in providing mentoring opportunities for diverse groups that could be overlooked due to a variety of resource challenges.

The convergence of micro-, nano-, cogno-, bio-electronic, controls, networks and computation along with communication needs drives our research community to assure a national discussion on these topics. This NSF ECS Grantees' Workshop provides a forum for open discussion with authoritative researchers to dialogue with current and future researchers in these subjects.

It is the objective of this proposal to request support for the travel expenses for PIs and co-PIs, for students, and for some of the direct conference costs including CD production of the proceedings, communication and supplies. Our audience includes seasoned mentors and PIs from minority and underrepresented institutions from around the Nation. The PI and co-PI will work with NSF ECS to ensure success of the workshop given their experience and knowledge of electrical systems and the ECS initiative.

Intellectual Merit: The ECS directorate aim is at research and system integration of complex systems in the areas of device technologies, computation networking, wireless, cyber infrastructure, and control and systems principles at the nano, micro and macro scales. The ECS Grantees Workshop purpose is to mentor and outreach to the awarded PIs. This will be accomplished through the review of current research, and strategies to leverage the technologies to industry and educational programs. This workshop facilitates the interaction between researchers who are doing innovative research who would otherwise not meet each other. The designated speakers for this workshop will be motivational and insightful thus providing mentoring to the PIs and helping to provide direction for future research.

Broader Impact: The interaction of the ECS workshop will provide a significant technical exchange with researchers. This workshop will foster collaboration between researchers from different areas thus realizing new unique research and educational partnerships. This Grantees workshop will allow the program directors to interact with researchers to promote and evaluate the ECS vision of technical challenges in the integration of complex systems, and devices for communications, networks, electronics, and controls.

The ECS Initiative provides an opportunity for Grantees as well as their colleagues to interchange with experts in their respective fields. Students will be able to interact and present their current work that is occurring under various mentor tutelage. The workshop provides an opportunity for ECS Program Directors to interact with students, academia and industry participants to promote/evaluate the ECS vision of the technical challenges in complex systems, economics, environmental, control and educational impacts.",NSF,4900,TUSKEGEE UNIVERSITY,1200 W Montgomery Road,Tuskegee Institute,US,Tuskegee Institute,AL03,Tuskegee University,AL,360881923,47.041,['Gregory V Murphy'],05/12/2006,128214178,,04/30/2007,4900,"ELECT, PHOTONICS, & MAG DEVICE",201074,0629358,128214178,Legand L Burge,1200 W Montgomery Road,Tuskegee Institute,US,Tuskegee Institute,AL03,Tuskegee University,AL,360881923,legandlburgejr@gmail.com,Legand,Burge,L,3342209640,@nsf.gov,,,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,,05/15/2006,"ECS Grantees Workshop to Enhance Diversity being held June 13-15, 2006",Grant

This award funds the First US-China Workshops on Neutron Scattering Science and Technology to promote the confluence of expertise and ideas from universities and government laboratories of both countries to accelerate basic research and development in Spallation Neutron Source (SNS).  The U.S. organizers are Sow-Hsin Chen (PI) Professor of Applied Radiation Physics in the Department of Nuclear Engineering at MIT and Chun-Keung Loong (Co-PI), Senior Physicist, Intense Pulsed Neutron Source Division, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL).  The Chinese organizer is Zhixiang Zhao, President of the China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE).  The first workshop will be held November 2006 in Beijing, China, and is intended to bring together 60 (25 from U.S.) scientific leaders, neutron scientists and engineers from universities and neutron centers together with their Chinese counterparts.  The second workshop will be held in the U.S. in fall 2007 and will involve a broader base of U.S. participants, specifically 5 early-career scientists and engineers and 25 graduate students from the U.S. 

Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) is an important interdisciplinary method for illuminating neutrons to characterize the properties of materials.  Neutrons from a beam ""scatter"" from a target material in a way that reveals its structure and properties.  SNS is of interest to multiple research communities in both countries.  SNS impacts physics, materials science, chemistry, biology and engineering, but also has broader implications for research areas such as nuclear medicine.  The workshops will have broader societal impact, due to the anticipated expanding role of neutron scattering in solving critical, global problems in energy, environment, and health via materials characterization and utilization. The workshops will allow the U.S. neutron community to understand China s thrust in R&D for basic science and nuclear technology; the emphasis on Cyber infrastructure will encourage collaborative exchange in scientific and technological research.  The proposed workshops are likely to increase the talent pool and better prepare the next generation of scientists to the benefit of both countries.",NSF,4900,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,77 MASSACHUSETTS AVE,Cambridge,US,Cambridge,MA07,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,MA,021394301,47.079,['Chun-Keung  Loong'],04/26/2006,001425594,,05/31/2010,4900,Catalyzing New Intl Collab,70000,0623834,001425594,Sow-Hsin  Chen,77 MASSACHUSETTS AVE,Cambridge,US,Cambridge,MA07,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,MA,021394301,sowhsin@mit.edu,Sow-Hsin,Chen,,6172533810,wychang@nsf.gov,W.

544,"This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by Prof. Craig L. Hill at Emory University  to elucidate the structural, electronic and other physical properties of a newly discovered class of terminal metaloxo complexes of the coinage- and noble-metal elements (primarily gold and silver) and to investigate the ability of these complexes to activate dioxygen and catalyze air-based oxidations.  A second goal is to prepare robust chiral microporous solids formed by self assembly of enantiopure polyoxometalates with linking cations and to investigate asymmetric oxidations of alkenes and other organic substrates catalyzed by these materials.  A third aim is to develop methods to link large multi-metal polyoxometalates into giant crystalline nanostructures and to investigate the recently documented ability of these giant clusters and structures to catalyze green oxidations with air as the oxidant and water as the solvent.  

The systems under study should further the development of green chemistry catalytic systems for selective, atomeconomic, air-based organic oxidations compatible with water.

In February 2002, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) revised its Part 15 emission rules and allowed the use of a large section of the radio-frequency (RF) spectrum by commercial ultra-wideband (UWB) transmission devices. The restrictions imposed on these devices include a limit on the transmitted power spectral density of -41 dBm/MHz from 3.1 to 10.6 GHz and a minimum signal bandwidth of 500 MHz. The availability of such a wide bandwidth has enabled several new short-distance, low-power, high bit-rate applications for communication, ranging and location-finding. Industrial standards proposals for the use of the above bandwidth allow for very impressive throughput performance. However, since time-to-market is a major constraint, many of these standards use variants of well-known carrier-based communication methods.

This new FCC policy allows the public use of such a large spectrum for the first time. Thus it opens opportunities for fundamentally new research in wireless communications in topics such as radically new signaling methods and architectures, and their integrated circuit realization, in contrast with the traditional narrow-band approach of carrier-based modulation techniques.

Intellectual Merits: The PI proposes to use this unique opportunity to research highly efficient, integrated circuit implementations of transceivers for UWB radio applications. He will explore the trade-offs between the signaling and system level, and the architectural and integrated circuit implementation level.  He proposes to investigate an implementation-friendly digital multi-carrier UWB signaling format that is expected to alleviate major issues with UWB communications, namely interference and multipath. He also plans to investigate a low-power interference detector which detects the presence of undesired signals in given frequency bands. The detector shares interference information with other transceivers and allows for a unique intelligent interference mitigation strategy. The interference detection strategy can be combined very well with the proposed signaling format, with minimal hardware cost or power overhead.  These innovations are enabled by our proposed research efforts in the efficient implementation of transceivers in VLSI integrated circuits. The low RF output power-levels in UWB open the possibility to use current and future nanometer CMOS technologies and exploit the impressive operation speed they offer. He plans to develop a circuit implementation of the transceivers including such circuit blocks as broadband amplifiers, high linearity correlators and matched filters, high-speed D/A and A/D converters, and output buffers.

Broader Impacts: Communication technologies and more specifically wireless communication
technologies play a prominent role in developing a broadly accessible cyber-infrastructure. UWB radio technology opens exciting new opportunities for applications and the proposed research on the realization of an efficient physical layer is crucial enabler towards applications.

The shortage of analog, mixed-signal, and RF integrated circuit designers, with in-depth knowledge of the communication systems aspects of the problem, has been a continuous challenge for the advancement of this field. Through research experiences and courses, his program will educate researchers and circuit designers with the cross-disciplinary skills to invent new design principles for integrated circuits in the context of the system in which they operate.

The program involves the collaboration of PIs at different institutions. It leverages the industrial expertise and research backgrounds of both PIs. It further offers unique opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to interact with a broader research effort. To enhance the educational opportunities for students in this emerging field, new courses will be developed.

Even though polymeric glasses are impressive engineering materials, there are considerable opportunities to improve their strength and failure properties.  Recent evidence indicates that reinforcement of polymer glasses with nanoscale particles  (i.e. nanocomposites) can produce materials with strength and failure properties that are substantially improved and, given current understanding, cannot be produced in any other manner.    The systematic development of new glassy nanocomposites will require an intricate understanding of deformation processes on the nanoscale.   We propose an integrated effort that utilizes experiments, simulations, and theory to develop the needed understanding.  Experiments will be used to characterize both the macroscopic and microscopic deformation behavior of model PMMA/silica nanocomposites. Deformation-induced polymer mobility will be quantified for the first time in these materials.  Experimental results will be compared with continuum, mesoscale, and microscopic theoretical approaches.    Computer simulations will guide and check the theoretical developments.  Key questions to be addressed include:  
What is the interaction between the intrinsic nanoscale heterogeneity  of  a polymer  glass and the  presence of a nanoparticle?  For what size nanoparticles do continuum models of the polymer glass fail to describe the experimental behavior?  What is the microscopic origin of deformation-induced mobility?  What are the dynamics inside a fibril created by crazing? What is the relationship between mechanical and dynamic heterogeneity in polymer glasses?    The computational demands of the proposed work are substantial and we will take full advantage of the emerging national cyber infrastructure, including the  NSF supported Grid Laboratory of Wisconsin (GLOW). 
 
We anticipate that this work will have broad impact in at least two dimensions.    New polymer glass nanocomposites are urgently needed to solve vexing manufacturing problems such as the weakness of nanoscale photoresist features created by advanced lithography.    Our primary technical goal is to develop tools that, using a minimum of experimental input, can predict the deformation properties of glassy nanocomposites as a function of temperature, thermal history, strain rate, and deformation geometry.  Additionally, the PIs will work with a University of Wisconsin-Madison program known as PEOPLE  (Pre-college Enrichment Opportunity Program for Learning Excellence) to increase the likelihood that minority and low-income high school students matriculate to colleges and universities.  The PIs and our coworkers will provide experiences that will help these students to become scientifically literate citizens and encourage them to consider careers in science and engineering; we will work with teachers of these students in our laboratories and in the development of instructional materials.   The PEOPLE program has a proven track record of sending  more than 90% of its participants to college.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SYSTEM,21 North Park Street,MADISON,US,Madison,WI02,University of Wisconsin-Madison,WI,537151218,47.041,"['James M Caruthers', 'Juan J De Pablo', 'KENNETH S SCHWEIZER']",08/16/2005,161202122,1319000,08/31/2009,4900,INTERFAC PROCESSES & THERMODYN,1319000,0506840,041188822,Mark D Ediger,21 North Park Street,MADISON,US,Madison,WI02,University of Wisconsin-Madison,WI,537151218,ediger@chem.wisc.edu,Mark,Ediger,D,6082627273,@nsf.gov,,,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,"['Chen, K; Schweizer, KS~Suppressed Segmental Relaxation as the Origin of Strain Hardening in Polymer Glasses~PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS~102~2009~ ~http://wok-ws.isiknowledge.com/WoS?recid=176072572#000262723700074~10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.03830~0~ ~0~ ~28/07/2018 04:17:48.793000000', 'Chen, K; Schweizer, KS; Stamm, R; Lee, E; Caruthers, JM~Theory of nonlinear creep in polymer glasses~JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS~129~2008~ ~http://wok-ws.isiknowledge.com/WoS?recid=174726217#000260944300051~10.1063/1.300805~0~ ~0~ ~28/07/2018 04:17:48.793000000', 'Riggleman, RA; Toepperwein, G; Papakonstantopoulos, GJ; Barrat, JL; de Pablo, JJ~Entanglement network in nanoparticle reinforced polymers~JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS~130~2009~ ~http://wok-ws.isiknowledge.com/WoS?recid=181995433#000267600400043~10.1063/1.314802~0~ ~0~ ~28/07/2018 04:17:48.793000000', 'Papakonstantopoulos, G.J., Riggleman, R.A., Barrat, J.L., de Pablo, J.J.~Molecular Plasticity of Polymeric Glasses in the Elastic Regime~Phys.

549,"Many real-world problems involve optimizing over decisions that take discrete set of values. Examples of such problems include routing vehicles in a logistics network, VLSI circuit design, gene sequencing, portfolio selection, wireless network design and many others. Large-scale instances of such problems are extremely difficult to solve and require both theoretical and computational advancements in solution approaches. This project is aimed at development of theory and computational enhancements for Functional Annealing (FA) algorithm to solve large-scale discrete optimization problems.  FA is a stochastic local search algorithm that performs local improvement while randomly perturbing the objective function in each iteration. The random perturbation allows the algorithm to escape local optima and can also be used to guide the stochastic search in the solution space by creating bias. The algorithm can be used with any local improvement strategy. These features make the algorithm computationally more attractive but significantly harder to analyze theoretically compared to well-known algorithms such as Simulated Annealing. The proposed work involves investigating asymptotic and finite time convergence properties of FA. It also seeks to identify computational enhancements of the algorithm by finding the optimal choice of perturbation, and incorporating learning schemes in the generation of bias in the perturbation. As part of the computational investigation, FA algorithms will be developed for two important problem classes. The first class is the network design problems arising in logistics applications. The PI will work with an industry partner in package shipment industry to develop and test the algorithms on real-world instances of network design problems. The second class is the unconstrained quadratic binary programming problems. This class models a large number of combinatorial optimization problems.

If successful, the proposed work will lead to development of efficient algorithms for very large instances of discrete optimization problems with provable convergence guarantees. Theoretical results from this work would improve the understanding of other stochastic local search methods as well. The work on network design problems could lead to new algorithms and software tools for planning problems in logistics.  The computational testing for unconstrained quadratic binary programming problems could generate a powerful solution tool for many researchers and practitioners, given its broad applicability.

552,"The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a longitudinal study of a representative sample of U.S. individuals and their families.  Beginning in 1968, this is the longest running panel of its kind.  The Child Development Supplement (CDS) of the PSID is an extensive data set on children and their families collected with the goal of understanding socio-demographic, psychological, and economic aspects of childhood.  The overarching objective of this current NSF-funded project is to augment the entire PSID-CDS data archive by making important improvements to the first wave of CDS, collected in 1997.  Most of these improvements will use recent technological advancements in database software, and have already been applied to PSID data and the second wave of CDS data.  Specifically, the project will (a) provide richer documentation for CDS-I that takes advantage of recent technological advances in the creation of electronic codebook databases, allowing CDS-I documentation to be integrated into the user-friendly, cutting-edge PSID-CDS-II web-based data archive; (b) create a cross-year variable index that is integrated with and accessible through the online data center, which will streamline variable identification and selection; (c) create Common Core of Data (CCD) linkages and variables for CDS-I children as developed for CDS-II children, allowing users to study characteristics of schools for the CDS children as of 1997; and (d) provide data describing the content of media programming watched by children in CDS-I. 

The project will contribute broadly to enhancing scientific understanding by making the CDS-I data more usable, accessible, and integrated with the larger PSID and CDS-II databases. The PSID-CDS data are 'intergenerational' in structure with information contained in 33 waves of data from multiple family members, allowing analysts to fully link information on children, their parents, their grandparents, and other relatives.   The completion of the project will give researchers and students from a variety of disciplines access to the data.  Furthermore, the activities of this project will contribute to the emerging e-science cyber infrastructure by providing additional data tools and expertise via the Internet (www.psidonline.isr.umich.edu) to researchers so that access to a highly complex data archive is achieved without regard to geographic location.  This open access will lead to greater long-term economic benefits, better-informed government decision-makers, and accelerated progress in science itself (see Science, March 19, 2004).  Lastly, the data processing, documentation, and dissemination activities are pedagogical tools that can be used to teach research concepts to a diverse audience.

553,"This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build upon the successful development of the Phase I project that developed models and algorithms for planning and job scheduling systems. The software tool described in this proposal will allow organizations to schedule their operations in real-time to generate the optimal plan to maximizing their operational targets. During Phase I, the team created new planning and scheduling algorithms and successful empirical studies using recent innovative research in the areas of large-scale optimization and the newly developed methodology of Nested Partitions. In Phase II the team plan to further develop the concept to create successful implementations in several manufacturing firms. The technology to be developed in Phase II will greatly enhance the capability of the current planning and scheduling software tools. This innovation brings the state-of-the-art decision and optimization methodology to the Advanced Planning and Scheduling software market. In addition, planning systems developed with the proposed methodology will add new levels of flexibility for companies to more quickly adapt to changing material, operational, and market conditions. 

This SBIR project will make new planning and scheduling tools broadly accessible to virtually any manufacturing firm. The proposed scheduling and planning tools will enable them to communicate, collaborate, and integrate their planning and scheduling functionalities to obtain optimal results throughout their enterprise and their entire supply chain. It is expected that coordinated use of these tools will eventually create an integrated cyber-infrastructure for American manufacturing firms and create more efficient supply chains that will enable these firms to be more competitive in the global marketplace. Moreover, if successful, the development of this proposed tool will lead to fruitful attempts to develop and commercialize an advanced planning and scheduling software tools that can be used for many other sectors of the economy.",NSF,4900,L S OPTIMAL,1445 STARR GRASS DR.,MADISON,US,Madison,WI02,"LS OPTIMAL, INC.",WI,537194538,47.041,,03/25/2005,130038250,,03/31/2008,4900,SMALL BUSINESS PHASE II,644965,0450552,,Guining  Li,1445 STARR GRASS DR.,MADISON,US,Madison,WI02,"LS OPTIMAL, INC.",WI,537194538,guining@yahoo.com,Guining,Li,,6088331189,@nsf.gov,,,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,,04/01/2005,SBIR Phase II:      Advanced Planning and Scheduling Tools for Extended Enterprise Systems,Grant

This research consists of a large, new, digital sky survey, using the 48-inch telescope at Palomar Observatory, and a new, 112-CCD camera constructed for this purpose. The Palomar-QUEST (PQ) survey is a collaboration between Caltech and Yale primarily, with several other groups involved in various aspects.  The ultimate goal is to cover about 15,000 square degrees, reaching to a depth twice that of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey by coadding, but the key distinguishing characteristic of this survey is its synoptic nature, covering the same regions of the sky repeatedly, on time scales ranging from days to years.  This survey enables a broad range of science, much of it to be accomplished not by the current investigators but by the rest of the community, once the data are fully available.  Specific projects include a large quasar survey, including searches for very high redshift and gravitationally lensed quasars, a search for supernovae, and a study of gamma ray burst afterglows.  The survey will draw on the latest advances in information technology, and will be developed in close collaboration with the emerging National Virtual Observatory, so as to assure effective use and dissemination of the massive data sets expected, and their thorough scientific exploitation.  The problems of data intensive science are common to many fields of science, industry, and society, so any solutions are expected to be broadly applicable, and to add to the national cyber-infrastructure.",NSF,4900,YALE UNIVERSITY,Office of Sponsored Projects,New Haven,US,New Haven,CT03,Yale University,CT,065208327,47.049,,08/06/2004,043207562,868404,09/30/2010,4900,EXTRAGALACTIC ASTRON & COSMOLO,868404,0407297,043207562,Charles  Baltay,Office of Sponsored Projects,New Haven,US,New Haven,CT03,Yale University,CT,065208327,charles.baltay@yale.edu,Charles,Baltay,,2034323386,nsharp@nsf.gov,Nigel Sharp,7032924905,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,"['Drake, Andrew J.; Djorgovski, S.

This research consists of a large, new, digital sky survey, using the 48-inch telescope at Palomar Observatory, and a new, 112-CCD camera constructed for this purpose. The Palomar-QUEST (PQ) survey is a collaboration between Caltech and Yale primarily, with several other groups involved in various aspects.  The ultimate goal is to cover about 15,000 square degrees, reaching to a depth twice that of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey by coadding, but the key distinguishing characteristic of this survey is its synoptic nature, covering the same regions of the sky repeatedly, on time scales ranging from days to years.  This survey enables a broad range of science, much of it to be accomplished not by the current investigators but by the rest of the community, once the data are fully available.  Specific projects include a large quasar survey, including searches for very high redshift and gravitationally lensed quasars, a search for supernovae, and a study of gamma ray burst afterglows.  The survey will draw on the latest advances in information technology, and will be developed in close collaboration with the emerging National Virtual Observatory, so as to assure effective use and dissemination of the massive data sets expected, and their thorough scientific exploitation.  The problems of data intensive science are common to many fields of science, industry, and society, so any solutions are expected to be broadly applicable, and to add to the national cyber-infrastructure.",NSF,4900,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,1200 E California Blvd,PASADENA,US,Pasadena,CA27,California Institute of Technology,CA,911250600,47.049,,08/06/2004,009584210,1840272,09/30/2010,4900,EXTRAGALACTIC ASTRON & COSMOLO,1840272,0407448,009584210,Stanislav G Djorgovski,1200 E California Blvd,PASADENA,US,Pasadena,CA27,California Institute of Technology,CA,911250600,george@astro.caltech.edu,Stanislav,Djorgovski,G,6263954415,nsharp@nsf.gov,Nigel Sharp,7032924905,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,,10/01/2004,Collaborative Research:  The Palomar-QUEST Survey,Grant

In February 2002, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) revised its Part 15 emission rules and allowed the use of a large section of the radio-frequency (RF) spectrum by commercial ultra-wideband (UWB) transmission devices. The restrictions imposed on these devices include a limit on the transmitted power spectral density of -41 dBm/MHz from 3.1 to 10.6 GHz and a minimum signal bandwidth of 500 MHz. The availability of such a wide bandwidth has enabled several new short-distance, low-power, high bit-rate applications for communication, ranging and location-finding. Industrial standards proposals for the use of the above bandwidth allow for very impressive throughput performance. However, since time-to-market is a major constraint, many of these standards use variants of well-known carrier-based communication methods.

This new FCC policy allows the public use of such a large spectrum for the first time. Thus it opens opportunities for fundamentally new research in wireless communications in topics such as radically new signaling methods and architectures, and their integrated circuit realization, in contrast with the traditional narrow-band approach of carrier-based modulation techniques.

Intellectual Merits: The PI proposes to use this unique opportunity to research highly efficient, integrated circuit implementations of transceivers for UWB radio applications. He will explore the trade-offs between the signaling and system level, and the architectural and integrated circuit implementation level.  He proposes to investigate an implementation-friendly digital multi-carrier UWB signaling format that is expected to alleviate major issues with UWB communications, namely interference and multipath. He also plans to investigate a low-power interference detector which detects the presence of undesired signals in given frequency bands. The detector shares interference information with other transceivers and allows for a unique intelligent interference mitigation strategy. The interference detection strategy can be combined very well with the proposed signaling format, with minimal hardware cost or power overhead.  These innovations are enabled by our proposed research efforts in the efficient implementation of transceivers in VLSI integrated circuits. The low RF output power-levels in UWB open the possibility to use current and future nanometer CMOS technologies and exploit the impressive operation speed they offer. He plans to develop a circuit implementation of the transceivers including such circuit blocks as broadband amplifiers, high linearity correlators and matched filters, high-speed D/A and A/D converters, and output buffers.

Broader Impacts: Communication technologies and more specifically wireless communication
technologies play a prominent role in developing a broadly accessible cyber-infrastructure. UWB radio technology opens exciting new opportunities for applications and the proposed research on the realization of an efficient physical layer is crucial enabler towards applications.

The shortage of analog, mixed-signal, and RF integrated circuit designers, with in-depth knowledge of the communication systems aspects of the problem, has been a continuous challenge for the advancement of this field. Through research experiences and courses, his program will educate researchers and circuit designers with the cross-disciplinary skills to invent new design principles for integrated circuits in the context of the system in which they operate.

The program involves the collaboration of PIs at different institutions. It leverages the industrial expertise and research backgrounds of both PIs. It further offers unique opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to interact with a broader research effort. To enhance the educational opportunities for students in this emerging field, new courses will be developed.

559,"This grant requests funds to support the inaugural International Conference on Continuous Optimization, to be held on the campus of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute from Monday August 2, 2004 through Wednesday August 4, 2004.  The Conference will be preceded by a two-day Summer School, in which several distinguished scholars will offer tutorials on contemporary topics in continuous optimization.  The School will be attended by advanced graduate students and postdoctoral fellows on the recommendation of their supervisors.  The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is that it will provide a stimulus for sustained research in continuous optimization, which is a fertile scientific/engineering discipline with immense practical applications.  Among its broader impacts, the proposed activity will have a significant affect on cyber infrastructure.
 
Continuous optimization has played, and continues to play, a major role in advancing and impacting the contemporary developments of many scientific and engineering disciplines, and provides a fundamental set of mathematical and computational tools that are key for many real-world decision support systems and modeling applications, which in turn are vital for the sustained growth of the economy and for the well being of society.  The goal of the Conference is threefold: (a) to provide a focused forum for US and international researchers and practitioners to meet in order to facilitate the rapid exchange of state-of-the-art results and promising ideas to ensure the healthy advancement of continuous optimization, (b) to offer educational opportunities to graduate students and junior researchers to learn about the latest developments in continuous optimization, and (c) to encourage women and minority researchers to work in this important area of Operations Research and Computational Science.  The Conference will facilitate the discussion and dissimilation of the latest results in continuous optimization, will inspire new ideas and sharpen existing ones, will advance scientific knowledge and increase the general population's awareness of optimization, and will attract new talents to work in the discipline.

560,"This project seeks to create advanced hardware and software technologies for supporting dynamically extensible networks. Extensible Network Services Platforms (NSP) support the dynamic insertion of hardware and software plugins that serve as network-resident assists to distributed applications. To enable the greatest impact, extensible networks require sophisticated control mechanisms to enable application developers to specify how application sessions may be configured, while allowing the network the flexibility to map individual sessions onto available resources and to accommodate individual user preferences. This project will develop and demonstrate scalable, high performance NSPs and will create a software Network Extension System (NES) to automatically configure application sessions on demand. In addition to becoming more flexible, networks must become more robust, in order to support advanced mission-critical applications. It is no longer reasonable to assume that network routers operate in a benign environment where users cooperate for the larger social good. The growing challenges to the nation's cyber-infrastructure make it necessary to design systems that can operate reliably and deliver excellent performance, even in the presence of extreme traffic conditions.

562,"Distributed applications comprising components from multiple
administrative domains, pose scalability and availability challenges
because of the lack of a central administrative authority.  This
project investigates, in the context of the Web Services architecture,
whether application-level intelligence on the network path between
clients and services can help address these challenges. The
intelligence is embodied in modules for inspecting client traffic,
making decisions about service actions such as replication, request
redirection, or admission control, and finally realizing these
actions.  The project combines a system architecture for executing
service-specific actions at intermediate routing nodes with
application-neutral algorithms for servicing client requests closer to
the network edge.  Both the architecture and the algorithms work with
a semantic framework, which treats service requests as structured
accesses against a (physical or virtual) database.

The intellectual merits of the activity include (1) development of
novel techniques and algorithms for automatically scaling
component-based services in response to adverse client and network
load conditions; and (2) investigation of architectures for securely
and efficiently realizing service-specific actions on client requests
closer to the network edge.

Broader impacts of the activity include (1) techniques for improving
the resilience of the nation's cyber-infrastructure against malicious
attacks; and (2) integration of the research results into an

563,"Logical frameworks are languages for specifying logics and reasoning with them formally, with machine support.  Examples are logics to prove the safety of programs or authenticate access rights to protected data. The project investigates theoretical foundations and efficient implementation techniques for logical frameworks.  Specifically, the project addresses performance bottlenecks in current, large-scale applications of the Twelf logical framework aimed at improving safety and security of mobile code within the national cyber infrastructure. The techniques include methods for proof compression based on intrinsic redundancy, and methods to increase the degree of automation in proof search and verification.

Logic is a key discipline in computer science because it allows us to make definitive judgments such as ""yes, this program is safe to run"" or ""yes, this agent is allowed to access these data"".  The critical notion is that of a formal proof, which can convince a code recipient of its safety or an operating system of access rights.  Logical frameworks represent such proofs as data structures.
