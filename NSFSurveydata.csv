0,"Much research in the social sciences and development of government policy relies on survey data, and the demand for survey data continues to grow.  The need for more data has led to longer surveys, increasing the burden for survey respondents in terms of time and effort.  Empirical evidence shows a positive correlation between survey length and survey nonresponse, which threatens the representativeness of the survey estimates.  There also is evidence that measurement (reporting) error increases as respondents are asked to answer more questions in the survey.  Collecting fewer variables may not satisfy a given study's objectives, however.  This research project experimentally evaluates the ability to collect all desired data through a split questionnaire design in which respondents are asked only a subset of the questions.  The project will use a multiple imputation method to complete the data in the sections that are not asked of particular respondents.  The investigators' will extend current imputation methods to include semi-parametric and parametric models.  The main hypothesis is that the split questionnaire design approach will yield estimates with less bias and even less total error compared to deploying the full questionnaire.

This project evaluates a method that essentially transfers part of the time and effort to complete the survey from the individual to the researcher.  It also evaluates the ability to collect higher quality data as a result of this reduction in respondent burden.  Finally, the study aims to extend the employed statistical methods to better preserve the properties of the data.  The results will help to provide an alternative methodology for a wide array of surveys, improve split questionnaire design methodology itself, and provide information regarding the circumstances under which implementing such designs can be beneficial.",NSF,4900,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,3040 Cornwallis Road,Research Triangle Park,US,Durham,NC04,Research Triangle Institute,NC,277092194,47.075,,09/17/2013,004868105,580000,05/31/2018,4900,"METHOD, MEASURE & STATS",580000,1259985,004868105,Emilia  Peytcheva,3040 Cornwallis Road,Research Triangle Park,US,Durham,NC04,Research Triangle Institute,NC,277092194,epeytcheva@rti.org,Emilia,Peytcheva,,9195417217,ceavey@nsf.gov,Cheryl L.

The need for data is great, but the quality of the collected data can be reduced when surveys become very long.

This study uses an experimental design to study the effect of shortening the survey on any reduction in nonresponse (nonparticipation) and reduction in measurement error (error in the responses).  It also evaluates a way to reproduce the full data while giving only a subset of the survey questions to each selected individual, so the overall burden on respondents is smaller in comparison to completing the full questionnaire.  The answers to the omitted questions are imputed multiple times in order to provide a complete dataset and the ability to reflect the uncertainty from obtaining these responses from a statistical model - a method reffered to in the literature as split questionnaire design, or matrix sampling.

We fielded the experiment with four conditions, varying the length of the survey and the location of the survey questions. The survey instrument included questions from major national surveys.  A substantial challenge was getting sufficient participation using a low-cost design that invited sample members by mail to complete a web survey.  The data collection was paused and the data collection design was modified in order to better address the issue of low participation, approximately doubling the response rate for the latter sample releases.  The results of these changes are being described in a separate manuscript.

Our preliminary research showed that measurement error can be reduced when the survey is shorter, but we have not yet fully evaluated the impact on nonresponse and nonresponse bias.  Contrary to common expectations about the effect of survey length on nonresponse, response rates were not substantially higher for the survey that was only half the length of the original instrument.  Thus, our experimental and nonexperimental evidence so far suggests that shortening the survey can have a beneficial effect on survey estimates, but it is more through improved measurement rather than increased participation.  Our ongoing analyses evaluate the ability to further improve the properties of the survey estimates through the use of multiple imputation in the shorter survey design.  One of the greatest strengths of surveys is the ability to use measures that are designed for a particular purpose and can yield reliable data.  This study provides evidence that shorter surveys and use of split questionnaire design can be one way to improve the collected information.

The Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment

The solution to the problem of dark energy will require a fundamental shift in our understanding of the Universe, and acceptance of any model will require significant corroboration by observations.  The Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) Dark Energy Experiment, HETDEX, offers a technically clean and observationally robust approach to measuring the effects of dark energy.  HETDEX includes an upgrade of the HET for a wider field of view, deployment of the Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS), and completion of a wide field survey which will use 1400 hours of observation to obtain nearly a million redshifts of Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies.  Significant parts of the project are already underway with support from a variety of sources, including substantial private donations.

The survey will determine the local Hubble expansion at redshift 2.4 and measure the angular diameter distance out to that redshift, both to an accuracy of 0.8%, and determine the growth of structure to 2%.  Nearly all other dark energy surveys target lower redshifts, while HETDEX was designed to provide high-redshift information on the evolution of dark energy, as well as being sufficiently powerful to measure dark energy effects even at late times.  HETDEX further will measure the curvature of the Universe to about 0.1%, an order of magnitude better than current projects, and a strong complement to other current and planned studies.  Although HETDEX is optimized for measures of the expansion history, there is significant ancillary science from the survey, such as a collection of spectra of a quarter of a million stars and 1.4 million other galaxies.  Given its capabilities, VIRUS will remain a, if not the, primary instrument for HET for many years.

The significant insights on dark energy, the large database with substantial ancillary science, and the unique and powerful integral field spectrograph on the HET will have a broad impact throughout the astronomical community.  The attraction of the dark energy enigma enables HETDEX to include significant public outreach involving the McDonald Observatory Visitors Center and Stardate radio, including an interactive display for visitors and the involvement of K-12 teachers, as well as a popular webpage at http://www.hetdex.org.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN,"101 E. 27th Street, Suite 5.300",Austin,US,Austin,TX25,University of Texas at Austin,TX,787121532,47.049,"['Gary J Hill', 'Eiichiro  Komatsu', 'Marc D Rafal']",08/25/2010,170230239,3579525,08/31/2015,4900,MID-SCALE INSTRUMENTATION,3579525,0926815,042000273,Karl  Gebhardt,"101 E. 27th Street, Suite 5.300",Austin,US,Austin,TX25,University of Texas at Austin,TX,787121532,gebhardt@astro.as.utexas.edu,Karl,Gebhardt,,5124711473,nsharp@nsf.gov,Nigel Sharp,7032924905,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment, HETDEX, is designed to study the nature of dark energy. HETDEX will provide the most robust and accurate measure of the expansion rate of the Universe as it was 10 billion years ago. By comparing the expansion in the past to the accurate measures known in the nearby Universe, HETDEX will constrain the evolution of dark energy to the highest precision to date. The full project is an upgrade of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, a new instrument VIRUS, software design, data acquisition and analysis. This NSF grant primarily funded the main instrument VIRUS, as well as aspects of the software design. In Oct 2015, HETDEX achieved first light through the telescope, and the telescope upgrade successfuly reached the design specifications. At the end of the grant, the instrument VIRUS has all components, has been tested, and is in final build phase. The expected installation on the telescope is early to mid 2016. As part of the NSF grant, we are working to make all of the data public, and we have designed the web interface for the data. We also maintain a webpage, hetdex.org, that provides updates to both the science and the instrument. Dark energy is one of the greatest mysteries in science, and HETDEX will play a pivotal role in understanding its nature. There are a few observational programs in the world to study dark energy, all with different observational strategies. Once the 4-year survey is completed, HETDEX will provide the strongest measure of dark energy in the early Universe.

2,"This study develops a framework for a tailored random digit dial (RDD) telephone survey design that responds to findings from nonresponse bias studies.  The lack of data for nonrespondents, a major challenge in RDD nonresponse studies, is overcome by using two types of data available regardless of response behavior - paradata and contextual data.  Paradata are data created by the survey process itself and include the history of all calls made to each sampled number (e.g., number of calls placed, calling dates and times) and the survey design features used for each number (e.g., advance letter, monetary incentives, refusal conversion).  Contextual data come from external sources (e.g., decennial census data) and are created by linking the geographic identifier (e.g., census tract, ZIP code) of all sampled telephone numbers to the external data at the corresponding geographic level.  These data include various characteristics of the corresponding location, such as demographics and socio-economics, which are assumed to approximate the characteristics of individuals residing in that location.  The study regards survey response behaviors as a stochastic process influenced simultaneously by the traits of the sample, the survey features, situational circumstances, and the perceived importance of these factors.  Response behavior is modeled with variables in the paradata and contextual data and their interactions.  The fitted model is used to predict how response behaviors change given hypothetical calling schedules and survey design features, allowing design tailoring for any subsequent surveys.  An estimate of a bias indicator can be calculated for respondents and nonrespondents separately.  The magnitude of nonresponse bias can be diagnosed by comparing these estimates.

Survey data are a vital source for quantifiable information about the population and are widely used by government agencies, policy makers, and social, political, and health science researchers.  Advancing the current RDD survey practice is important given the popularity of these surveys in spite of ever-decreasing response rates.  This study will provide a new design framework that takes a holistic approach to nonresponse and incorporates the understandings of nonresponse.  The major element of the design tailoring is that it aims to increase response rates and decrease potential nonresponse bias.  The results of this study will help organizations conducting RDD surveys improve their design process.

3,"Folsom et al. (1999) developed a survey weighted hierarchical Bayes (SWHB) estimation methodology for fitting unit-level generalized linear mixed models and applied it to the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA).  The SWHB solution for the logistic mixed model is robust against model misspecification because the small area estimates (SAEs) for any large sample areas are close to their robust design based analogs.  It also assures that national aggregates of the SAEs are design consistent and, therefore, approximately self-calibrated to the robust design based national estimates.  The use of unit level models also assures internal consistency of SAEs for different levels of aggregation even when different predictors are used at those levels.  However, the Folsom et al. solution assumed that the survey design could be treated as noninformative after inclusion of certain covariates; i.e., the superpopulation model was assumed to hold for the sampled units.  In the interest of robustness against model misspecifications, it is desirable to remove this assumption.  The first goal of this research project is to improve the uncertainty measures of the SWHB solution by taking full account of the survey design effects.  The second project goal is to improve the robustness properties of the enhanced solution by assuring exact calibration of the aggregated SAEs to the design consistent national survey estimate.  To achieve these goals an approximate Gaussian likelihood is assumed for the joint sampling distribution of the input vector of survey weighted fixed and random effect estimating functions.  In this approximate Gaussian likelihood, a design consistent variance-covariance matrix for the vector of estimating functions will be used to fully account for survey design.  The second project goal is achieved by employing a 'calibrated' Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm with a Metropolitan Hastings step that exactly benchmarks the SAEs to the robust design based national estimates.  Simulated data with fixed and random predictors that are not included in the analysis model will be used to compare the robustness of the calibrated and uncalibrated solutions against model misspecification.  Also, the improved SWHB solution will be contrasted with other solutions on one or more large survey data sets, e.g., NHSDA, NHIS, BRFSS.

In spite of the wealth of information that is available at the national level, Federal, State and local agencies concerned with program planning face difficulties because of the lack of specific information at the local level.  Typically, information is desired for States and for substate planning regions or counties.  In principle, surveys that provide national statistics could be expanded so that the needed State and sub-state data were collected; however, government agencies seldom have the economic and infrastructure resources needed to collect this volume of data via a direct survey approach.  Fortunately, new advances in statistics and increases in computing power offer a viable, affordable alternative to the prohibitively expensive direct survey approach and now permit the production of valid and reliable estimates for small areas.  The goal of this project is to promote wider acceptance of model based SAEs for official statistics by improving the uncertainty measures, by providing robustness against model misspecification, and by assuring the internal consistency of SAEs for different aggregation levels.

4,"Cosmology and particle physics stand at a crossroads. In recent years, scientists have put together a remarkably successful model of cosmic evolution and the extraordinarily well tested Standard Model of elementary particles. In the current cosmological model, a rapid burst of expansion - inflation - occurred a tiny fraction of a second after the Big Bang, laying the seeds for the formation of structure in the Universe. Those seeds have been observed as hot and cold regions in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The assembly of galaxies from those seeds and the vast web of large-scale structure seen in galaxy surveys was shaped by dark matter, which dominates the mass in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Finally, the evidence that the cosmic expansion is now accelerating has become incontrovertible, pointing to a Universe dominated by dark energy or else to a modification of Einstein's theory of General Relativity.

The success of the current cosmology rests upon its three mysterious pillars - inflation, particle dark matter, and dark energy - mysterious because they lie outside the Standard Model of particle physics. Cosmology has shown that the Standard Model is incomplete, and that there is new physics waiting to be discovered. In the coming decade, cosmology can help reveal the new physics underlying inflation, dark matter, and cosmic acceleration, and thereby play a critical role in pointing the way to a new paradigm for fundamental physics. The Physics Frontier Center at the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics (KICP) will bring together astronomers and physicists, theorists, observers and experimentalists, and early-career scientists and senior researchers from across the cosmology community. Since the complexity of these problems requires multiple, complementary approaches, the Center will enable datasets from different experiments to be combined in powerful new ways. As new discoveries are made, the Center will pursue new directions to promptly follow them up. 

Building upon the accomplishments, investments, and lessons learned over the past ten years of PFC funding, the Center focuses upon reaping the science from the projects that were initiated and developed at the KICP - South Pole Telescope (SPT), Dark Energy Survey (DES), Q/U Imaging Experiment (QUIET), and Chicagoland Observatory for Underground Particle Physics (COUPP) - and elsewhere to help solve these big mysteries. Built around the projects, the Center includes eight Major Activities (MAs), five research Hubs, an international Fellows exchange program, yearly hands-on summer schools, and multiple Education & Outreach partnerships. Twenty-one key collaborators have committed to carrying out specific tasks central to the Center. They come from local institutions, education and outreach partners, institutions around the country, and industry. 

Three science MAs are devoted to our research themes: the Inflation MA will take advantage of dramatic advances in measuring CMB polarization to pursue the ""Bmode"" polarization signature of inflation-produced gravity waves, focusing initially on QUIET and SPTpol while laying the groundwork for future experiments. It will also combine CMB and large-scale structure measurements from DES to test whether the underlying density perturbations are Gaussian, as predicted by the simplest models of inflation. The Dark Energy MA will use the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and South Pole Telescope (SPT) and other future projects to probe the physical origin of cosmic acceleration and test the current paradigm - vacuum energy within Einstein's theory of gravity. The Dark Matter MA will synthesize the upcoming wealth of data from particle colliders, satellites, and ultra-sensitive dark matter detectors to confirm or refute the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) hypothesis for dark matter.

Within the three science MAs, five research ""Hubs"" will bring people and projects together to focus on specific challenges. The CMB Polarization Hub will facilitate coordination between different polarization experiments, including joint analysis; the non-Gaussianity Hub will bring together international researchers to constrain or detect non-Gaussianity and test inflation. The Joint Analysis Hub will bring together researchers on SPT and DES and other projects to develop and apply new tools to exploit and optimize galaxy clusters as probes of dark energy; the Supernova Hub will carry out a broad program to improve supernovae as cosmological distance indicators and apply these techniques to new surveys. The Dark Matter Hub will focus on particle theory and model building and signals for dark matter from colliders and indirect detection experiments, complementing the direct detection experiment COUPP and others.

The Fellows MA is the centerpiece activity of the Center. Mentored by the faculty of the Center but given great independence, eleven early-career scientists will be able to shape research programs of their own design, work with faculty, other Fellows, students, and visitors in the interdisciplinary environment of the Center.  They can also participate in an international Fellows exchange program and choose from a broad range of opportunities in education and outreach. All of this is designed to prepare them to be future leaders in cosmology.

Two MAs are devoted to crosscutting, science-enabling activities. Detector Development, strongly leveraged by partnerships with Argonne, Fermilab, and other institutions, will develop innovative detectors to position us to take advantage of early discoveries and to broadly benefit cosmology and other areas of science.  Computational Cosmology will coordinate the high-performance computing resources, both human and hardware, necessary to accomplish our science goals. The Conferences, Workshops, and Visitors MA will provide a program of specialized workshops, large symposia, yearly hands-on summer schools, and a visitors program featuring the David Schramm Distinguished Visiting Professorship to engage and benefit the broader cosmology community and further our science goals.

By design, the broader impacts of the PFC are woven throughout the Center activities. More specifically, the Education, Outreach, & Diversity MA, will spearhead and coordinate a series of activities aimed at broadening the impact of the Center. This MA is strongly coupled to the science in the Center, involves 100% of the PFC faculty members, and has three overarching goals: increasing the diversity of the STEM workforce through programs from K-12 to the professoriate; educating and preparing the next generation of teacher-scholars in an interdisciplinary environment by involving students and Fellows directly in outreach and teaching activities; and advancing the public's understanding and appreciation of science through collaborations with museums and planetariums, and through public lectures and events. This approach to broadening participation includes collaboration with Project Exploration working with the Chicago Public Schools, continuation of the successful Space Explorers K-12 program, partnering with the Fisk-Vanderbilt Masters-to-PhD Bridge program and the University of Texas El Paso to bring students to UChicago for research experiences, supporting and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, and championing diversity in faculty hiring and retention within the Physical Sciences Division at UChicago. The Center will also use technology, developing visualization tools, to integrate research into the undergraduate curriculum and will partner with the Adler Planetarium on cosmology visualizations for a broader audience. Finally, the Conferences, Workshops, and Visitors MA will promote dissemination of cutting-edge research to the broader cosmology community and offer opportunities for those not currently engaged in cosmology research to transition into the field.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, THE",5801 South Ellis Avenue,Chicago,US,Chicago,IL01,University of Chicago,IL,606375418,47.049,,08/18/2011,005421136,17000000,08/31/2019,4900,PHYSICS FRONTIER CENTER,22396929,1125897,005421136,Michael S Turner,5801 South Ellis Avenue,Chicago,US,Chicago,IL01,University of Chicago,IL,606375418,mturner@kicp.uchicago.edu,Michael,Turner,S,7737027974,jcallen@nsf.gov,Jean Cottam Allen,7032928783,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,"[""Belczynski, Krzysztof and Holz, Daniel E. and Bulik, Tomasz and O'Shaughnessy, Richard~The first gravitational-wave source from the isolated evolution of two stars in the 40--100 solar mass range~Nature~534~2016~512--515~~0028-0836~0~ ~0~ ~13/09/2016 18:23:22.133000000"", 'Bridle, S. and Dodelson, S. and Jennings, E. and\n                        Kowalkowski, J. and Manzotti, A. and Paterno, M. and Rudd,\n                        D. and Sehrish, S. and Zuntz, J.~{CosmoSIS}~J.

The Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment

The solution to the problem of dark energy will require a fundamental shift in our understanding of the Universe, and acceptance of any model will require significant corroboration by observations.  The Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) Dark Energy Experiment, HETDEX, offers a technically clean and observationally robust approach to measuring the effects of dark energy.  HETDEX includes an upgrade of the HET for a wider field of view, deployment of the Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS), and completion of a wide field survey which will use 1400 hours of observation to obtain nearly a million redshifts of Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies.  Significant parts of the project are already underway with support from a variety of sources, including substantial private donations.

The survey will determine the local Hubble expansion at redshift 2.4 and measure the angular diameter distance out to that redshift, both to an accuracy of 0.8%, and determine the growth of structure to 2%.  Nearly all other dark energy surveys target lower redshifts, while HETDEX was designed to provide high-redshift information on the evolution of dark energy, as well as being sufficiently powerful to measure dark energy effects even at late times.  HETDEX further will measure the curvature of the Universe to about 0.1%, an order of magnitude better than current projects, and a strong complement to other current and planned studies.  Although HETDEX is optimized for measures of the expansion history, there is significant ancillary science from the survey, such as a collection of spectra of a quarter of a million stars and 1.4 million other galaxies.  Given its capabilities, VIRUS will remain a, if not the, primary instrument for HET for many years.

The significant insights on dark energy, the large database with substantial ancillary science, and the unique and powerful integral field spectrograph on the HET will have a broad impact throughout the astronomical community.  The attraction of the dark energy enigma enables HETDEX to include significant public outreach involving the McDonald Observatory Visitors Center and Stardate radio, including an interactive display for visitors and the involvement of K-12 teachers, as well as a popular webpage at http://www.hetdex.org.",NSF,4900,TEXAS A & M RESEARCH FOUNDATION,"400 Harvey Mitchell Parkway, S",College Station,US,College Station,TX17,Texas A&M Research Foundation,TX,778454321,47.049,['Nicholas B Suntzeff'],08/25/2010,078592789,3920000,08/31/2015,4900,MID-SCALE INSTRUMENTATION,3920000,0928636,078592789,Darren L DePoy,400 Harvey Mitchell Pkwy South,College Station,US,College Station,TX17,Texas A&M University Main Campus,TX,778454375,depoy@physics.tamu.edu,Darren,DePoy,L,,nsharp@nsf.gov,Nigel Sharp,7032924905,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The scientific goal of the HETDEX project is to measure key cosmological parameters when the Universe was roughly 2.5 Gyr old (about 10 Gyr ago). To enable these measurements we had to design and construct a novel piece of instrumentation capable of discovering galaxies at distances of about 20 Gpc away emitting a bright line of hydrogen. The instrument we have built is comprised of about 150 identical spectrographs that, when coupled to an upgraded version of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, will ultimately observe a sizable portion of the observable sky and identify almost 1 million suitable objects, from which we will be able to derive dark energy and other cosmological parameters. Using funds from the NSF, we successfully fabricated and assembled major components of the spectrographs, built and deployed a carefully designed and built enclosure for the spectrograph complement, and developed interesting new techniques for mass production of astronomical instruments, that we feel will have impact on future projects on extremely large telescopes.

A key additional benefit of the project was the training and experience gained by a large number of undergraduate science and engineering majors who were actively involved in the project. These students were able to see all aspects of a large, state-of-the-art technical project, including computer-aided design and manufacturing, optical alignment and assembly processes, general quality control and inventory tracking procedures, and critical documentation. These skills have been shown to be valuable and marketable in the general workplace and our students have found excellent positions with many engineering companies.

6,"This doctoral dissertation research project will test whether state-level Medicaid program design and utilization explains variation in the Medicaid undercount.  Medicaid is the largest source of public health insurance in the United States.  Census surveys significantly underreport Medicaid use compared to administrative records.  The underreporting of Medicaid use in census surveys is problematic, particularly because governmental bodies and researchers rely on this data to make administrative decisions and to determine the budgetary impacts of legislation.  Inaccurate Medicaid measurement can lead to inefficient program implementation and incorrect budgetary projections.  In previous studies, the undercount has been attributed largely to question wording and survey design.  However, there is a lack of research into whether Medicaid program design generates response error in survey self-reports.  This research will use linked census survey and administrate data to generate corrective predicted probabilities of Medicaid use for census surveys.  These predicted probabilities have the potential to help policy makers better understand and account for the needs of the Medicaid population.  Although focused on Medicaid in particular, this study may provide insights into the factors that affect rates of misreporting in other contexts.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, the project will enable a promising student to establish a strong, independent research career.

This project will link census data to Medicaid administrative records to test the theory that the misreporting of Medicaid usage in census surveys is a function of variation in Medicaid program design.  The investigators will run a series of logistic and fixed effects logistic regressions on this linked data to isolate which program features are related to the misreporting of Medicaid usage.  The project also will use a difference-in-differences design to better isolate whether policy shifts play a causal role in the Medicaid undercount.  Coefficients will be generated that can be used to predict the probability of Medicaid enrollment.  These corrective measures will be made available to the Census Bureau, government agencies, and the general public.",NSF,4900,"TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, THE",Research Services,Philadelphia,US,Philadelphia,PA02,University of Pennsylvania,PA,191046205,47.075,['Ashley Anne  Tallevi'],07/09/2015,042250712,16000,06/30/2017,4900,"METHOD, MEASURE & STATS",16000,1534388,042250712,Marc  Meredith,Department of Political Science,Philadelphia,US,Philadelphia,PA02,The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania,PA,191046215,marcmere@sas.upenn.edu,Marc,Meredith,,2158987293,ceavey@nsf.gov,Cheryl L. Eavey,7032928763,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"This award was given to one of my graudate students to support her efforts to link survey and administrative data in order to better understand what affected whether people who use Medicaid are aware that they were using Medicaid. Her theory was that because many Medicaid users rarely interact with entities that are clearly governmental, many people who use Medicaid would be unaware that they do so. This would help explain the ""Medicaid Undercount"", the empirical finding that fewer people report using Medicaid in survey than we know who use Medicaid in the aggregate according to administartive data. Unfortuantely, the Census ultimately decided that performing the proposed linkage between the survey and administrative records presented too much risk to a survey respondent's anonymity. While we were disappointed by this decision and tried multiple times to refine the protocol so that these risks could be minimized, we were unable to come up with a record linkage protocol that the Census was ok with. Ultimately, this meant that the student used other sources of data to do this investigation. Using these data, she found evidence that supported her theory. Because she was unable to use to the money she has returned it to NSF.

7,"The Cooperative Election Study is a data infrastructure project involving the collaboration of research teams from over 70 different academic institutions.  Collectively, these research teams have fielded national surveys of 35,000 adults in 2006, 37,000 in 2008, and, with partial funding from NSF, 54,000 in 2010 and 55,000 in 2012.  Each research team that wishes to be involved in the project purchases a 1,000 person sample survey from the same firm.  Each individual team determines half of the questions on its survey.  The other half of the content, Common Content, is created by a design committee, drawn from the participating teams.  Common Content consists of questions that every team would like to measure or questions that are of broad interest and require a very large sample.  The project, thus, fields as many as the there are teams and also produces a single large sample survey that consists of the Common Content.  With 35 teams in 2006, there were 35 individual team surveys each with a sample of 1,000 and a single common survey of 35,000 cases.  

The survey, through the use of modules, encompasses a vast range of research topics that individual teams seek to answer.  Researchers have used their team modules to conduct standard survey research on particular themes and questions for which appropriate public use data are not available.  Others have used their modules to conduct experiments with political advertisements, pictures of candidates, information about the economy, and other treatments.  Since its inception, the survey has produced studies that have appeared in over 100 journal articles and dozens of books.  These include over a dozen articles that appeared in the top journals in the discipline as well as articles in law, sociology, statistics, and economics.  Studies utilizing this data have focused on a wide variety of topics including elections, voting behavior, public opinion, political parties and polarization, the opinion on wars and other military interventions.

The survey has helped to create and sustain a network of researchers interested in state and national elections, survey design, and public opinion.  Participants have included graduate students and undergraduates who not normally have access to surveys of this size.  These participants develop research skills especially in the area of questionnaire design, and generate further research ideas that can be pursued through this or other vehicles.  Additionally, the scholars involved in this project will continue to use the data to develop educational material relating to the survey that can be adopted widely as part of Political Science undergraduate and graduate curricula.",NSF,4900,PRESIDENT AND FELLOWS OF HARVARD COLLEGE,1033 MASSACHUSETTS AVE,Cambridge,US,Cambridge,MA05,Harvard University,MA,021385366,47.075,"['Brian  Schaffner', 'Samantha C Luks']",08/29/2014,082359691,399913,08/31/2016,4900,POLITICAL SCIENCE,399913,1430505,001963263,Stephen  Ansolabehere,1350 Massachusetts Avenue,Cambridge,US,Cambridge,MA05,President and Fellows of Harvard College,MA,021383846,sda@gov.harvard.edu,Stephen,Ansolabehere,,6172535236,bhumes@nsf.gov,Brian D. Humes,7032927284,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Study conducted a survey of 54,000 adults in the United States to understand better the attitudes and opinions of the American public and voting behavior in the 2014 elections. Participants in the survey were recruited to provide a nationally  representative sample, and they were interviewed two times, in October,  before the eleciton, and in November, after the election. This survey is the largest publicly available academic survey about public opinion and elections conducted in the United States. 

Research teams from 48 different universities, involving hundreds of faculty and students across the United States, helped design the survey.   Each research team purchased a module (a 1,000 to 2,000 person sample) and each module consisted of questions asked every module and questions unique to that team's survey.   The questions common to each survey were combined into a single survey dataset, called the Common Content survey.   That Common Content dataset consists of 54,000 responses to the questions asked on every survey.   In addition, each team received a survey dataset consisting of 1,000 to 2,000 responses to the questions unique to that Team's survey.  In this way, the Cooperative Congressional Election Study coordinates many different research team's projects to create a very large sample survey of the entire United States. 

The main products from this study are the datasets and surveys produced through the collaboration.  The 2014 CCES grant produced 49 distinct surveys, the Common Content Survey and 48 Team Surveys.  The Common Content and Team data are provided to the public for free through the Harvard University IQSS Dataverse.  http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/cces/publications?page=1  To date there have already been 4,600 downloads of the Common Content database, and that is in addition to the distribution of the databases directly to the teams. To date there have been 35,000 downloads of CCES Common Content databases.

Further, researchers use the data developed using the CCES platform to write research articles and books about public opinion, voting behavior, and representation in the United States.  These data are also widely used in undergraduate and graduate student research projects and theses, as well as for instructional examples for data analysis and survey research design.

8,"The 2018 CCES is a collaboration of over 50 different university research teams throughout the United States.   Collectively this group designs and fields a large sample survey of at least 50,000 American adults. The survey measures demographics, opinions, and attitudes.  The very large sample size allows researchers to have sufficient data to study states as well as the entire nation. The CCES, which started in 2006, makes available at very low cost a survey platform that is open to all.   Since its inception, the project has involved more than 100 different research teams and hundreds of faculty and student researchers, and it has conducted interviews with over 250,000 American adults. The data from this project are used widely by researchers, journalists, and members of the public to understand public opinion. Few, if any, data infrastructure ventures in the discipline can boast participation from as many institutions and scholars as CCES has facilitated. The survey helps to create and sustain a network of researchers interested in survey design and public opinion.

The 2018 CSES is developed by a consortium of research teams.   Each research team that wishes to be involved in the project purchases a 1,000-person sample survey from the same firm.   Each individual team determines half of the questions on its survey. The other half of the content (Common Content) is created by a design committee, drawn from the participating teams.

The project, thus, fields as many surveys as there are teams and also produces a single large sample survey that consists of the Common Content.   The Common Content is designed by a committee in consultation with all teams involved in the survey.  The survey will be fielded over the Internet, with samples constructed to be nationally representative.  Each team will receive the data from its own 1,000-person survey and a dataset consisting of the 50,000+ observations from the Common Content survey.  Survey data are validated using comparisons of state level election results to the survey results from the subsamples for each state.

10,"General Summary

The 2016 Cooperative Congressional Study (CCES) is a collaboration of over 50 different university research teams throughout the United States.   Collectively this group designs and fields a large sample survey of at least 50,000 American adults. The survey measures demographics, political opinions and attitudes, and electoral behavior, especially in the congressional elections, but also in the Presidential election and state elections.  The very large sample size allows researchers to have sufficient data to study state electorates as well as the entire nation.  The survey is used to study who votes and why, and what explains the choices that voters make.   The CCES, which started in 2006, makes available at very low cost a survey platform that is open to all.   Since its inception, the project has involved more than 100 different research teams and hundreds of faculty and student researchers, and it has conducted interviews with over 250,000 American adults. The survey helps to create and sustain a network of researchers interested in state and national elections, survey design, and public opinion.  

Technical Summary

The 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Survey is developed by a consortium of research teams.   Each research team that wishes to be involved in the project purchases a 1,000-person sample survey from the same firm.  Each individual team determines half of the questions on its survey. The other half of the content (Common Content) is created by a design committee, drawn from the participating teams.  Common Content consists of questions that every team would like to measure or questions that are of broad interest and require a very large sample.  The project, thus, fields as many surveys as there are teams and also produces a single large sample survey that consists of the Common Content.   The Common Content is designed by a committee in consultation with all teams involved in the survey.  The survey will be fielded over the Internet, with samples constructed to be nationally representative.  Each team will receive the data from its own 1,000-person survey and a dataset consisting of the 50,000+ observations from the Common Content survey.  Survey data are validated using voter validation and through comparisons of state level election results to the survey results from the subsamples for each state. The data produced by this project will be a 2016 Common Content dataset, along with accompanying contextual data, as well as separate Team Content datasets and will be available on the CCES Dataverse website.",NSF,4900,PRESIDENT AND FELLOWS OF HARVARD COLLEGE,1033 MASSACHUSETTS AVE,Cambridge,US,Cambridge,MA05,Harvard University,MA,021385369,47.075,"['Brian  Schaffner', 'Samantha C Luks']",05/10/2016,082359691,586407,10/31/2018,4900,POLITICAL SCIENCE,630407,1559125,001963263,Stephen  Ansolabehere,1737 Cambridge Street,Cambridge,US,Cambridge,MA05,Harvard University,MA,021383016,sda@gov.harvard.edu,Stephen,Ansolabehere,,6172535236,bhumes@nsf.gov,Brian D.

What unites us as Americans? What divides us? What are core Americans values and ideals today? Who belongs and who does not? The nature and meaning of unity, social solidarity, and collective identity in the United States have been a source of question and contention since the nation?s founding. And the challenges have become increasing prolific and complicated in an era of ongoing immigration, increasing diversity, persistent inequality, and ubiquitous multiculturalism. The investigators will study the dynamics of social inclusion and exclusion in contemporary American society. More specifically, they will study the contours of the American identity and the ways in which it is constituted in or crosscut by other salient boundaries. The research focuses on race and religion as aspects of social location and identification which may shape how Americans make sense of their own lives, understand who is like them and who is different, and think about the broader society and the public good. 

The research questions will be answered through a web-based survey of 3,000 Americans. The study extends the work of a previous research project, the American Mosaic Project, by replicating specific items from that study in order to establish trend data for its more innovative and influential findings; this includes items on cultural membership, anti-Semitism, conceptions of diversity, white identity, and views of religious minorities. In addition, the project will include new survey questions to extend research in four interconnected substantive areas: (1) Americans? understandings of social solidarity and collective identity; (2) Americans? explanations for inequality, equal opportunity, and colorblindness; (3) white privilege and white racial identity; and (4) religious exclusion. The project builds on previous work by developing a full set of indicators that allow the investigators to focus on interconnections across our four core areas, providing an opportunity to test and build theory about the relationship between cultural boundaries, inequality, and collective identity. 

Broader Impact 

In this era of divisive politics, culture wars, pundits, and talking points, this project will provide rigorous empirical data with which to make sense of how people understand American society, its goals and challenges. Results from the project will be disseminated through both academic and media outlets, providing opportunities to discuss the American mosaic in both classrooms and public forums. Additionally, this project will provide research opportunities and training for graduate students and undergraduate students at several colleges and universities across the country and will specifically seek to include students who are members of underrepresented groups.

Our survey is a 10-year followup to the American Mosaic Project survey, fielded in 2003.  Our survey replicates some of the Mosaic survey topics and questions, and will allow us to compare over-time variation in Americans attitudes toward racial and religious minorities, understandings of African-American inequality and white privilege, and commitment to specific racial and religious identities.  In addition, our new survey will measure: attitudes toward a wider range of religious outsiders, policy preferences including attitudes toward affirmative action, and willingness to deny civil liberties.  Taken as a whole, we have produced a survey instrument that can help us to understand Americans' understandings of fundamental questions at the heart of our civic life and collective identity.  How do Americans understand, ""Who is like me?"" and ""Who is different?"" What are the broad patterns in racial and religious tolerance in the United States, and how do American understand and value diversity?  We are at work now on a series of papers that will help to answer these questions. Our first papers will explore: Americans' attitudes toward atheists and Muslim-Americans, perceptions of white privilege and African-American inequality, and religious determinants of racial attitudes.

15,"This project will plan a national study of recent and long-term trends in social mobility between generations in the United States. The National Research Council will ask scientific experts to write papers that explore survey design, instrument choice, variable choice, and analytical approach. These papers, together with discussion at the associated workshop, will inform a published summary. A second meeting of a smaller group will evaluate ideas aired at the workshop, discuss next steps, and begin writing a proposal for the new study.

The U.S. is often understood to be a ""land of opportunity"" in which everyone can express their talents and meet their material needs. Thus, the public might imagine that the U.S. regularly monitors trends in intergenerational mobility, ensuring that policy makers and citizens know how much opportunity there is and how fairly it is distributed. That is not the case. Four decades have passed since the last large-scale national mobility survey, yet American society is vastly changed. The nation has seen increased income inequality, an altered industrial and occupational structure, rising immigration, changes in racial and ethnic composition, more complicated family structures, and changes in education and training. The effects of these changes should be assessed in a large-scale study of social mobility.

Two large national surveys, in 1962 and 1973, provided the first reliable evidence on social mobility, led to new methods for measuring mobility, encouraged comparable surveys in dozens of countries, and ultimately changed the national conversation on the extent of mobility and how it might be increased.

At the meeting, top experts in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences presented and discussed a series of nine concept papers addressing the main problems that must be solved in developing a new survey protocol. 
 A summary of the workshop was been published by the National Academy Press, Developing New National Data on Social Mobility: A Workshop Summary (2013). Papers from the workshp have been published in the Annals of American Academy of Political and Social Science (January 2015).  
Three follow-on meetings of the steering committee which featured a discussion of approaches to developing survey/administrative data on the subject were held at the NRC Beckman Center in Irvine, CA in August 2013, March 2014 and August 2014.  The steering committee heard from Census Bureau experts who proposed a mixed administrative, decennial Census and from survey-based data system and experts in matching and linking data files.
As a result of these NSF-funded meetings, the National Research Council (NRC), through its Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT), now proposes to oversee the creation of the American Opportunity Study (AOS), a novel, durable, large-scale, national resource for studies of educational, occupational, and economic mobility across and within generations. By permitting on-demand links of existing censuses, administrative data (e.g., IRS and Social Security data), and other survey data (e.g., the American Community Survey), it will provide reliable, longitudinal measurements for the entire population and important population subgroups, such as those defined by race-ethnicity, national origin, generational status, education, gender, age, and geographic location. It will illuminate contemporary levels, differentials, and trends in mobility, and also provide valid comparisons with past decades. Once established, it will be relatively inexpensive to carry the AOS forward. The proposal is for the first phase of a multi-phase activity, which is expected to lead to an operational AOS and which will be overseen by an NRC standing committee of demographers, sociologists, economists, statisticians, and other relevant experts. The standing committee will not issue reports but may identify topics that warrant consideration in a public workshop with a published workshop summary. The first phase, to extend over 24 months, will encompass detailed planning for the AOS and, most importantly, the development and testing of data capture and linkage procedures to permit attachment of identifiers to records from the 1990 census (which, unlike subsequent censuses, did not electronically capture such information). In turn, such identifiers will permit linking the census data over time and with other data sets. This work will be carried out in the secure protected environment of one of the U.S. Census Bureau's Research Data Centers. Private foundation funding is being secured for this follow-on activity.
Members of the steering committee for the expert meeting were:  Matt Snipp, Stanford; David Grusky, Stanford; Tim Smeeding, Wisconsin; Sean Reardon, Stanford; Sara McLanahan, Princeton; Robert Mare, UCLA; Henry Brady, Berkeley; Mike Hout, NYU; and Robert Hauser, NRC.

16,"While spending on higher education represents a substantial portion of government expenditures and while the importance of the early portion of individuals' working lives has been well-recognized, policymakers are currently faced with the task of designing effective policies with only an incomplete understanding of many important issues related to the college and early post-college periods. This project combines the collection of state-of-the-art survey (and administrative) data with innovative analyses to provide new evidence about many of these issues.

What takes place during the college portion of one's lifetime has traditionally been somewhat of a black box in which students are observed entering with certain observable background characteristics and are eventually seen leaving having made a variety of decisions and having realized a number of related outcomes. Similarly, what takes place during the early portion of one's post-college lifetime has also traditionally been somewhat mysterious. While recent research has stressed the importance of looking inside the college and early post-college black boxes, evidence about the college period and the early post-college period has remained at best incomplete. This is the case, in large part, because standard longitudinal surveys are often not well-positioned to provide data that allow issues of interest to be studied at their most fundamental levels.

This reality motivates the survey component of the current project which, building on previous research funded by the National Science Foundation, involves the continued collection of a longitudinal survey (the Berea Panel Study) that is unequaled in its depth and detail. The survey efforts pay careful attention to recent advances in survey methodology, and, at the culmination of the three-year project period, two cohorts of college students will have been followed very closely from the time they entered college until past the age of thirty.

From a feasibility standpoint, the importance of collecting person-specific information that is substantially more detailed than what is available from other existing data sources necessitates the focus on a single institution (Berea College). However, while this influences the exact extent to which the conclusions can be generalized, it seems reasonable to believe that the basic elements that go into the decisions of students in the collected sample will be generally similar to those that go into the decisions of individuals from similar backgrounds who enroll at other schools. Thus, the innovative nature of the survey collection efforts has the potential to provide policymakers with a much improved understanding of the workings of the higher education process and the early post-college period.

At its most general level, the goal of the data collection in the project is to allow analyses which provide new understandings of how earnings/wages are determined at different stages of the early post-college period. This, in turn, requires one to understand:
1) what determines a person's stock of human capital (i.e., his skills and abilities) at the time he/she leaves college and at different points in the early post-college period?
and
2) how do individuals make decisions that determine how much and what type of human capital is accumulated?
Then the need for an ambitious data collection effort comes from the fact that virtually all decisions and outcomes in the college and early post-college periods are of relevance for understanding these two questions.

Many important decisions and outcomes that ultimately influence earnings take place during college. While much previous research has related decisions and outcomes during college to a set of observable background characteristics of students, it is much more difficult to understand the underlying processes by which decisions are made or outcomes are produced. This is the case, in large part, because a particular decision or outcome may be influenced by a rather large and potentially complicated set of factors. As such, an important feature of the data collection is that, paying close attention to economic theory, the survey instruments were designed to collect information about comprehensive sets of factors that could influence a variety of college decisions/outcomes. These decisions/outcomes include those related to: educational attainment/drop-out, college major, college grade performance, study effort, peer effects, and social networks.

Other important decisions and outcomes that potentially influence earnings after individuals leave college and enter the workforce, include decisions/outcomes related to:
1) job search and job changing behavior, 2) marriage and fertility, 3) time away from the labor market, 4) the type of jobs held or skills accumulated while on the job. The depth of the Berea Panel Study data allows an examination of these decisions/outcomes, in general, and for different subgroups of the population. For example, of particular importance will be the ability of the survey to provide new evidence about the underlying reasons for differences in earnings by gender.

In addition to the substantive contribution of providing new evidence about the college and early post-college periods, the project will likely motivate/guide future data collection and analyses involving nationally representative samples. Generally, this is the case because the project illustrates the value of collecting detailed longitudinal data with the analyses of very specific models and issues in mind. As one of many specific examples of the broader impacts of the project?s survey efforts, while the interest in expectations data has increased substantially in recent years, much remains unknown about the full potential of using such data in economic contexts.

The Berea Panel Study was perhaps the first longitudinal survey to have a strong focus on the elicitation of expectations data, and the analyses in the project will examine a variety of potential uses for this type of data that would not be possible to examine using other data sources. Moreover, because the longitudinal collection of expectations data allows one to directly measure revisions to expectations, the project will might provide the best direct evidence about the importance of learning per se in determining outcomes in education and the early portion of one's working life.",NSF,4900,BEREA COLLEGE,Berea College,Berea,US,,KY06,Berea College,KY,404040002,47.075,,08/16/2011,001960566,208482,08/31/2014,4900,ECONOMICS,208482,1123546,001960566,Ralph  Stinebrickner,Berea College,Berea,US,Berea,KY06,Berea College,KY,404030002,ralph_stinebrickner@berea.edu,Ralph,Stinebrickner,,4786962988,gkosmopo@nsf.gov,Georgia Kosmopoulou,7032927466,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"What takes place during the college portion of oneÆs lifetime has traditionally been somewhat of a ""black box"" in which students  are observed entering with certain observable background characteristics and are eventually seen leaving having made a variety of decisions and having realized a variety of related outcomes.  Similarly, what takes place during the early portion of oneÆs post-college lifetime has also traditionally been somewhat mysterious.  While recent research has stressed the policy importance of looking inside the college and early post-college black boxes, evidence about the college period and the early post-college period has remained at best incomplete. This is the case, in large part, because standard longitudinal surveys are often not well-positioned to provide data that allow issues of interest to be studied at their most fundamental levels.

Building on previous research funded by the National Science Foundation the project continued the collection of a longitudinal survey (the Berea Panel Study) that is unequaled in its depth and detail.  Two cohorts of college students at Berea College have now been surveyed approximately sixty times from the time they entered college until they reached the age of thirty. The survey design takes advantage of recent advances in survey methodology and provides new insight that will guide future data collection efforts. 

Much of our analysis strives to provide a better understanding of why students from low income families often drop out of college.  Much previous policy discussion and research has centered on the possibility that dropout is often caused by financial difficulties. In ""Learning about academic ability and the college drop-out decision"" ( Journal of Labor Economics, 2012) we provide some of the strongest direct evidence about the most natural alternative &ndash; that dropout often arises because students learn that their academic ability is not as high as they expected.  We find that approximately forty percent of dropout in the first year of college can be attributed to this explanation. The paper also contributes to the understanding of gender differences in educational attainment. Substantial gender differences in drop-out are predicted entirely by gender differences in academic quality (1st year grades and beliefs about future grades), and we provide direct evidence that gender differences in study effort are important.

We continue our investigation of dropout in ""Academic performance and college dropout: Using longitudinal expectations data to estimate a learning model"" (Journal of Labor Economics, 2014).  This paper uses a formal model of the costs and benefits that a student considers when deciding whether to remain in school. The Berea Panel Study is particularly useful in this regard; it was designed with an explicit model of dropout in mind which allows us to substantially reduce the number of assumptions that are required for estimation.

Consistent with our earlier paper, we find that forty-five percent of the dropout that occurs in the first two years of college can be attributed to student learning about academic performance. However, important for policymakers concerned that scarce public resources may be consumed inefficiently if persistent misperceptions lead students to remain in school longer than they otherwise would, the importance of this type of learning becomes less relevant by the midway point of college. Our simulations show that students who perform poorly tend to learn that staying in school is not worthwhile, not that they fail out or learn that they are more likely (than they previously believed) to fail out in the future.  We find that poor performance both substantially decreases the enjoyability of school and substantially influences beliefs about post-college earnings.

Due primarily to the difficulty of obtaining ideal data, much also remains unknown about how a student arrives at his/her final major.

17,"This team will extend their DEEP2 spectroscopic survey, using high dispersion spectra with the DEIMOS multi-object spectrograph at the Keck telescopes for galaxies in the redshift range 0.5 < z < 1.5. This redshift range represents 85% of cosmic history, over the time when most of the galaxy mass was assembled and galaxies formed their disks. The new DEEP3 survey concentrates on the extended Groth strip, an area on the sky that has been observed with many of NASA's great observatories. The team will use these and other archives to compile a panchromatic catalog describing their survey galaxies over a wide wavelength range from radio to X-rays. DEEP3 will push the limit of observations 2.5 times fainter than DEEP2, tripling the number of measured galaxies.

The team will estimate the rate at which their survey galaxies are forming their stars, by measuring their brightness in the ultraviolet, infrared and radio, and by using diagnostics based on the optical emission lines measured in the DEEP2 and DEEP3 surveys. They will investigate a tight relation found in DEEP2 between the rate of star formation in a galaxy and the mass in stars already present, and examine how galaxy environment and morphology affect that relation. Team members will use observations from the DEEP2 and DEEP3 surveys to study how scaling laws such as the Tully-Fisher relation (between a galaxy's luminosity and its circular rotation speed) change over time as disk galaxies are assembled. They will investigate the role of active galactic nuclei in star formation, and use X-ray observations to search for signs of faint hidden active nuclei.

Graduate students and postdoctoral scholars will be trained as they participate in the research. As has been done for the earlier DEEP2 survey, data including redshifts, photometry, and spectra would be released to the astronomical community. Multiwavelength images from DEEP2, along with an interactive redshift catalog, are already available on google sky; more data will be added as the new survey proceeds.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH THE,University Club,Pittsburgh,US,Pittsburgh,PA14,University of Pittsburgh,PA,152132303,47.049,,10/30/2008,004514360,285455,11/30/2015,4900,EXTRAGALACTIC ASTRON & COSMOLO,316758,0806732,004514360,Jeffrey A Newman,University Club,Pittsburgh,US,Pittsburgh,PA14,University of Pittsburgh,PA,152132303,janewman@pitt.edu,Jeffrey,Newman,A,4126247400,nsharp@nsf.gov,Nigel Sharp,7032924905,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Intellectual Merit: Key outcomes of this funding have included:

- The completion of a detailed paper describing the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey, which remains the largest investigation to date on the Keck Telescopes, providing measures of distance and galaxy properties for tens of thousands of galaxies looking back to just a few billion years after the Big Bang;

- The completion of the DEEP3 Galaxy Redshift Survey, which produced more detailed measurements of the properties of well over 10,000 galaxies.  DEEP3 has filled in more details of the DEEP2 map of the distant universe in the Extended Groth Strip, a region of sky where considerable data from every possible space telescope has been assembled, providing a wide variety of constraints on the development of galaxies;

- Contributions to a wide variety of science papers making use of data from DEEP2, DEEP3, and AEGIS (the broader Extended Groth Strip survey);

- Improved determinations of the total mass in stars and the rate of formation of new stars of the Milky Way Galaxy, which contains our solar system. These are key parameters for studying the development of our Galaxy;

- A variety of measurements of the total energy output and color of our Galaxy as would be measured from outside of it, enabling much improved comparisons of our own Galaxy to external objects.  These measurements were obtained by identifying galaxies with similar mass and star formation history to our Galaxy.  If we make Copernicus? assumption that we should not live in a special place in the Universe, one of those Milky Way Analog galaxies must also match the color and brightness of our own enabling these improved measurements;

- Improved determinations of the rate at which the density of our Galaxy?s disk of stars falls as one moves away from the Milky Way?s center.  This is a key parameter for describing the dominant stellar component of a spiral galaxy;

- Investigation of how the Milky Way compares to the relations seen in other spiral galaxies amongst their energy output (or mass), rotation speed, and disk size.  We have found that the Milky Way has a rotation speed matching expectations for its mass, but its disk is compact by almost a factor of two compared to the typical value for a galaxy of its mass or rotation speed; it is further from the core relation than 90% of spiral galaxies.  This anomaly may be connected to the relative paucity of satellite galaxies around the Milky Way which has been previously noted.

 

 

Broader Impacts: This work engaged several graduate students, a number of undergraduates, and one postdoc in forefront astronomical research; the majority of the undergraduates and the postdoc were women. Two graduate students funded by this grant completed their PhD and now are working in data science. The PI has also incorporated this research into classes at all levels from undergraduate general education to graduate courses.  This research facilitated collaborations between U. Pittsburgh, U.C. Berkeley, U.C.S.C., Carnegie Mellon U., and UC Irvine. Data catalogs from the DEEP2 survey have all been publicly released and are being used for a variety of studies. Public release of DEEP3 data is expected to be completed this year.?This work has been described in a wide variety of public lectures regionally.

The work on the color of the Milky Way funded by this grant had an extremely wide impact. It was the subject of an American Astronomical Society press release. The idea that the Milky Way taken as a whole is truly ?white as snow? received press around the globe; for instance, it was the most viewed story at BBC News (the highest-traffic news website in the world) that day.

18,"Two key concerns in sample surveys are bias, caused by inability to reach all sections of the target population (noncoverage) or nonresponse on the part of selected subjects, and variance or lack of precision, caused by inadequate sample sizes.  One approach to increase precision is to fit statistical models to the survey response; however, practical application has been limited by an inability to fit sufficiently flexible models.  The plan of this research is to develop models that incorporate information about the design of the survey and other knowledge, such as population distributions of covariates, that is currently used in classical weighting methods to reduce the bias and variance of sample survey estimates.  A special concern of this approach is to account for the design of the data collection and to make our new methods ""backward compatible"" with existing design-based analysis methods for sample surveys.  Statistically, developing models to account for all the features in a survey design requires research in linear and logistic regression models with complex hierarchical structures among the predictor variables.

The research is intended ultimately to yield routine methods for sample survey inference that combine the flexibility of model-based inference with the reliability of design-based inference.  This work will potentially advance three areas:  statistical sampling inference, Bayesian methods, and the applications of sample surveys, especially in social science and public health.  The modeling approach allows the partial pooling of estimates between different structural levels in the population (for instance, school classrooms and individual students), and is particularly effective for estimating small subpopulations and for dealing with nonresponse that is caused by complex combinations of factors.  For example, in opinion polls a researcher may be interested in differences in opinion between different demographic groups or different regions of the country.  In a public health survey of children, one may wish to identify predictors of high-risk behavior.",NSF,4900,"TRUSTEES OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK, THE",2960 Broadway,NEW YORK,US,New York,NY10,Columbia University,NY,100276902,47.075,,06/21/2000,049179401,254675,06/30/2004,4900,"METHOD, MEASURE & STATS",254675,9987748,049179401,Andrew E Gelman,2960 Broadway,NEW YORK,US,New York,NY10,Columbia University,NY,100276902,gelman@stat.columbia.edu,Andrew,Gelman,E,2128512142,ceavey@nsf.gov,Cheryl L.

19,"Sequential mixed-mode surveys use a mix of modes or data collection methods such as mail, telephone, in-person, and web to increase the number of people who respond to a survey. In sequential designs, there is usually no control in assigning subgroups of respondents to modes. As a result, nonrandom assignment of modes is an inherent characteristic of sequential mixed-mode surveys. This design is important since there are usually limited funds to probe people to respond. While the goal of using mixed modes is clear, one compelling research question is how the nonrandom mix of mode impacts survey data and how these effects should be handled in estimating survey population characteristics such as mean income, and health insurance coverage. To date, since the nonrandom mix of modes poses a challenge in evaluating the mode effects, the existing inference methods assume that mode effects can be ignored in sequential mixed-mode surveys despite their unknown impact on the quality of the survey estimates. This research develops and evaluates the statistical inference methods accounting for nonrandom mode effects to test the comparability of the survey estimates from the different modes. In parallel, this project also develops statistical inference methods accounting for both nonresponse and nonrandom mode effects in the presence of nonignorable mode effects. The public-use Current Population Survey (CPS), 1973, and Social Security Records Exact Match, and the nonpublic-use American Community Survey (ACS) data will be used to conduct empirical and simulation evaluations. 

This research provides federal agencies, survey organizations, research centers, and other data producers assessment and inferential methods that adjust for both nonresponse and nonrandom mode effects in the context of sequential mixed-mode surveys. Some large surveys have employed some variation of mixed-mode surveys in order to meet budget constraints. On the other hand, in the presence of nonignorable mode effects, the bias properties for the survey population characteristics are not known and the existing assessment and inferential methods do not control for the nonrandom mode effects. This research produces sequential mixed-mode assessment methods which will test the ignorability of the mode effects which can be a threat for the quality of survey data. In parallel, this research also produces methods of inference which will yield higher quality survey estimates in the presence of nonignorable mode effects.",NSF,4900,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3003 South State St. Room 1062,Ann Arbor,US,Ann Arbor,MI12,University of Michigan Ann Arbor,MI,481091274,47.075,['Zeynep  Suzer Gurtekin'],08/22/2012,073133571,15153,08/31/2014,4900,"METHOD, MEASURE & STATS",15153,1238612,073133571,Richard L Valliant,3003 S.

Eavey,7032928763,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Work addressed two specific research questions related to multi-mode surveys: 1) Are the measurement error differences between modes ignorable? and 2) What are the properties of statistical inference methods that incorporate nonignorable measurement error differences under a mixed-mode survey design? Work was completed on three alternative mixed-mode survey mean estimators.  The general steps in the estimation method were: 1) Impute counterfactual data for the alternative mode(s) under specified mode choice and response models, 2) Use both observed and actual data for the complete set of respondents to compute mode specific survey means, 3) Adjust for nonresponse, 4) Compare mode specific mean estimates, and 5) Combine mode specific means under three alternative combining rules. Step 1) created data that were counterfactual in the sense that imputations for cases that responded using one mode were made as if they had responded via another mode. For the purpose of this research, nonresponse adjustments were omitted, although future research should address it.

Using 1973 Current Population Survey (CPS)-Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Match Data and 2012 CPS data, comparisons were made between the na&iuml;ve and three alternative methods for Income and Health Insurance Coverage. Three alternative methods were: 1) Simple average estimator, in which mode specific means are combined by using a simple average estimator, 2) Combined estimator in which estimated means are weighted inversely according to their variances, and 3) Combined estimator in which estimated means are weighted inversely according to their mean square errors (MSEs).   A fourth choice was the na&iuml;ve mean estimator ignoring any mode effects, i.e., 4) Combine data together in one sample and estimate the mean ignoring any differences in modes.  An empirical study and a simulation study on 1973 CPS Match Data were conducted to study the bias properties of na&iuml;ve estimator and the three alternative estimators. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using the 2012 CPS data.

The empirical study was conducted on a subset of 1973 CPS-IRS Match Data using wage and salary income as reported in the CPS. CPS-reported wage and salary income for 1972 were compared against the 1972 person-level IRS wage and salary income data. The average relative differences by mode were not significantly different between the CPS in-person and the telephone modes. On the other hand, the direct comparisons of individual in-person respondentsÆ earnings to telephone respondent earnings suggest a possible nonignorable mode choice mechanism, that is, the mode choice mechanism depends on the variable itself. On average, in-person respondents reported their earnings $1,369 less per year than telephone respondents. After controlling for personal characteristics, education, work experience, race (white vs. other), occupation type (professional, sales, craft, laborer), and industry (construction, manufacturing, transportation, trade, service) and residential (household) characteristics, central city, suburb, region, the difference remained significant. The empirical study considers this subset as the population and draws 50 simulation samples under 400/800 sample sizes of persons. In addition to sample size variation, the simulations also varied two imputation methods: 1) ignorable mode choice, and 2) nonignorable mode choice and 1) item missing included, and 2) item missing excluded conditions. The results were in the expected direction. That is, the standard procedure of ignoring potential mode differences led to biased estimators.  The estimator that combined means inversely according to MSEs was generally least biased.  For this estimator to be feasible in practice, one of the modes must be selected as producing the most nearly unbiased estimators.  The differences between item missing excluded and included conditions showed that sensitivity analysis should also be incorporated in selecting an...",,,09/01/2012,Doctoral Dissertation Research: Investigating the Bias of Alternative Statistical Inference Methods in Sequential Mixed-Mode Surveys,Grant
20,"Business leaders and public policymakers worldwide continue to have high interest in identifying the conditions, investments, infrastructure, and policies likely to promote and hasten the pace of innovation by businesses and other economic actors.  Increasingly, surveys of innovation are being developed and used to gauge the incidence of innovation across national economies and to identify the driving variables and relationships.  The European Union has run its Community Innovation Survey (CIS) among member countries regularly since 1992.  CIS-based surveys have also been implemented in many of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and, more recently, in China and some African countries.  In the United States, the National Science Foundation?s new Business R&D and Innovation Survey (BRDIS), first fielded in 2009, includes questions on business innovation drawn from the CIS approach.  

This is an opportune time to review the CIS approach from several perspectives:  what are the CIS questions actually measuring; how well can these measures, transferred to the U.S and other national economies, yield robust statistical results and produce indicators that can be compared over time and with those of other countries using the CIS model; and what might also usefully be measured were new questions to be added.       
                  

Project Description

The proposal outlines a project to conduct an in-depth review of the questions in the CIS and other existing innovation surveys and to develop new and improved questions.  The project would be conducted over two years, as part of an ongoing OECD taskforce on business R&D and innovation survey re-design.

The work program would include cognitive testing of existing questions in English and selected languages, as well as the development and testing of new questions in areas of growing interest in the study of innovation, such as the measurement of intangible assets for innovation. The result would be a set of carefully tested questions and guidelines for their use. These results could be used to extend the coverage of existing surveys, or for new surveys, to produce internationally and inter-temporally comparable indicators of innovation. 

The project would be managed by the Secretariat of the OECD Working Party of National Experts on Science and Technology Indicators (NESTI) -- which includes the European Union and the United States and has observers from the African Union, Brazil, China, and the Russian Federation, the Ibero-American Network on Science and Technology Indicators (RICYT) and the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS).  Participants in this proposed activity would be invited to bring together present work on question testing and methodology, as applied to questions in innovation surveys, and to contribute to an agenda for new work.


Importance and Broader Significance

The intellectual merit of this work arises from the use of leading edge cognitive testing and questionnaire development methods and the application of such methods in the domain of innovation survey questions. Survey design techniques will also benefit from work on a survey instrument that is used in a wide variety of economies and cultures. 

The work will give rise to a community of practice that will continue well beyond the end of the project -- as part of the NESTI membership, supported by the OECD. The impact of the project would be considerable. A better understanding of innovation and its impacts will provide input to policy development directed at fostering business innovation and entrepreneurship. The project?s final report will include detailed assessments of existing questions and will offer new or improved questions to advance the capture of information on innovation. 

For NSF?s BRDIS, adding rigorously tested questions and implementing a reviewed structure will contribute a better understanding of business survey methods.  And with wide dissemination, survey results will support public debate of the role of innovation in the U.S. economy and inform the development of better designed policies. The report will be also available for use internationally, including for survey programs in developing countries.",NSF,4900,ORGANIS COOPERATION DEVELOPP ECONOMIQUE,"2, rue Andre Pascal",Paris,FR,,,Organization For Economic Cooperation & Development,,,47.075,['Fernando  Galindo-Rueda'],04/15/2011,733909030,260000,01/31/2014,4900,SCIENCE RESOURCES STATISTICS,260000,1114138,733909030,Susan  Peric,"2, rue Andre Pascal",Paris,FR,,,Organization For Economic Cooperation & Development,,,susan.peric@oecd.org,Susan,Peric,,0145249361,mboroush@nsf.gov,Mark A. Boroush,7032920000,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Understanding how innovation happens in firms and how it contributes to economic growth and prosperity is a major policy preoccupation. The worldwide statistical community, led by the OECD and Eurostat, agreed in the early 1990s to develop a statistical approach to support the measurement of innovation in firms. This framework, the Oslo Manual, has been used in more than 80 different countries. The framework has proved its value in the context of microeconomic analysis of business performance and plays an important role in the official statistics of several countries in the OECD and beyond.

However, there are significant measurement and interpretation problems with the data, often resulting in some paradoxical results, especially at a macro level. Innovation can be a fuzzy and highly subjective concept. It therefore needs to be operationalized in a meaningful way for the users of the information but also to ensure that survey respondents understand what they are being asked about and provide the requested information in a consistent manner, so that appropriate comparisons and benchmarks can be made.

For this particular reason, the Manual has been in constant evolution to ensure the robustness of the approach and the validity and internationally comparability of the results, building on a wide range of research and validation methodologies. This project has focused on the use of cognitive interviewing and testing methods as the research tool with which to carry out a diagnosis of the framework and make recommendations on how it should be improved.

The use of cognitive testing techniques is not new to the field of innovation statistics. What is novel to this OECD-led project is that cognitive testing has been applied for the first time to both European and non-European countries within a same exercise. Another key novelty of this research project is that the discipline of cognitive interviews has been applied not only to specific questions but also to the basic concepts and definitions traditionally promoted by OECD and Eurostat. The OECD has coordinated a project involving consultants and representatives from volunteer OECD member countries who have co-developed survey protocols and applied them to firms within their countries.

The project has helped retrieve valuable information which countries have hitherto kept to themselves. From a prior assumption that testing had been very limited, it was possible to show there were plenty useful experiences to draw upon, meriting further dissemination, particularly among new practitioners in the field.

Through the process of developing and implementing in-depth interviews with business, the project has contributed to an improved understanding of how business managers, the target of innovation surveys, perceive and report innovation. The findings indicate that the framework has succeeded at some levels at capturing how firms perceive innovations but also highlight some significant degree of rejection and confusion about some concepts and their implementation in surveys.

The project has also assessed a number of approaches for dealing with some of the limitations identified in the scoping interviews, postulating the use of new questions approach and even suggesting the use of vignette as possible mechanisms for addressing the inherent subjectivity of responses. Among the key findings, it is possible to highlight the following:

The need to place more emphasis on new-to-market innovations, identifying the appropriate way of dealing with changes that are only new to the firm, which most interviewees did not describe as innovations.
The need to address, and possibly, avoid the use of ""significantly improved"" as a qualifier of innovations. 
The need to address the artificial &ndash;in the view of managers&ndash; separation between some forms of process and organisational innovations. This appears to be achievable with a reconsolidation of some of the existing categories.

Surveys represent a key source of data in a wide range of scientific disciplines, and are often an important input in public and corporate decision-making processes. While the primary use of survey data is to describe the population from which the sample was drawn, analysts are increasingly using those data to make inference about statistical models. This use of survey data in model estimation and analysis is referred to as analytic inference for survey data.  Survey data producing organizations usually recommend that survey weights be used in all model fitting with survey data, in order to account for the sampling design and the post-sampling adjustments.  This often significantly complicates the work of data analysts, in large part because the effect of survey weighting in analytic inference is still incompletely understood.  This research will explore some long-standing open issues in analytic inference for surveys.  First, within the survey-weighted mode of inference, the PIs will investigate improved variance estimation methods and distributional theory. Second, they will evaluate a number of alternatives to survey weighting in model fitting and inference. This research will advance the state of knowledge in how to properly conduct analytic inference for survey data by bringing together concepts, methods and approaches from survey statistics and other areas of statistics. Ultimately, it will enhance the ability of data analysts to conduct perform analytic inference for survey data.

22,"Democracy depends in part on an informed citizenry voting for leaders to govern them. Yet what incentives do citizens have to invest in gathering information about politics--in particular, about an election on the horizon? What incentives and disincentives do citizens face when it comes time to vote? These two fundamental questions lay the basis for a third: How do the costs of voting affect incentives to invest in information?

This project sheds new light on these questions by conducting field experiments during the 2011 San Francisco Municipal Election. A recent model predicts that increasing incentives to participate will increase aggregate information and informed voting, but will not increase uninformed voting. The effect is strongest when the cost of information is low. This project features an experimental design that will test the effect of participation costs on incentives to invest in political information. 

Whereas most mobilization studies focus exclusively on turnout effects, this experiment integrates a mobilization study with a panel survey design, to compare information acquisition in the treatment and control populations over the course of the electoral campaign. One treatment will reduce the cost of voting by helping subjects register to vote, locate polling places, and become aware of the options for early voting and absentee voting. Another treatment will increase the cost of abstention by informing subjects that voter turnout records are observable and will be documented. In addition, the researcher includes experimental treatments that integrate varying access to low-cost information, in order to identify the effect of participation costs in varying information environments. The information treatment enables a direct test of whether the cost of voting or the cost of information is most responsible for discouraging informed voting. The panel survey design also enables a unique opportunity to isolate other effects of participation, such as changes in partisanship, trust in government, and efficacy. 

The research will not only contribute to the theoretical literature on the relationship between information and voting but will also be of interest to policy makers. Does more participation mean less informed participation? Is there a way to increase participation without decreasing the information quality in the active electorate? How can electoral policy motivate an increase in informed voters? At the very least, this study will increase political information and participation among the subjects in the experiments, a small group of young citizens. At the most, it will help identify the best methods by which underrepresented groups can be recruited into the political process, so that their voices will be both informed and included.",NSF,4900,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,70 WASHINGTON SQUARE S,NEW YORK,US,New York,NY10,New York University,NY,100121019,47.075,"['Victoria  Shineman', 'Rebecca  Morton']",06/20/2011,041968306,11986,05/31/2012,4900,POLITICAL SCIENCE,11986,1065771,041968306,Eric  Dickson,70 WASHINGTON SQUARE S,NEW YORK,US,New York,NY10,New York University,NY,100121019,esd2@nyu.edu,Eric,Dickson,,2129982121,bhumes@nsf.gov,Brian D. Humes,7032927284,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Motivation &ndash; Low participation is of particular concern because voters are not always a representative sample of the population. This difference between voters and non-voters might lead disadvantaged groups to not receive equal representation, introducing normative concerns relating to democratic ideals, as well as implications for the stability of democratic institutions. However, comparative studies suggest that non-voters tend to be less informed than voters. A series of simulated election outcomes suggests that full turnout would produce a less informed electorate. Because random or uninformed votes add noise &ndash; not representation &ndash; some scholars have suggested that low participation might be preferable. I challenge this literature by arguing that information levels are not fixed. I emphasize that the individual decision of whether or not to invest in information is endogenous to whether an individual expects to participate. Put simply, I argue that decreasing costs (or increasing incentives) to participate will also motivate citizens to invest in the acquisition of political information and informed voting.

Research Design &ndash; I pursue this argument through experimental innovations that increase the ability to make causal inferences. My experiment demonstrates that mobilizing people to vote will also motivate them to increase their investment in the types of political information that are necessary to make a good vote choice. Specifically, I designed and executed a field experiment integrating a mobilization treatment and an information treatment into a panel survey completed by 349 subjects before and after the November 2011 San Francisco Municipal Election.

The experimental design varied the presence of two treatment variables in a 2x2 design to create four treatment groups. The mobilization treatment included a series of actions intended to reduce costs and increase incentives to participate in the election. The information treatment provided subjects with unbiased factual information about the candidates and ballot propositions in the election. In order to generate balance of demographic measures and pre-treatment political engagement across treatment groups, preliminary information about each subject was gathered in a brief pre-survey questionnaire. I used this data to randomly assign treatment groups using a stratified block design. All subjects conducted the first survey in person at an office in downtown San Francisco, received their respective treatment after completing the first survey, and completed the second survey online immediately after the election. The post-election survey measured information levels regarding the eight ballot referenda, the rules of ranked-choice voting, and the candidates competing for Mayor, Sheriff, and District Attorney. Actual voter turnout records were validated using the official Voter History File. The mobilization treatment increased voter turnout by over 35 percentage points, successfully creating a strong case of exogenously-driven participation.

Result &ndash; Subjects exposed to the mobilization treatment demonstrate post-election information levels that are significantly higher than subjects who were not exposed to the mobilization treatment. This effect occurred both with and without the accompanying information treatment. This supports the hypothesis that mobilizing people to cast a ballot will also motivate them to increase investment in the types of political information that are necessary to make a good vote choice.

Intellectual merit &ndash; The theoretical literature is rich and growing, but empirical studies trying to estimate the effect of increasing participation on political information and informed voting previously produced inconclusive results. The study of this question was impeded by the difficulty in establishing good comparisons.

The two conferences brought together leading scholarly experts on topics that fit into four broad areas.  First, discussion on challenges faced in conventional survey research covered a broad landscape, including key topics such as: probability versus non-probability sampling methods; multi-mode survey techniques; optimizing response rates and how nonresponse affects survey accuracy; use of incentives in survey collection; survey design, visual displays and cognitive evaluation of survey instruments; proxy reporting; interviewing techniques and challenges; confidentiality, respondent attrition and data attrition; and computation of survey weights. 

The second category of exploration focused on opportunities to expand data collection, including: paradata; the use of leave-behind measurement supplements and biomarkers; and specialized tools for measuring past events.  Third, several methods of linking survey data with external sources was discussed, specifically: improving government, academic and industry data-sharing opportunities; linking survey data to official government records or with the Catalist Commercial Database; linking knowledge networks web panel data with external data; and the use of election administration data with other datasets. Lastly, discussion turned to improving research transparency and data dissemination, with a focus on: data curation; evaluating the usability of survey project websites; and the broader topic of the credibility of survey-based social science.

Project Outcomes

With partial support from the National Science Foundation, the International Conference on Methods for Surveying and Enumerating Hard-to-Reach Populations (H2R) was held in New Orleans from October 31 to November 3, 2012. This conference brought together more than 300 researchers from an array of disciplines and from 20 countries to discuss current best practices and to encourage new research and experimentation addressing the fundamental question of how we can successfully count and survey hard-to-reach populations. The American Statistical Association published the conference proceedings online in early 2013.  The American Association for Public Opinion Research created a Webinar series to broadcast selected papers to a broader audience; the first Webinar was held in April 2013.  Later this year Cambridge Press is expected to publish a monograph with 32 chapters; each chapter began as an invited paper presented at the conference.  Selected contributed papers are expected to appear in special issues of the Journal of Official Statistics and Survey Research in 2013 as well.

Intellectual Merit

The H2R conference was a forum for researchers to share information about
challenges, approaches, and successful strategies in surveying the hard-to-reach.  The field has produced extensive literature about individual surveys and particular hard-to-survey populations, but it is difficult to generalize from this literature to arrive at common principles or to develop theories or conceptual frameworks. The conference was an important step in improving our knowledge of survey methods for the hard-to-reach.  It created a venue for researchers to discuss and compare their experiences across all aspects of the survey process and all types of hard-to-survey populations.  Innovations in community participation, sample design, instrument development, interviewer training, subject recruitment, data collection, processing, analysis, data dissemination and survey management were presented.  (Of particular note was the session on respondent driven sampling; many participants reported in their evaluations that it was the standout session of the conference.) These conference achievements set the stage for advances in the field that will benefit survey researchers and studies of populations that are difficult to survey.

Broader Impacts

Data from population surveys and censuses are perhaps the most widely
used source for making social policy and program decisions.  For example, in the U.S., data from the decennial census are used to make program and service funding decisions totaling in the trillions of dollars from one census to the next; more globally, the Demographic and Health Surveys Programme (DHS) collects data from over 75 countries on health and health provision. Often, these data collections take place to address policy or program issues specific to hard-to-reach populations --  for example, to understand income and program participation among low income households, health care access among recent immigrants, food insufficiency among nomadic tribes, safe-sex practices among sexual minorities, or post-intervention evaluation among drug users.  Invariably, however, researchers find themselves in an unenviable situation:  the very population critical to the survey is also the population least likely to participate (or hardest to trace). In the last two decades the survey climate has shifted, such that overall participation is waning, and is reflected in
lower cooperation rates, lower response rates, and lower coverage rates. As a
result, concerns are growing about nonresponse bias and the validity of our
data to make sound policy decisions. The H2R conference led researchers to
apply new and improved methods for including hard-to-survey populations in
these programs, thus i...",,,05/01/2012,"International Conference on Methods for Surveying and Enumerating Hard-to-Reach Populations (Oct 31-Nov 3, New Orleans, LA)",Grant

Project Outcomes

With partial support from the National Science Foundation, the International Conference on Methods for Surveying and Enumerating Hard-to-Reach Populations (H2R) was held in New Orleans from October 31 to November 3, 2012. This conference brought together more than 300 researchers from an array of disciplines and from 20 countries to discuss current best practices and to encourage new research and experimentation addressing the fundamental question of how we can successfully count and survey hard-to-reach populations. The American Statistical Association published the conference proceedings online in early 2013.  The American Association for Public Opinion Research created a Webinar series to broadcast selected papers to a broader audience; the first Webinar was held in April 2013.  Later this year Cambridge Press is expected to publish a monograph with 32 chapters; each chapter began as an invited paper presented at the conference.  Selected contributed papers are expected to appear in special issues of the Journal of Official Statistics and Survey Research in 2013 as well.

Intellectual Merit

The H2R conference was a forum for researchers to share information about
challenges, approaches, and successful strategies in surveying the hard-to-reach.  The field has produced extensive literature about individual surveys and particular hard-to-survey populations, but it is difficult to generalize from this literature to arrive at common principles or to develop theories or conceptual frameworks. The conference was an important step in improving our knowledge of survey methods for the hard-to-reach.  It created a venue for researchers to discuss and compare their experiences across all aspects of the survey process and all types of hard-to-survey populations.  Innovations in community participation, sample design, instrument development, interviewer training, subject recruitment, data collection, processing, analysis, data dissemination and survey management were presented.  (Of particular note was the session on respondent driven sampling; many participants reported in their evaluations that it was the standout session of the conference.) These conference achievements set the stage for advances in the field that will benefit survey researchers and studies of populations that are difficult to survey.

Broader Impacts

Data from population surveys and censuses are perhaps the most widely
used source for making social policy and program decisions.  For example, in the U.S., data from the decennial census are used to make program and service funding decisions totaling in the trillions of dollars from one census to the next; more globally, the Demographic and Health Surveys Programme (DHS) collects data from over 75 countries on health and health provision. Often, these data collections take place to address policy or program issues specific to hard-to-reach populations --  for example, to understand income and program participation among low income households, health care access among recent immigrants, food insufficiency among nomadic tribes, safe-sex practices among sexual minorities, or post-intervention evaluation among drug users.  Invariably, however, researchers find themselves in an unenviable situation:  the very population critical to the survey is also the population least likely to participate (or hardest to trace). In the last two decades the survey climate has shifted, such that overall participation is waning, and is reflected in
lower cooperation rates, lower response rates, and lower coverage rates. As a
result, concerns are growing about nonresponse bias and the validity of our
data to make sound policy decisions. The H2R conference led researchers to
apply new and improved methods for including hard-to-survey populations in
these programs, thus i...",,,05/01/2012,"International Conference on Methods for Surveying and Enumerating Hard-to-Reach Populations (Oct 31-Nov 3, New Orleans, LA)",Grant
26,"Every request to take part in a survey is framed in some way.  This project consists of a set of experiments that investigate how the presentation of the survey request affects nonresponse and measurement error.  The experiments are guided by a theory of survey participation (the salience-leverage theory) that claims that people decide whether to take part in a survey based on whatever aspects of the survey are made salient in the presentation of the survey request and on how they evaluate those features.  Two initial experiments randomly vary the description of the topic and sponsor of the survey, with hypothesized effects both on nonresponse propensities and on reporting.  In the third experiment, survey design features that can mediate or reduce the error-producing influences of the survey topic and sponsor will be examined.  Thus, the project experimentally tests mechanisms producing nonresponse bias and measurement errors and, once these effects have been documented, provides guidance to the survey practitioner about how to reduce their impact.

While the research is theoretically motivated and features experimental control, there are important practical implications of the work for the federal statistical agencies and the larger survey community.  Sometimes estimates of key social indicators (e.g., the prevalence of rape or the frequency of defensive use of handguns) vary widely across surveys.  The effects explored in this project may help explain these discrepancies.  In addition, this work will a) help agencies conducting surveys anticipate when different sponsors may obtain different results, b) provide evidence about potentially harmful effects on nonresponse error and measurement error of emphasizing a single purpose of a survey, and c) produce evidence regarding design features that can reduce the effects of the presentation of the survey on nonresponse and measurement error.",NSF,4900,"WESTAT, INC.",1600 RESEARCH BLVD,Rockville,US,Rockville,MD08,Westat Inc,MD,208500319,47.075,,03/28/2012,049508120,71269,05/31/2013,4900,"METHOD, MEASURE & STATS",71269,1225617,049508120,Roger  Tourangeau,,,US,Rockville,MD08,Westat Inc,MD,208500319,RogerTourangeau@Westat.com,Roger,Tourangeau,,3012942828,ceavey@nsf.gov,Cheryl L.

27,"In this research, Dr. Evans and his team study star formation over wide scales. The idea is to connect knowledge about star formation on small scales in dense clumps of molecular clouds in our Galaxy to overall star formation processes in other galaxies. Star formation occurs in dense cores and clumps of molecular gas and dust which can be probed with observations at radio- and infrared wavelengths. The study for nearby star formation and for more distant galactic massive clumps uses recent and new observations with the McDonald Observatory integral field unit, called VIRUS-P, the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory, and ALMA as well as archival data from Spitzer. This and results from large-scale surveys such as the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey will connect local studies of star formation to star formation in other galaxies on a large-scale. Observations of other galaxies show that the star formation rate is related to the overall gas surface density (Kennicutt-Schmidt relations) and these relations are important for models of galaxy formation and evolution. The work here will provide a better understanding of how large and small scale physics of star formation is linked.

This project provided new information on this process on scales ranging from whole galaxies to individual dense cores, the birthplaces of individual stars and planets. We found that the best predictor of how fast stars will form is the amount of relatively dense molecular gas. While all the gas in galaxies is amazingly tenuous compared to our atmosphere, for example, with averages of 1 particle per cubic centimeter, star formation is concentrated in regions where the density has increased to at least 10,000 particles per cubic centimeter. Another thing that is hard to determine is the timescale for star formation, since it is much longer than a human lifetime. By using a census technique, we were able to determine more accurately the time required to build a star out of a dense core, the name of the regions where the density has reached about 10,000 particles per cubic centimeter. Those who study star formation in other galaxies often rely on a relation between the star formation rate and the amount of molecular gas. We were able to show that this relation emerges from averaging over many regions, rather than being a fundamental relation that applies to each region.

28,"The proposal requests support for a one-day workshop to review and suggest improvements in the instrumentation used in the Surveys of Public Attitudes Toward and Understanding of Science and Technology. The workshop will bring together survey methodologists and substantive experts at NSF headquarters in Arlington, VA. The participants will consider the wording of questions, the structure of response scales, the meaning of terms used in the questions, and the range and overlap of the items in light of the concepts that they are designed to measure and the need for comparability and continuity of measurement. Participants at the workshop will include leading experts in questionnaire construction, cognitive approaches to survey design, psychometrics, and item response theory, along with substantive experts in measurement of scientific literacy. Scholars who have published leading work on measurement issues in science literacy will also be invited.

The results from the Surveys of Public Attitudes Toward and Understanding of Science and Technology have usually been included in the NSB's annual Science and Engineering Indicators, a report which goes directly to the White House and informs public debate about science education and public support of science in the United States. It is vital that the reported survey results be based on sound, tested survey questions that ask about the right issues and provide high-quality measurement of the key concepts that reveal public understanding of science--or the lack thereof. The workshop will review and improve key items on the survey and align these instruments more closely with the relevant concepts. These improvements will allow for a more revealing and more robust assessment of public understanding in future editions of the Science Indicators report and serve as a more reliable guide for future science policy in the United States.",NSF,4900,RECTOR & VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,P.O.

The results have appeared in Science and Engineering Indicators.  However, the 2010 edition of Science Indicators omitted the results from two true-false items because the National Science Board judged that they ""donÆt properly reflect what Americans know about science and, thus, are misleading.""

NSF arranged with Chris Toumey of the NanoCenter at the University of South Carolina, and Thomas Guterbock, Director of the Center for Survey Research at the University of Virginia to conduct two scientific workshops during Fall 2010 to evaluate the questions that the National Science Board has used over the years as indicators of public knowledge of science.  The first workshop (supported by a different grant) focused on the concept of adult science knowledge underlying the survey items, including the items that involve both scientific knowledge and religious conviction.  The second workshop, supported by this grant, examined the æinstrumentationÆ of the survey, that is, the measurement adequacy of the items themselves.

 In consultation with NSF Program Officers and staff, Guterbock brought together for the second workshop a group of survey methodologists and substantive experts, with the purpose of developing a set of specifications to identify the measurement qualities that would be desirable in the public science knowledge questions and outlining a protocol for creating additional questions and testing them.

The group met at NSFÆs Arlington headquarters on November 12, 2010. The workshop participants represented a wide range of expertise from the disciplines of sociology, communication, psychology, political science, and health policy and included survey researchers and methodologists. Some of the participants had been involved with the Science Engineering Indicators for many years. Others brought a fresh perspective stemming from their research on related topics.

 The workshop generated concrete ideas for better measurement of public knowledge and attitudes toward science and technology. One insight that was especially salient to the group was developed in the preceding, conceptual workshop.  Toumey and his colleagues emphasized that persons in the public have different reasons for acquiring scientific knowledge. Sometimes a person is in the role of acquiring information as a consumer. At other times, a person is acting in a civic role and needs scientific knowledge for decision-making about public matters. Finally, acquiring scientific knowledge is often pursued for sheer interest, enjoyment, or personal fulfillment. These three purposes have a direct impact on how to improve the measures of scientific knowledge.

 The November workshop generated a report that suggested ways of improving the questions that are asked in NSF""s surveys of public knowledge of science and technology.  In particular, the report made suggestions on how questions might be improved or made more informative to researchers, by distinguishing more clearly between knowledge of scientific theories and belief in those theories. 

 The work of this group has contributed to a continuing debate in the National Science Board and in the pages of Science about the most appropriate ways to measure public understanding of science and technology in the United States and in other countries. The proposed  ""Science in the Service of Citizens and Consumers"" Framework provides a new perspective essential to the development and improvement of items to measure public attitudes toward and understanding of science.

29,"How does the understanding of social networks contribute to social science?  In particular, (1) which network features or observable characteristics encode social structure; (2) how do these features contribute to the formation of connections or social ties; and (3) how does network structure impacts diffusion, specifically the spread of influences, opinions, and diseases?  A key difficulty in studying these questions is that most contributions to current understanding in this area come from a small number of applications where full network data are readily available.  Collecting complete network data is typically financially and practically impossible, while sampled network data are hard to collect and usually require special statistical modeling considerations.  In this project, latent space approaches will be applied to aggregated relational data (questions of the form, ""How many X?s do you know?"") collected using surveys on non-network samples.

The project's methods development and data analysis should make information about more complicated network structure available to the multitude of researchers who cannot in practice collect data from complete networks.  By analyzing existing data using this framework, the project will estimate aspects of social structure in personal acquaintances networks, variation of social structure across different sub-networks (family, friends, coworkers, etc), estimate homogeneity of groups, and estimate individual and population gregariousness, all of which could benefit social science researchers interested in understanding relationships between groups of individuals in the population.  The methods also are potentially useful for research on groups that are difficult to reach with traditional surveys, such as those with HIV/AIDS, the homeless, or injection drug users.  The project is supported by the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program and a consortium of federal statistical agencies as part of a joint activity to support research on survey and statistical methodology.",NSF,4900,"TRUSTEES OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK, THE",2960 Broadway,NEW YORK,US,New York,NY10,Columbia University,NY,100276902,47.075,['Andrew E Gelman'],08/31/2010,049179401,350000,08/31/2015,4900,"METHOD, MEASURE & STATS",350000,1023176,049179401,Tian  Zheng,2960 Broadway,NEW YORK,US,New York,NY10,Columbia University,NY,100276902,tzheng@stat.columbia.edu,Tian,Zheng,,2128512134,ceavey@nsf.gov,Cheryl L.

Such data aggregate respondents' social connections into answers towards survey questions of the form ""How many XÆs do you know."" These reported aggregated social relation counts capture information on social structure indirectly and take advantage of survey respondentsÆ social networks to reach members of traditionally hard-to-reach subpopulations while still being easily integrated into standard surveys. 

On the methology front, during the course of this project, we developed a collection of latent space approaches and a Bayesian computation framework for inference and estimation of social structures using such data, including the level of clustering of social networks and its variation in subnetworks, and the relations between (hard-to-reach) subpopulations, which is otherwise hard to study using direct network studies. Our research provides a quick and easy-to-adopt way of studying social structure. We have published our research in major statistical journals. We have also explored various computational techniques to accelerate our software so that it can be made more streamlined for social scientists.
On the application front, in collaboration with Prof. Yotam Margalit of the political science department at Columbia, we have placed a set of questions about social networks on the YouGov survey, with the goal of learning about ""penumbras."" The penumbra is the group of people who are close, in a social network sense, to some group of interest. Using the results from this survey we will attempt to learn the sizes of various penumbras and to correlate penumbra membership with political attitudes. In collaboration with Dr. Sarah Cowan of the Sociology department of NYU and a Robert Wood Johnson Health and Society Scholar at Columbia University, we are designing a survey study that targets to estimate ""penumbras"" of different types of cancer and different channels and rate of communicating their diagnosis for patients of different cancers. 
The research of this project had provided our graduate students research experience on Bayesian modeling and computation, survey design and social network analysis. To our statistics students, they were exposed to current and important research problems in social sciences. And these projects provided our political science students exceptional exposure to modern statistical modeling and computational tools.

The Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment

The solution to the problem of dark energy will require a fundamental shift in our understanding of the Universe, and acceptance of any model will require significant corroboration by observations.  The Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) Dark Energy Experiment, HETDEX, offers a technically clean and observationally robust approach to measuring the effects of dark energy.  HETDEX includes an upgrade of the HET for a wider field of view, deployment of the Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS), and completion of a wide field survey which will use 1400 hours of observation to obtain nearly a million redshifts of Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies.  Significant parts of the project are already underway with support from a variety of sources, including substantial private donations.

The survey will determine the local Hubble expansion at redshift 2.4 and measure the angular diameter distance out to that redshift, both to an accuracy of 0.8%, and determine the growth of structure to 2%.  Nearly all other dark energy surveys target lower redshifts, while HETDEX was designed to provide high-redshift information on the evolution of dark energy, as well as being sufficiently powerful to measure dark energy effects even at late times.  HETDEX further will measure the curvature of the Universe to about 0.1%, an order of magnitude better than current projects, and a strong complement to other current and planned studies.  Although HETDEX is optimized for measures of the expansion history, there is significant ancillary science from the survey, such as a collection of spectra of a quarter of a million stars and 1.4 million other galaxies.  Given its capabilities, VIRUS will remain a, if not the, primary instrument for HET for many years.

The significant insights on dark energy, the large database with substantial ancillary science, and the unique and powerful integral field spectrograph on the HET will have a broad impact throughout the astronomical community.  The attraction of the dark energy enigma enables HETDEX to include significant public outreach involving the McDonald Observatory Visitors Center and Stardate radio, including an interactive display for visitors and the involvement of K-12 teachers, as well as a popular webpage at http://www.hetdex.org.",NSF,4900,"PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY, THE",110 Technology Center Building,UNIVERSITY PARK,US,University Park,PA05,Pennsylvania State Univ University Park,PA,168027000,47.049,"['Robin B Ciardullo', 'Caryl A Gronwall']",08/25/2010,003403953,500971,08/31/2015,4900,MID-SCALE INSTRUMENTATION,523471,0926641,003403953,Donald P Schneider,110 Technology Center Building,UNIVERSITY PARK,US,University Park,PA05,Pennsylvania State Univ University Park,PA,168027000,dps7@psu.edu,Donald,Schneider,P,8148639554,nsharp@nsf.gov,Nigel Sharp,7032924905,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The three year Hobby Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) will look 10 billion years back in time, identify close to a million of the epoch's star-forming galaxies (specifically, Ly&alpha; emitting objects), and use the distribution of these galaxies to measure the evolution of the mysterious Dark Energy component to the universe.  To prepare for this survey, we have conducted a number of studies of the galaxies of the epoch, measuring their stellar masses, star formation rates, sizes, chemical abundances, emission-line strengths, escape probability of Ly&alpha; photons, and dust properties.  These data, which have directly informed the HETDEX observing strategy, have resulted in over two dozen refereed publications (with a half-dozen more currently in the refereeing process).  Major results include the discovery that Ly&alpha; emitters are not special low-mass systems in the act formation, but are instead representative of (almost) the entire population of distant, star-forming galaxies.  We have also shown that the dust obscuration law which affects the observed properties of these star-forming galaxies depends on the galaxy's mass, and the fraction of Ly&alpha; photons which escape the distant universe is only 4.4%.

One limitation of the HETDEX survey is that, in the absense of additional information, foreground galaxies may be confused with the distant objects targeted in the survey.  Thus, another goal of the project was to conduct a deep imaging survey of the HETDEX field, and to the develop the procedures needed to use these data to discriminate the Ly&alpha; emitters from foreground contaminants. During the course of this program, we have imaged enough of the HETDEX region to carry us through the first two years of the survey, we have measured the distribution of galaxies properties needed to perform this discrimination, and we have proto-typed the requisite software.

Finally, in performing this project, we have trained one postdoctoral researcher, four graduate students, and five undergraduates.  Three of these students are women, which are under represented in physics and astronomy.  All of the project participants have been active in outreach events, including Astro Fest, which attracts over 2000 visitors per year, Astro Night, which involves another 300 visitors, and our department's astronomy open houses.  The investigators of this project have also given a number of public lectures on the galaxies of the distant universe and HETDEX.

Funding of this project will permit establishment of a partnership between US astronomers and LAMOST.

As a result of this collaboration, 16 Chinese scholars traveled to the US to work with US astronomers on Milky Way science, and US astronomers contributed to the design of the LAMOST spectroscopic survey of Milky Way stars.  Nine US astronomers were granted the same rights to use data from the LAMOST spectroscopic survey as our Chinese colleagues enjoy, based on their technical and scientific contributions to the Chinese survey.  The head of this project (Heidi Jo Newberg) was named as the head of the Key Project to map the substructure of the Milky Way stellar halo; the substructure is formed by small galaxies falling into the Milky Way and being ripped apart by the Milky Way gravity so that the small galaxies' stars are pulled out into long streams and are then incorporated into our galaxy.

At the completion of this project, a total of 5,755,126 spectra,  of which 3,177,995 are spectra of Milky Way stars with sufficient quality to measure the properties of the stars, are available to the collaboration in Data Release 3 (DR3). In addition, preliminary versions of the data from an additional half year of observing are available, bringing  the total number of spectra to 6,988,109 (3,914,349 quality spectra of stars). Many of these are repeated observations of the same  object, so that of the total of ~3.9 million spectra of stars, a total of  roughly 3.1 million individual stars have been observed.

This project introduced 14 undergraduate students to astronomy research for the first time.  Many of these students have gone on to successful graduate school careers; some went directly to STEM employment and others are still undergraduate students.  It also partially supported two high school research projects.  One of the high school students was named a finalist in the Intel Science Talent Search 2013 and is now studying astronomy in college.

The grant contributed to the publication of 36 research papers published in refereed journals.  These papers described the Chinese LAMOST survey, measured the properties of the stars in the Milky Way's disk and in star streams in the halo, cataloged unusual stars in our galaxy, and developed techniques for better astronomical calibrations.  Below we describe the results four noteworthy papers from this list.

The paper ""LAMOST Experiment for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (LEGUE) &mdash; The survey's science plan"" by Deng et al. (2012) described the data that was taken with the Guoshoujing Telescope.  It was co-authored by the members of the US and Chinese collaboration, and it won the RAA Excellent Paper Award as one of the most highly cited papers in 2015.

The paper ""Substructure in Bulk Velocities of Milky Way Disk Stars,"" by Carlin et al. (2013) used LAMOST spectroscopic survey data to show that there is previously unknown substructure in the velocities of stars in the Milky Way disk.  In particular the stars in our local neighborhood appear to be moving closer to each other (a compression wave), showing that the structure of the disk is not a simple as previously though, and changes with time.  The first author, Jeff Carlin, is a postdoctoral researcher supported completely by this grant.

The paper ""Rings and Radial Waves in the Disk of the Milky Way,"" by Xu et al. (2015), showed that the plane of the Milky Way disk is not flat as previously thought, but is instead rippled like a corrugated roof.  This ripple is believed to be caused by the gravitational force of small galaxies in orbit around our galaxy making wavelike patterns in the disk.  This dynamic process could be related to the creation of spiral structure in galaxies.  This result was listed #59 on Discovery Magazine's list of the top 100 science stories from 2015.  The first author was a Chinese visiting scholar working under Prof. Newberg at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

The paper ""The First Hypervelocity Star from the LAMOST Survey,"" by Zheng et al. (2014) identifies a Milky Way star moving at a speed of over a million miles per hour.  These very fast stars might tell us about the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, or help map the mysterious dark matter thought to surround our galaxy.  The first author of this paper is Prof. Zheng from the University of Utah.  The publication of this result also attracted the attention of the worldwide press.

32,"This team will extend their DEEP2 spectroscopic survey, using high dispersion spectra with the DEIMOS multi-object spectrograph at the Keck telescopes for galaxies in the redshift range 0.5 < z < 1.5.  This redshift range represents 85% of cosmic history, over the time when most of the galaxy mass was assembled and galaxies formed their disks.  The new DEEP3 survey concentrates on the extended Groth strip, an area on the sky that has been observed with many of NASA's great observatories.  The team will use these and other archives to compile a panchromatic catalog describing their survey galaxies over a wide wavelength range from radio to X-rays.  DEEP3 will push the limit of observations 2.5 times fainter than DEEP2, tripling the number of measured galaxies.

The team will estimate the rate at which their survey galaxies are forming their stars, by measuring their brightness in the ultraviolet, infrared and radio, and by using diagnostics based on the optical emission lines measured in the DEEP2 and DEEP3 surveys.  They will investigate a tight relation found in DEEP2 between the rate of star formation in a galaxy and the mass in stars already present, and examine how galaxy environment and morphology affect that relation.  Team members will use observations from the DEEP2 and DEEP3 surveys to study how scaling laws such as the Tully-Fisher relation (between a galaxy's luminosity and its circular rotation speed) change over time as disk galaxies are assembled.  They will investigate the role of active galactic nuclei in star formation, and use X-ray observations to search for signs of faint hidden active nuclei.  

Graduate students and postdoctoral scholars will be trained as they participate in the research.  As has been done for the earlier DEEP2 survey, data including redshifts, photometry, and spectra would be released to the astronomical community.

Modern theory says that galaxies began as infinitesimal quantum fluctuations in the fabric of space-time just after the Big Bang.  Positive fluctuations acted as gravitational ""seeds"" that drew in surrounding matter and grew over billions of years to become the enormous galaxies of today.

In detail, galactic birth was more complex, involving two different kinds of matter, ""dark"" and gaseous, that collapsed inwards in an intimate gravitational embrace. The gaseous portion condensed to form visible stars and planets, while dark matter (comprising 5/6 of the total mass) tended to be left behind, forming, a vast, invisible outer halo.

What we did and why: DEEP3 aimed to flesh out the above picture by gathering some of the world?s richest data on thousands of very faint galaxies and using the world?s finest instruments on Keck and other telescopes to peer back in time some 5-10 billion years to observe galaxies growing in situ.   We focused on two key questions:

1)   Why some distant young galaxies became actively star-forming disky spirals like our own Milky Way, whereas others became quiescent, non-star-forming, football-shaped elliptical galaxies; and

2)   How super-massive black holes grew at the centers of galaxies &ndash; up to a billion or more times our Sun in mass &ndash; and how they assisted, if they did, in transforming spirals to ellipticals.

The DEEP3 survey was followed up by head-to-head quantitative comparisons of our data to the world?s most advanced computer simulations of galaxies and their dark-matter halos. We also publicly released some of the first, largest, and most information-rich databases of distant galaxies for use by other astronomers world-wide.

Scientific Highlights of DEEP3: 

Confirmation of the rule that star-formation activity increases with a galaxy?s stellar mass. The relationship is tight, applies over most of the age of the Universe, and is referred to in the astronomical community by the name we gave it, the ""star-forming main sequence"".  
Discovery of the rule that when a galaxy's central density of stars reaches a high-enough (critical) value, star formation activity over the entire galaxy starts to fall. Prior to this, astronomers had found that a galaxy?s overall mass or density appeared most closely related to star-formation shutdown &ndash; we showed instead that central density is much more diagnostic.  Our new focus on galaxy centers prompts the question whether a central, massive black hole, growing in concert with the stars, is heating and disrupting the surrounding gas and cutting off star formation throughout the entire galaxy.
Discovery that galaxies, when corrected for their age and stellar mass, all take the same path from high to low star forming activity.  A few traversed this path quickly on a ""fast track"" at early times, while many more took a ""slow track"" and are quenching only now.  
Evidence that mergers of similar-sized galaxies &ndash; for years the dominant paradigm for explaining many galaxy evolutionary trends &ndash; in fact play only a minor role in the lives of most galaxies, even galaxies that appear to host actively-growing super-massive black holes (AGN). 
Discovery that galaxies settle from a chaotic early phase to disks in ordered circular rotation like our Milky Way, and that massive disks settle sooner (at earlier epochs) than their lower-mass cousins.  
Discovery of a possible new rule that galaxies make stars in direct proportion to the number of existing stars at each radius. This appears to contradict two other popular rules: that galaxies form new stars preferentially in their outer parts and that star-formation ends first in the center, dropping later in the outer parts.  This new rule needs to be checked with future research. 
All of the above discoveries are remarkably consistent with the predicted properties of dark-matter halos or the behavior of gas as it falls into halos, as modeled by state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy evolution.  


In summary, the overall findings from this project are that galaxies evolve smoothly and predictably and that our understanding of how and why this happens is falling into place.

Broader impacts:

&bull; Completed the largest distant galaxy spectroscopic redshift survey to date (DEEP2/3) and made it public.

&bull; Used DEEP2/3 as a magnet to attract further multi-energy observations from X-rays to radio.  The region of sky used for DEEP3 became one of Hubble?s five legacy fields for distant galaxy research (the CANDELS project).

&bull; Created a convenient public user interface (RAINBOW Navigator) for downloading all multi-wavelength images, spectra, and value-added catalogs from CANDELS. 

&bull; Delivered many public talks outlining our research, how it tells the story of humanity?s cosmic roots and predicts its cosmic future, and argued for the centrality of astronomical knowledge in shaping the future of our planet and the human race.

33,"When two or more categorical variables are measured, questions naturally arise regarding the associations among them.  Well-established methods, such as Pearson chi-square tests for independence and loglinear models, have been developed to assess the association structure between ""single-response"" categorical variables.  When one of these categorical variables arises from a survey question which asks respondents to ""choose all that apply,"" the analysis is not as straightforward because survey respondents may respond positively to more than one item from the list and the responses are likely to be correlated, creating a ""multiple-response"" categorical variable.  Furthermore, when the survey data arises from a complex survey design, there currently are no statistical analysis methods available to analyze association structures involving multiple-response categorical variables.  This research project will develop a new set of statistical analysis procedures for testing and estimating associations and modeling multiple-response categorical variables arising through complex survey sampling.  The research will build upon recently developed methods for multiple-response categorical variables in the simple random sample case.  Rao-Scott adjustments, common in the analysis of associations among ordinary single-response categorical variables from complex survey sampling, will be extended to develop Pearson-type tests of associations involving multiple-response categorical variables.  Odds-ratio-based measures of association and corresponding linearization-based standard errors will be derived to measure level of association.  Marginal generalized loglinear models will be developed that allow the association structure to be described in terms of main effects and interactions due to the factors represented by the multiple-response categorical variables.  Model-based tests for goodness-of-fit and estimates of odds ratios will be developed using asymptotic techniques.  Adequacy of all methods developed will be examined by means of simulation.

Society is inundated with surveys, many of which include questions that invite respondents to ""choose all that apply"" from a series of items.  This research will provide survey analysts with an essential set of statistical analysis tools for analyzing data from questions of this type, for which there currently is no good alternative.  It also will lay the groundwork for future research including extensions to more varied data structures and the handling of missing data.  Because surveys are such an integral part of our society's information-gathering and exchange system, the impact can be expected to be far-reaching, affecting areas such as public health, political science, criminology, sociology, demography, business, and technology.

34,"Every request to take part in a survey is framed in some way.  This project consists of a set of experiments that investigate how the presentation of the survey request affects nonresponse and measurement error.  The experiments are guided by a theory of survey participation (the salience-leverage theory) that claims that people decide whether to take part in a survey based on whatever aspects of the survey are made salient in the presentation of the survey request and on how they evaluate those features.  Two initial experiments randomly vary the description of the topic and sponsor of the survey, with hypothesized effects both on nonresponse propensities and on reporting.  In the third experiment, survey design features that can mediate or reduce the error-producing influences of the survey topic and sponsor will be examined.  Thus, the project experimentally tests mechanisms producing nonresponse bias and measurement errors and, once these effects have been documented, provides guidance to the survey practitioner about how to reduce their impact.

While the research is theoretically motivated and features experimental control, there are important practical implications of the work for the federal statistical agencies and the larger survey community.  Sometimes estimates of key social indicators (e.g., the prevalence of rape or the frequency of defensive use of handguns) vary widely across surveys.  The effects explored in this project may help explain these discrepancies.  In addition, this work will a) help agencies conducting surveys anticipate when different sponsors may obtain different results, b) provide evidence about potentially harmful effects on nonresponse error and measurement error of emphasizing a single purpose of a survey, and c) produce evidence regarding design features that can reduce the effects of the presentation of the survey on nonresponse and measurement error.",NSF,4900,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,3003 South State St. Room 1062,Ann Arbor,US,Ann Arbor,MI12,University of Michigan Ann Arbor,MI,481091274,47.075,['Robert M Groves'],04/07/2006,073133571,,04/30/2012,4900,"METHOD, MEASURE & STATS",528731,0550385,073133571,Roger  Tourangeau,3003 South State St. Room 1062,Ann Arbor,US,Ann Arbor,MI12,University of Michigan Ann Arbor,MI,481091274,RogerTourangeau@Westat.com,Roger,Tourangeau,,3012942828,ceavey@nsf.gov,Cheryl L.

Model-based tests for goodness-of-fit and estimates of odds ratios will be developed using asymptotic techniques.  Adequacy of all methods developed will be examined by means of simulation.

Society is inundated with surveys, many of which include questions that invite respondents to ""choose all that apply"" from a series of items.  This research will provide survey analysts with an essential set of statistical analysis tools for analyzing data from questions of this type, for which there currently is no good alternative.  It also will lay the groundwork for future research including extensions to more varied data structures and the handling of missing data.  Because surveys are such an integral part of our society's information-gathering and exchange system, the impact can be expected to be far-reaching, affecting areas such as public health, political science, criminology, sociology, demography, business, and technology.  Any institution that uses statistically-designed surveys and includes ""choose all that apply"" questions stands to benefit from the tools provided by this research.

37,"The Tuskegee University HBCU-UP Broadening Participation Research in STEM Education project is entitled Fostering Retention in STEM Disciplines at Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The proposed study will examine the interplay between psychosocial and academic structural factors that affect retention of minority students at HBCUs. The objectives are to (1) determine the most prominent psycho-social factors that affect student retention in STEM programs; (2) identify the structural factors that lead to the successful retention of students in STEM programs; (3) gain insight into the issues that influence the effectiveness of those structural factors; and (4) develop  a manual describing suggestions for best practices.

The proposal frames the study by presenting a synthesis of the literature in a model of psychological and sociological influences on STEM retention at HBCUs. The PIs intend to build upon this model to describe what HBCUs are doing to foster student success. The study will employ a mixed methods approach to collect and analyze data from students, faculty, administrators and other non-faculty personnel, and successful graduates of STEM programs from HBCUs in order to investigate three research questions:
1. What psycho-social factors (emotional, motivational, and social factors) appear to affect the retention of students in STEM disciplines at HBCUs? In what ways are these effects manifested?
2. How do structural factors (tangible resources, availability of mentors, supportive programs, etc.) influence retention rates in STEM disciplines at HBCUs?
3. What influence, if any, do psycho-social factors (emotional factors, motivational factors, social factors) appear to have on the effectiveness of structural factors which are intended to support student retention in STEM disciplines?

 The study will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of faculty specializing in education, social and behavioral sciences, and mathematics, and it will be conducted in collaboration with other HBCUs.  Through the use of a community-based participatory research methodology, the PIs expect to produce results that will have practical benefits to the larger community. More specifically, the study may provide guidance that will translate into a set of best practices for HBCUs and non-HBCUs seeking to increase minority student retention in STEM, particularly at the freshman and sophomore levels.",NSF,4900,TUSKEGEE UNIVERSITY,1200 W Montgomery Road,Tuskegee Institute,US,Tuskegee Institute,AL03,Tuskegee University,AL,360881923,47.076,"['Mohammed A Qazi', 'Chadia  Affane Aji', 'Melvin  Gadson', 'Lauretta E Garrett']",09/08/2012,128214178,349992,08/31/2016,4900,HIST BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIV,349992,1238786,128214178,Vivian  Carter,Dept Of Mathematics,Tuskegee,US,Tuskegee Institute,AL03,Tuskegee University,AL,360882300,vlcarter@mytu.tuskegee.edu,Vivian,Carter,,3347278501,crankins@nsf.gov,Claudia M.

What was done by who

The study examines the impact of psychological (emotional and motivational) and sociological factors on students? retention in?science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The study was led by a diverse team of STEM researchers from psychology, sociology, education and mathematics.? In addition the study recruited liaison from 5 HBCUs (Charles Drew University of Medicine and Science, Howard University, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical University, Texas Southern University, and Winston Salem State University) to assist in recruiting participants and disseminating results. The study was guided by a rigorous methodology that utilized community based participatory research and survey methods to produce valid and reliable quantitative and qualitative data.
What did the project produce

A major product of this study is the construction of a multidimensional comprehensive survey instrument designed to address multiple factors in STEM retention at HBCUs. The survey design and questions relied heavily upon input from focus groups with students, alumni, staff, faculty and administrator through highly structured focus group sessions at the 6 participation HBCUs representing geographic regions from across the country.? This is an important development since research instruments do not always address the needs and experiences of underserved populations.?? In addition, a model was constructed and revised to demonstrate the relational patterns associated with STEM retention that can not only be applied to HBCUs but also other minority serving institutions and predominantly white institutions as well.?

 

The study also provided two very powerful workshops.? The Liaison Workshop provided liaisons with a handbook summarizing preliminary research results and giving an overview of some of the best practices for retention of minority students.? The second workshop, Liaison Writing Retreat, gave liaisons the opportunity to contribute to a manuscript on best practices from the vantage point of HBCU students, alumni, faculty, staff, and administrators. ?The liaisons affiliated with this study are more knowledgeable about key factors influencing retention in STEM fields and will incorporate that understanding into their professional and instructional portfolios.
Broader Impacts

The impact of this study reaches far beyond the scope of the proposal.? The study?s multidisciplinary approach has influenced research collaborations within the participating institutions such as Howard University?s successful research collaboration between Social Work and Biology.? The study has also been a training ground for Tuskegee Co-PIs and provided the foundational framework for a continuation grant proposal which was funded by NSF this fall.

 

The model developed by the research team helped to guide the study through the implementation of research focus group and survey question development. A study of existing research regarding psychological, sociological, and structural factors guided the initial creation of a theoretical model which was then edited to reflect ideas that emerged from focus group data. The study gathered qualitative data through focus group discussion with students, alumni, staff, faculty and administrators to provide a rich source of firsthand accounts of the STEM experience. The focus groups allowed stakeholders engaged in the instructional development of STEM professionals at HBCUs to share multiple perspectives. The workshop, workshop manual developed by the study, and dissemination presentations at conferences and to institutional stakeholders have provided meaningful data to partner institutions as well as other HBCUs from across the country. The expected shift in demographics in the next forty years will require American institutions of higher education to serve an increasingly diverse student populations in order for America to compete in the world?s global economy, and this work will help HBCUs and other institutions better serve that diverse population.

As previously noted, both the model and construction of a reliable survey instrument have been added to the tools that can be used to conduct STEM retention research.?Statistical tests show that the survey instrument is valid and reliable for research purposes. Results from the survey instrument show that emotional factors (self-reliance, confidence in study habits, financial concerns, and ability to cope with stress) and structural factors (people, programs, resources, and institutional standards) are significant predictors as to why students remain in their STEM fields of study.? In addition, the study serves as a guide for providing better service to students and increasing retention.

 

Another important impact of this study has been the opportunity to work with and train undergraduate research assistants. These students have contributed substantially to our discussion and research processes and as such have been part of the STEM community participation in the project. They have gained valuable research experience that will allow them to go forward and contribute greatly to the desired and much needed increased diversity in the STEM workforce.?

Systematic methods are needed to quantify uncertainty in nanomanufacturing processes, and subsequently to design processes that are robust to these uncertainties. Nanoscale phenomena present a new challenge for manufacturing, due to the inherent stochastic dynamics, in addition to sensitivities to macroscopic process inputs like temperature and pressure. However, processes are currently being developed to take advantage of the new discoveries and advancements in nanoscience, and cost-effective engineering approaches and tools are needed to more efficiently explore the design space to develop nanotechnology-enabled products. In this work the PIs focus on the synthesis of metal nanoparticles, which are used in a wide range of applications from energy to medicine. For example, nanoparticles of controlled size and size distribution are needed to create high performance catalysts for NOx treatment in diesel engines, which produce lower CO2 emissions relative to gasoline engines.  However, developing a high-throughput manufacturing process to create durable supported catalysts in a cost-effective manner has been elusive, in part due to design tradeoffs like higher performance but lower durability at smaller nanoparticle size. Moreover, significant variability exists both within a single batch of nanoparticles, due to the inherent distribution of particle nucleation times, and also between batches, due to drift in operating conditions and noise variables.

This project is a comprehensive methodology for robust optimization of a batch process, using various sources of information integrated by a rigorous Bayesian method. First, mechanistic models of mean process behaviors, as is common in the engineering disciplines, will be developed. Since models of nanoscale phenomena are typically not accurate within manufacturing tolerances, mechanistic models will be supplemented with stochastic components linking within- and between-batch variations to controllable process parameters and noise variables for robust process design. Expert opinions help model trends and expected variance for upgrading the models into a stochastic-mechanistic simulation tool. The simulated data generated will be used to build a statistical-mechanistic model, which is less complex than the simulation model, suitable for efficient exploration of process recipes. Then, physical data will be collected based on optimal experimental design plans developed to validate and improve the statistical-mechanistic model. Finally, the refined model will be used to cost-effectively search for the optimized process recipe, to achieve the desired nanoparticle size with a narrow size distribution while minimizing batch-to-batch variation.

Intellectual merit.  The current disconnect between the fields of robust design in statistics and mechanistic modeling in engineering will be bridged by this methodology. Incorporating all sources of information on mean behavior and variance requires domain-specific knowledge and mechanistic understanding. This modeling approach for mean and variance of process variables is required to derive the recipe for a robust optimal process.

Broader impact.  The PI team is uniquely equipped to develop this new methodology for robust process optimization. They combine expertise in experiments, mechanistic modeling, process control, and experimental design, along with our close collaborations with industry. The diverse team of faculty and students (graduate, undergraduate, and high school) who will participate in the project will gain experience and insight that will allow them to work in interdisciplinary nanomanufacturing environments.",NSF,4900,GEORGIA TECH RESEARCH CORPORATION,Office of Sponsored Programs,Atlanta,US,Atlanta,GA05,Georgia Tech Research Corporation,GA,303320420,47.041,"['Dennis W Hess', 'Jye-Chyi  Lu']",07/28/2009,097394084,400000,08/31/2013,4900,PROCESS & REACTION ENGINEERING,415011,0933430,097394084,Martha A Grover,225 NORTH AVE NW,Atlanta,US,Atlanta,GA05,Georgia Institute of Technology,GA,303320002,martha.grover@chbe.gatech.edu,Martha,Grover,A,4048942878,mburka@nsf.gov,Maria Burka,7032927030,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Designing a process for a new advanced technology is challenging, because the process is not well understood yet and performing experiments is often costly&ndash;in time and money.  The engineer initially performs a set of experiments to learn about the process, and then the engineer uses the knowledge gained to perform additional experiments, now at modified conditions that should yield a more economical process. 

This research program focused on high-pressure nanoparticle deposition processes.  New statistical methods were developed in the context of this application to design efficient experiments, guiding the engineer toward the best processing conditions with a minimum number of experiments.  The new methods for experimental design treat two distinct scenarios.  The first is the case when no experiments have been performed yet.  In this case, expert knowledge can still be used to design the first batch of experiments, bringing in hypotheses as well as past data on similar systems.  In the second case, an initial set of experimental data is already available, and the goal is to design new batches of experiments sequentially, each time learning from the past data to zoom in on the optimal process conditions. 

In nanoparticle deposition, the process conditions include temperature, pressure, concentrations of multiple compounds, and the type of wafer and its surface treatment.  The goal is to achieve a desired nanoparticle size distribution, tailored to the desired application.  Two different material systems and applications were studied in this project: silver nanoparticles for chemical sensing, and copper-zinc-tin-sulfide nanoparticles and films for solar energy applications.  In both cases, carbon dioxide at high pressure was used to enable high fluid concentration of the deposition species.  The carbon dioxide also replaces organic solvents that are environmentally unfriendly.  This type of high-pressure process has not been heavily studied in the past, and the chemical mechanisms are not well understood, so it is a good case study for our experimental design methods for advanced technology.

The new experimental design methods for initial experimental design were implemented in experiment, taking past information from the silver nanoparticle deposition process.  Four experts in the field were surveyed, giving predictions on iridium nanoparticle deposition for an otherwise similar process.  A unified statistical model was constructed based on the survey data, and this was used to design a set of six experiments.  The experiments had various temperatures, with the goal of finding the temperature to achieve an iridium nanoparticle size of 40 nm.  The method did perform as intended, clustering experiments near the desired iridium nanoparticle size.  However, an unexpected new phase also appeared: larger structures composed of smaller particles.  The appearance of a new structure was not addressed by the survey questions, and highlighted the importance of survey design in this approach.

The method for sequential experimental design was demonstrated using the silver nanoparticle process.  Based on an initial set of six experiments, multiple models were fit to the data to describe the relationship between temperature and mean nanoparticle size.  A second batch of six experiments was designed, balancing the need to spread out experiments with the need to cluster them near the desired nanoparticle size of 40 nm.  This batch of experiments did span the desired nanoparticle size, but did not predict the size within the desired level of confidence, 5 nm.  Thus, a third batch of six experiments was designed, further focused around the target size, and after this data was collected, the mean size was predicted with the desired level of confidence.

39,"To assess the total value, including use and nonuse values, of nonmarket goods such as environmental amenities, researchers often apply survey techniques that allow them to explore public preferences for hypothetical goods or services. Until recently, the standard survey technique for this purpose has been the contingent valuation (CV) method. Recently, a similar but more complex technique, conjoint analysis, has been used in several environmental contexts. Conjoint analysis is a marketing technique that can be used to assess values for attributes of market or nonmarket goods based on survey respondents' willingness to trade-off different bundles of these attributes. In a conjoint analysis survey, respondents are presented with a set of scenarios that differ in terms of a series of attributes and are asked to rank the alternative scenarios, or choose their most preferred. The scenarios in the choice set differ by the levels of the different attributes.  A major cost consideration in conducting surveys for environmental valuation is the per-unit cost of survey administration. At current costs, sample sizes are often limited to the smallest researchers feel is necessary for a particular problem. By employing optimal survey design techniques, practitioners can increase the informational content of each observation, producing the equivalent effect of a larger sample size.  The goal of this research is to determine optimal attribute levels and choice sets for conjoint analysis questions that, given a fixed number of observations, will provide the most information possible about parameter estimators of interest, such as mean or median willingness to pay. This research will extend the existing literature on the optimal design of conjoint analysis surveys in two ways:  it will consider attribute levels as well as choice sets as variables in the optimization problem and it will derive `optimal` designs as opposed to ''efficient.'' The methods to be used in deriving the design results are optimization algorithms, principally, a search routine that searches over all choice set combinations to derive optimal choice sets and an analytical optimization algorithm to derive optimal attribute levels.",NSF,4900,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,200 OAK ST SE,Minneapolis,US,Minneapolis,MN05,University of Minnesota-Twin Cities,MN,554552070,47.075,,09/06/1996,555917996,82563,12/31/1999,4900,DECISION RISK & MANAGEMENT SCI,82563,9613045,006220594,Barbara J Kanninen,200 OAK ST SE,Minneapolis,US,Minneapolis,MN05,University of Minnesota-Twin Cities,MN,554552070,barbkann@aol.com,Barbara,Kanninen,J,7035366949,@nsf.gov,,,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,,09/01/1996,Optimal Experimental Design for Conjoint Analysis,Grant
40,"The system of stable and consensual democracy in Britain is fraying at the edges. Anti-establishment populist political movements are on the rise, the traditional bases of party support have shifted, the public is deeply divided on many issues, most visibly Brexit, and Scotland is threatening a second independence referendum. However, these kinds of startling developments in political behavior and party system structure are not unique to Britain. Rather, they seem to be symptomatic of changes in many other established western democracies. This project proposes a study of British voters in the June 8, 2017 general election.  That enterprise is an interesting topic in its own right. It also provides an opportunity to compare voting behavior in one country with that in seven other western democracies. The project is a part of the larger Comparative National Election Project (CNEP), which consists of surveys on recent national elections in the United States, France, and four Southern European countries, along with an upcoming 2017 post-election survey in Germany. The CNEP's common core survey design allows for systematic comparison across the eight cases. The CNEP survey in Great Britain will produce significant impacts by leveraging data collection from seven other western democracies, and through a collaborative network of country and cross-national election experts.  The project holds the potential to shed insights on factors that can help strengthen democracy, encourage citizen participation and engagement, improve political communication, and address negative consequences resulting from political polarization. The team will disseminate data and findings widely.  The investigators plan to publicize their findings to the public via media interviews, university publicity, essays on such platforms such as The Conversation and the Washington Post's Monkey Cage blog, white papers, and community talks. 

A survey of voters in the British general election on June 8, 2017 provides the opportunity for theoretically-driven comparative research examining contemporary voting behavior in the four largest (or core) western democracies: the United States, France, Germany, and Great Britain, all of which have held national elections within the a year of each other. Parallel surveys of the 2016 presidential election in the United States and the May 7 second-round French presidential election have been completed, and a parallel survey of the September federal legislative elections in Germany is in the works. These studies all utilize the common core questionnaire that has been at the center of 49 post-election surveys in 27 countries over the past three decades under the auspices of the Comparative National Elections Project (CNEP). Use of a common questionnaire and the availability of four CNEP surveys of elections recently held in southern Europe greatly facilitates comparative analysis. The strength of the proposed project is the systematic comparative analysis it allows of voting behavior across these eight western democracies, at least three of which have undergone substantial party-system realignment in recent years. Additional analytical insights concerning certain core CNEP concerns, such as attitudes toward democracy, will be gained by selective comparative analysis of these eight political systems with several semi-democratic countries (e.g. Turkey) that have been surveyed in the last three years using the core CNEP questionnaire. The primary aim of the research is to seek to explain the fundamental challenges to established patterns of voting behavior and the structure of party systems that emerged in recent years. The team does so focusing on factors such as responses to economic stress, changing patterns of political intermediation, demand for and satisfaction with democracy, and political polarization. Beyond enabling analysis of British voters in 2017, the CNEP British survey will have a strong multiplier effect by leveraging data collection from the 3 core western democracies and 4 southern Europe countries, as well as by drawing upon a network of country and cross-national election experts. The outcomes are expected to include a volume charting new patterns of electoral politics in core western democracies and southern Europe, papers and peer-reviewed publications analyzing the major underlying factors impacting stability and change in party support in the core western democratic countries and the public release of the British dataset after an embargo period.",NSF,4900,"OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, THE",Office of Sponsored Programs,Columbus,US,Columbus,OH03,Ohio State University,OH,432101016,47.075,"['Paul A Beck', 'Richard  Gunther', 'Anthony  Mughan']",07/13/2017,832127323,54188,06/30/2018,4900,POLITICAL SCIENCE,54188,1744626,001964634,Erik C Nisbet,,,US,Columbus,OH03,Ohio State University,OH,432101016,nisbet.5@osu.edu,Erik,Nisbet,C,6142471693,bhumes@nsf.gov,Brian D.

41,"Poverty reduction is one of the central challenges for development in new democracies. Many of these democracies operate in a context of weak institutions, where policy implementation is subject to the discretion of politicians, This proposal investigates the strategies used to target private benefits and how voters' access to benefits affects their behavior. This project studies the conditions under which local politicians pursue partisan targeting strategies and when voters can circumvent these strategies. 

This project consists of three components that combine quantitative and qualitative methods, including a dataset that compiles information on the number of families identified as poor by the government, the number of families issued benefits, the partisan composition of local governments and the state assembly units. These data are used to assess whether the number of households given access to anti-poverty programs across local government units is determined by political characteristics. The second component is a survey of voters and local politicians. These data are used to test individual-level hypotheses on partisan targeting bias, voter-intermediary strategies used to access benefits, and the ability of politicians to monitor votes across partisan contexts. Finally, focus group will be conducted to illuminate mechanisms found in the quantitative results. This research aims to provide a micro-level understanding of party-voter linkages and partisan strategies of clientelistic distribution that is applicable to a diverse range of democratic settings in the developing world.

The goal of this project is to identify the causes and consequences of party capture of anti-poverty programs, a problem that threatens efforts to alleviate poverty in many developing democracies. In addition to improving scholarly understanding of clientelistic strategies in a democratic context, the results will also be useful to the development and policy communities who are focused on improving the efficiency of these programs.

This survey provides unique data that allows me to test claims on the level of information local elites have on voters, the citizens local elites favor in the distribution of material benefits, and the expectations and strategies voters pursue to access welfare benefits. As a whole, these papers suggest that welfare benefits are less likely to be distributed according to a strategy to gain votes than previously expected. 

The survey funded by the NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant was unique in one central way: It was built around cross-referencing elite and voter responses to understand ties and expectations between these two types of actors. The expectation in political science research is that local politicians have a great deal of information on votersÆ preferences from partisanship to material demands. It is also expected that local politicians do the bidding of party leaders and skew anti-poverty benefits to those whose votes are decisive. This survey addresses this claim directly by asking local politicians sampled in the elite survey a number of questions about specific voters sampled in a voter survey conducted the day before. The survey develops several unique behavioral and experimental measures including: a measure of whether or not local politicians can correctly identify votersÆ partisan preferences; a measure of elite preferences over potential beneficiaries of material benefits based on a lottery created at the village level; and an experimental measure of whether or not voters believe partisanship mediates access to jobs and welfare benefits. This is the first large-scale implementation of this cross-referencing survey design and its success in this survey will lead to the use of this method at other levels of political power and in other states in my future work, and I expect in other countries in the work of others.

At this stage, I have completed analysis on one of the papers I describe in my NSF proposal; I am currently analyzing data for the remaining two papers. The first paper tests the ability of local politicians in Indian villages to correctly identify the partisan preferences of voters in their local areas. I find that they often cannot do so despite the presumption among politicians themselves and the political science literature on the topic. I find that very simple benchmarks-- based on aggregate demographics-- perform as well or better than these local politicians at identifying votersÆ partisan preferences. My second paper (in progress) is based on a behavioral measure of targeting preferences. I asked local politicians to allocate 5 token in any denomination across 10 voters sampled in the voter survey conducted the day before. The allocation affected a lottery in which one name was pulled from a box. Each token increased the chance that a voterÆs name would be picked from the box. The winner received 400 Indian rupees (approximatley 4 U.S. Dollars). This provides a clean measure of the distributive preferences of local agents&mdash;without the complications of constraints that impede a local politicianÆs ability to deliver to those they prefer most. This paper will make an important contribution to our understanding of the local broker side of distributive politics and offers important theoretical implications. This will allow me to test theoretical predictions that largely follow from assumptions of brokersÆ preferences but do not measure them.  The third paper (in progress) concerns the strategies of brokerage voters pursue to obtain a range of government anti-poverty benefits. I asked voters whom they contacted to access a range of anti-poverty benefits to see if partisanship mediates these strategies. In addition, I employed a novel survey experiment that captures the effect of the partisanship of a plausible and known village council presi...",,,09/01/2012,Doctoral Dissertation Research in Political Science: Poverty Alleviation in Developing Nations,Grant

43,"The National Research Council in 2013 released the report Monitoring Progress toward Successful K-12 STEM Education: A Nation Advancing?, which outlined 14 Indicators as well as the needed research and development to create a system to monitor the quality of STEM education in the nation. This project is funded in response to a Dear Colleague Letter request for research in the Promoting Innovation in Measurement and Evaluation program focused on developing research and tools to advance the nation's capability to measure these indicators. The researchers in this project will address Indicator 12 - States' use of assessments that measure the core concepts and practices of science and mathematics disciplines. Determining the alignment of state assessments with the core concepts in the current college and career readiness standards adopted by states is a complex process that requires coordination of state policy and assessment practices. This project will design and test an online method and develop a database for tracking and reporting on policies regarding student assessment systems of the 50 states. In addition, the project will develop cross-state criteria for reporting on the content alignment of state assessments to state-adopted standards to improve methodologies for such alignment.

Research activities will be carried out in three phases. In phase one, the project will gather available information about assessment policies of the states and the two national consortia to develop the database of existing policy documents and to structure the online information gathering portal. In the second stage, the researchers will work with expert advisors to refine the online process for expanding the database to make it easily updatable. In the third phase the researchers will work with a subset of state science and mathematics supervisors to test out the collection system. Parallel to the development of the system to report state assessment policies will be the development of frameworks for determining the alignment of state assessments and standards based on the work of the two assessment consortia, state-contracted studies, and the models of state assessments systems recommended by work conducted by the National Research Council science assessment committee.",NSF,4900,NATIONAL OPINION RESEARCH CENTER,1155 E. 60th Street,Chicago,US,Chicago,IL01,National Opinion Research Center,IL,606372745,47.076,,07/29/2014,069512291,299049,08/31/2016,4900,PROGRAM EVALUATION,299049,1445610,069512291,Rolf  Blank,1155 E. 60th Street,Chicago,US,Chicago,IL01,National Opinion Research Center,IL,606372745,blank-rolf@norc.org,Rolf,Blank,,3016349325,kking@nsf.gov,Karen King,7032925124,040106 NSF Education & Human Resource,"The design pilot study (2014&ndash;15 school year) tested a design for collection of state policies information from three sources&mdash;state websites, survey of state assessment staff (focusing on design and methods of reporting), and state content specialists in math and science (focusing on content and alignment of assessments and standards).  The design options and issues of focus in the pilot study are summarized in a paper, developed from the recommendations of a project expert panel (NORC, 2015). 
A key issue for the design study was how to track states use of innovative features of the mathematics assessments being provided through the consortia--Smarter Balanced (SB) and PARCC, including performance tasks (with multiple steps and explanation of work), balance of items across the different levels of depth of knowledge, use of computer-based testing to improve turnaround time for scoring and reporting, measures of learning content and skills, use of adaptive testing to measure a full range of student knowledge, benchmark testing to track progress through the year, and a digital assessment library for formative classroom assessment.  To work toward an indicator of state assessments alignment to standards especially relative to content coverage and levels of cognitive demand, NORC and the advisers considered the Criteria for High-Quality Assessments defined by the chief state school officers (CCSSO, 2014). 
Reporting of state policies and trends over time is equally important for science education as part of the proposed state policies tracking system because of the recent shifts in science education standards and the strong interest in new forms of student assessment to match the direction of the standards.  Some states are following the recommendations of the NRC committee on NGSS science assessments (NRC, 2014), including moving toward a system of science assessment with varied methods, assessing the three dimensions of science instruction, and maintaining annual reporting of student progress. 
Objectives of Design StudyThe design study and pilot project addressed two questions about state assessment policies for mathematics and science and development of a system for tracking and reporting across the states:1)      What core information on state assessment programs and policies should be collected and reported across states, i.e., what information on types of assessments and characteristics of assessment programs are important to have available in a 50-state report or online resource?2)      What is an effective method for reporting comparable information on the extent to which student assessments in math and science are aligned to state-adopted content standards, and what is the relationship to the Common Core State Standards-Mathematics and Next Generation Science Standards?Results
The design pilot study was carried out with support and participation by staff of ten state departments of education (ID, KY, KS, MA, MI, MN, NC, RI, UT, WA).  Each of the states voluntarily participated in the study after a request was sent by NORC to state assessment directors.  Information was collected during May and June 2015, with reporting covering assessments used with schools and students during the 2014&ndash;15 school year (NORC, 2015).
A key decision in planning for a state assessment policies indicator is the degree to which reporting and analysis across states should be comparable and quantifiable.  
The panel recommended collecting and reporting information for the following categories of state assessment policies:
?         Types of state assessments in mathematics and science
?         Intended uses of assessment data
?         Item or task design
?         Timing and methods of administration
?         Cost of assessments?         Methods of assessment reporting and dissemination.
Under the scope of the NSF grant, it would not be possible to conduct a new study of the alignment of each state?s assessments in math and science.  However, the panel recommended that NORC report indicators of the degree of alignment by reporting on assessments content and depth relative to standards &ndash; that is, reporting on grade-specific content topics, cognitive levels of assessment items, and the range of methods used in assessing content knowledge and practices.  The indicators would be selected to provide analysis and comparison of state assessments? content rigor and breadth specific to a grade, and the degree to which the items/tasks address the depth of knowledge and cognitive demand of the standards.  
The following indicators of content alignment were identified for testing in the pilot study:
?         State policy on content standards, and relationship to CCSS and NGSS
?         When standards were developed and approved
?         Source of state assessment framework or blueprint (consortia, state, other)
?         Percentage of grade 5 math assessments on selected content topics
?         Cognitive complexity/demand categories represented in assessment items/tasks
?         Elementary grades at which selected topics were assessed
?         Percentage of grade 11 math assessments on selected content topics
?         Timeline and methods of development of new science assessments?         Major content topics for new science assessments.

Summary on Implementing the Survey Design Online and Next Steps

On reviewing the reporting of assessment content topics in math, advisors recommended that further informaiton be collected on the assessments being reported.  The end of course assessments and comprehensive math assessments should be reported for role in school accountability and high school graduation requirements. The content of these assesments should be summarized across broad content categories comparable by states.

The science assessments content section should summarize the transition process for standards and assessment by states.  The policy position in relation to NGSS should be indicated and the relation to the NRC Framwork for K-12 education.  The content and design of new assessments should be summarized as planning decisions being made and the timeline for implementing new assessments.  Then, at a later point information should be reported on the three dimensions of science content and how they are being assessed. 

The review of the design study by advisers resulted in recommendations to NORC for reporting on degree of alignment of math and science assessment in relation to state content standards.  Many states have conducted alignment studies in the past decade under federal requirements, and states will continue to do studies to meet new peer review requirements of the US ED.  Under the scope of the NSF STEM indicators grant, i will not be possible to conduct new studies of each state's assessments.  The panel recommended that NORC report indicator measures of alignment by focusing on specific content and depth of assessments relative to standards, and by selecitng specific grade levels.  The indicators will provide analysis and reporting across states on the rigor and breadth of assessments as compared to the standards expectations for content topics and cognitive demand.  Regardless of the standards defined by state policy, or the assessments selected by a state, the alignment indicators will provide a common basis for reporting across states.
 
The pilot study instrument asked that states report on the purposes or uses of specific assessments.  All of the states reported the use of requirement mathematics for school accountability under federal and state policies, and eight states reported science assessments were used for school accountability.  Four of the pilot states indicated that data were used for teacher accountability and five states reported data were used for student accountability, primarily for graduation requirements.  All the states reported data were used to inform instruction and curriculum.  In future revisions the advisers recommended asking for an example of local use of assessment data with instruction and curriculum.

For over half a century, the 21cm line of neutral hydrogen (HI) has been one of the main observational tools for galactic studies and cosmology.  It has been used with ever-increasing sensitivity and resolution to investigate the structure of our own Galaxy and of other disk systems, their interactions with other galaxies, the large-scale structure of the Universe, and the physical conditions of high redshift systems.  The recent evolution of 21 cm detectors, spectrometers and multi-feed systems has dramatically expanded both the accessible volume of parameter space and our ability to sample it quickly.  The new seven-feed array for the Arecibo telescope enables it to study the HI Universe to unprecedented volumes and low mass levels.

The first part of this research will explore the faint end of the HI mass function, and act as a pilot for the second part, which will carry out, develop the necessary analysis tools for, and process and make publicly accessible the products of, (a) a fast survey of the Arecibo HI sky, (b) a medium-deep survey of the Virgo cluster of galaxies, and (c) a deep extragalactic HI survey in the Zone of Avoidance, all using the Arecibo feed array system.  All three surveys lend themselves to synergistic coordination with several different projects, not just the present ones, including studies of Milky Way structure and high velocity clouds, a pulsar search, and the detection of radio continuum transients.

The software tools and data products will be made available to the community, and the research work will provide fertile ground for the training of a new generation of US-based single-dish radio astronomers.",NSF,4900,"CORNELL UNIVERSITY, INC",373 Pine Tree Road,Ithaca,US,Ithaca,NY23,Cornell University,NY,148502820,47.049,['Martha P Haynes'],05/15/2003,872612445,448561,05/31/2007,4900,EXTRAGALACTIC ASTRON & COSMOLO,448561,0307661,002254837,Riccardo  Giovanelli,373 Pine Tree Road,Ithaca,US,Ithaca,NY23,Cornell University,NY,148502820,riccardo@astro.cornell.edu,Riccardo,Giovanelli,,6072556505,nsharp@nsf.gov,Nigel Sharp,7032924905,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,"['karen masters, martha haynes, riccardo giovanelli~The Impact of Distance Uncertainties on Local Luminosity and Mass Functions~ApJ~653~2006~861~~~0~ ~0~ ~29/06/2016 04:05:18.556000000', 'Giovanelli, Riccardo, Haynes, Martha, et al.~The Arecibo Legacy fast ALFA Survey.

Transitions of power in democracies from one party to another create unique political contexts.   The prospect of substantial and sometimes unexpected changes in economic, social, or foreign policy stimulates heated debate and strong emotions in the public. This evolving context allows for scholars to assess how emotion regulation shapes political behavior and attitudes. The activation of emotion in the face of unexpected events may manifest in a number of forms: posting on social media, attending town hall meetings, contacting elected officials, signing petitions, and/or participating in social movements. This knowledge helps to explain when and why emotions fuel broad-scale political participation and competition. The data generated from this project enables the investigators to assess theories about the influence of emotion regulation on political participation, i.e. how different types of emotion regulation strategies lead to different types of political behavior.  The project will also provide valuable data for the social science community more broadly.  In particular, the study will produce the first multi-wave panel survey tracking how individual attitudes and behavior change over time in response to political events during the first year of a party transition in the United States. The survey is the first in political science to study how emotion regulation habits vary across individuals in society and considers whether, over time, these habits lead to more consensus or greater polarization. The study utilizes established practices from psychology to measure emotion regulation habits in political contexts. The project also trains graduate and undergraduate students in machine learning, automated text coding, and text-analytics of open-ended survey responses. These are emerging as critical skills in the field of survey research as computing power opens new opportunities for understanding public attitudes through more free-form, naturalistic responses compared to traditional surveys. 

Scientific Merit
This study contributes to a growing body of research exploring the importance of socio-political emotions in fueling public attitudes and behavior. We develop new theory to explain how individual-level emotion regulation habits a) moderate the affective processing of information and b) influence expressive and social political behavior. Pilot tests indicate individuals adept at regulating their emotions through reappraising emotion-provoking stimuli were more likely to become politically active compared to those who use suppressive or avoidance regulation habits. Reappraisers are more likely to transmit their views to others, thus serving as a source of social contagion. This project uses a three-wave panel survey design to conduct a broader test of how emotion regulation shapes issue engagement, changes in perceptions of political responsibility, and changes in levels and forms of political participation. We draw our panel sample from a pool of respondents to a large online national survey conducted just prior to the 2016 elections to obtain pre-election baseline opinions on key policy topics like healthcare, the environment, tax reform, and military use. Subsequent waves of the panel study are timed to survey respondents during critical moments of policy change, or will follow an unexpected extraordinary event, should one arise. The design permits the investigators to observe individual-level change in the use of emotion regulation habits over time, and to test whether different emotion regulation habits make individuals more prone to reexamine their beliefs. If that is the case, these individuals could potentially change beliefs, or reject new information and maintain rigidity in attitudes.

Cyber crimes often involve complicated crime scene investigations. The PIs have been conducting research in digital forensics, wireless networking, and security and privacy. Various prototypical testbeds have been setup for the cutting-edge research. The PIs recognize that these testbeds can and should also be developed as an educational platform for teaching network forensics. The combined education/research platform can be used not only for advancing research in network forensics, but also to enhance undergraduate and graduate education in the areas of wired and wireless networking and network forensics.

Outcomes - intellectual merit: In the past three years, the PIs and their students have achieved the goals of this project (http://ccf.cs.uml.edu/):

Developed a sophisticated and realistic educational infrastructure which provides interesting and realistic cyber-crime scenes for undergraduate and graduate network forensics curricula. We purchased all necessary hardware to build the laboratory and founded the Center for Cyber Forensics at UMass Lowell. The university also sponsored us with $31,000 to this end. The purchase includes a number of computers, network switches and other accessories to set up the local anonymous communication networks that have be integrated with PlanetLab, as well as various hardware devices to build
forensic localization toolkits for possible classroom use. UMass Lowell is a site of Planetlab now.
Developed systematic laboratory projects with innovative educational toolkits such as wireless positioning toolkits. The lab projects include ethical hacking (hacking Project), forensic traceback via Snort (exploration project), anonymous communication networks (exploration project), network traffic data collection (design/implementation), traceback in anonymous communication networks (exploration project), wireless networks - 802.11 WiFi (exploration project), data collection via 3DLoc robot design/implementation project), traceback - evidence collection (design/implementation projects). The dissemination web portal has been deployed at http://ccf.cs.uml.edu/. All student lab projects are online. Under the support of the developed materials, the PIs have developed two digital forensics courses: co-listed 91.460.201 and 91.530.202 (undergraduate students - Selected Topics: Digital Forensics 91.460.201 and for graduate students - Special Topics: Digital Forensics 91.530.202) and 94.562.031 Digital Forensics, which is an online course and a popular course of UMass Lowell Online Master of Science in Information Technology (http://www.continuinged.uml.edu/degrees/msit.cfm).
The enrollment has been increasing. For example, in 2011 Spring, 94.565.031 has 13 students. In 2013 Spring, 26 students have registered the class.
Performed comprehensive formative and summative evaluations for designed lab projects. The project produced one master student, whose master thesis is titled as ""Network Forensics Education Project and Survey Evaluation"". His thesis gives survey design and survey results of some of the designed labs. Survey results show that students are highly motivated to learn network forensics because of the lab projects.


Outcomes &ndash; broader impact: The project has advance experiential learning while promoting teaching and training. Multiple Ph.D, master and undergraduate students haven been involved in the development of a distributed network forensics laboratory, a variety of cyber crime-scene investigations, hardware assembling and proposed lab projects.

Such understanding is necessary to uncover how our Universe evolved and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy.  One important aspect of understanding galaxy formation and evolution is the study of the motion and structure of a galaxy's disk system as observed through the action of the stars and gas of the galaxy.  This project uncovers the archaeological record of mass-assembly and dynamical evolution of today's galaxy disks, revealed by relations between stellar motions and stellar populations.  This basic research project will be conducted at a public University, where advances and discovery are combined with teaching and training to a large and diverse audience.  The proposed project broadly disseminates knowledge and achieves scientific and technical literacy in these ways: (1) Research and teaching infrastructure will be enhanced by launching science projects on a new WIYN Observatory instrument.  (2) STEM course development on galaxy dynamics and spectrograph instrumentation will intertwine with basic research as part of the PI's on-going faculty duties. (3) Graduate and undergraduate training of the future STEM workforce will include astronomical observations, data analysis, instrument commissioning, data mining, and collaborative research.  (4) Educational tools on fiber-optics and their use in society will be developed, implemented, and assessed as part of a public project in our Space Place outreach facility, targeted at school-age students and adults.  (5) A four-year lecture series on the Milky Way and external galaxies will be connected to this educational project, presenting expert knowledge on fiber-optic astronomical surveys to the public.

The projects's primary objective is to couple the relative amplitude of rotation and velocity dispersion of gas and stars with stellar ages and abundances, used as chronometers, to probe the dynamical heating of disks over the past 4--6 Gyrs.  This is analogous to what is being measured with resolved stars in ground-breaking studies of the Milky Way, here albeit more coarsely resolved yet broadly applied to a representative galaxy sample over a wide range in halo mass.  This study is leveraged by a new integral-field unit (IFU) on the WIYN 3.5-m telescope and a large IFU survey being undertaken in the fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

A primary outcome of this work will be to answer the question of whether apparent variations in stellar mass-to-light ratios are due to changes in the stellar initial mass function, uncertainties in the late phases of stellar-evolution, or subtleties in the assumed distribution of luminous and dark matter.  The approach enables accurate measurements of disk mass by explicitly tying the vertical gradients in disk stellar populations into a self-consistent dynamical model.  In so doing, the study determines how recent disk heating-rates depend on galaxy properties and environment, thereby constraining the astrophysical source(s) of this phenomenon.  The project calibrates a method for measuring stellar velocity dispersions via the asymmetric drift between gas and stars, a related dynamical phenomenon discovered decades ago in the Milky Way and now measurable in external galaxies.  The method will be applied to the current generation of integral-field spectroscopic survey data on nearby galaxies and has application at high redshift.  The broader implications of this project include the following:  (1) Determining the vertical heating rate of spiral disks using spectrophotometric chronometers is novel and establishes a concrete picture of the stellar density profile in the largest dissipational structures in the universe.  (2) Coupling differences between stellar and gas kinematics with stellar population ages provides a new means for estimating dynamical mass and calibrating the mass-to-light ratios of stellar populations.  (3) Calibrating mass-to-light ratios places stringent constraints on late phases of stellar evolution, the efficiency with which star-formation locks baryons into stars, and the inner density profiles of dark halos.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SYSTEM,21 North Park Street,MADISON,US,Madison,WI02,University of Wisconsin-Madison,WI,537151218,47.049,,07/06/2015,161202122,693710,08/31/2019,4900,EXTRAGALACTIC ASTRON & COSMOLO,693710,1517006,041188822,Matthew A Bershady,"21 North Park Street, Suite 6401",Madison,US,Madison,WI02,University of Wisconsin-Madison,WI,537141218,mab@astro.wisc.edu,Matthew,Bershady,A,6082623071,jpesce@nsf.gov,Joseph E.

49,"Having a reputation for being cooperative, trustworthy, and generous, which social scientists call a ""prosocial reputation,"" is known to facilitate a surprisingly wide range of socially important transactions. For example, pro-social reputations are associated with increased social support, better health, and more opportunities for mutually beneficial partnerships and economic relationships. However, reputations may change and when that happens, it is likely that their effects change, too. This malleability of reputations is thought to come about when opinions and information about others are exchanged between individuals and reputations spread through social networks. The research funded by this awards will investigate when and how such spread occurs; its consequences for health, well-being, cooperative relationships, and social status; and whether prosocial reputations spread differently and have different life consequences for women and for men.  

A critical problem in network research is the difficulty of collecting whole network data that contain all salient social relationships of a particular group of individuals. For instance, in the United States social networks span large geographic distances and due to increased mobility and compartmentalization of various networks to differentiated social realms such as organizations, neighborhoods, and family, often do not have clearly demarcated boundaries. This makes the mapping of whole networks very difficult. Therefore, the researcher will conduct the research in the Orkney archipelago of Scotland. The archipelago contains multiple islands with small populations (< 160 individuals), for whom day-to-day social relations are geographically bounded and, because of infrastructural constraints, relatively isolated. This degree of isolation implies that most social effects of reputations originate within the community, making it a near ideal environment to study the overarching implications of social networks and reputations on individuals' lives. Emory University doctoral student Hanne van der Iest, supervised by Dr. Paul L. Hooper, will carry out this research in one island community in Orkney. Within this community, she will comprehensively map multiple social networks through the collection of six waves of bimonthly surveys and behavioral observations of cooperation and collective action over a one year period. Scale development through interviews and observation will precede survey administration to arrive at locally valid measurement instruments for study constructs. Findings from this research will contribute to our understanding of the dynamic spread of prosocial reputations among women and men, and their changing effects on health, well-being, social status, and productive exchange. These findings are important for social scientists who want to understand the role of prosocial behavior in human societies as well as for those concerned with improving the quality of community life and individual well-being.",NSF,4900,EMORY UNIVERSITY,"1599 Clifton Rd NE, 4th Floor",Atlanta,US,Atlanta,GA05,Emory University,GA,303224250,47.075,['Hanne  Van der Iest'],06/19/2015,066469933,24613,08/31/2016,4900,DDRI Cult Anthro,24613,1528939,066469933,Paul L Hooper,"1599 Clifton Rd NE, 4th Floor",Atlanta,US,Atlanta,GA05,Emory University,GA,303224250,phooper@emory.edu,Paul,Hooper,L,4047272503,dwinslow@nsf.gov,Deborah Winslow,7032927315,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The extent to which we cooperate with non-kin may be unique to our species, making it a feature of human behavior of particular anthropological interest. Prosocial reputations, that is, impressions of the cooperative tendencies, trustworthiness, and generosity of others, have been viewed as a key catalyst for the evolution of cooperation in humans. If individuals can build prosocial reputations, and these are rewarded by others, prosociality becomes evolutionarily viable. This project aimed to contribute to our understanding of prosocial reputations.

In our proposal and addendum, we have outlined four major research objectives, described below. To pursue these objectives we have conducted mixed-method research in a remote community in the UK. We have capitalized on the complementing strengths of participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and a longitudinal survey design in the pursuit of making a novel scientific contribution.

Our research objectives were: 1) to investigate, through longitudinal network surveys of social relations, how prosocial reputations spread within social networks over time in one remote community, 2) to investigate whether and how prosocial reputations and change therein affect people's cooperative partnerships, health and well-being, relationship and social status, using survey responses, interviews, and participant observation, 3) to characterize local meanings of reputations and prosociality through participant observation and interviews, and 4) to investigate if and how gender moderates the previous objectives.

The research location uniquely suited these research objectives. First, estimation of network effects becomes more accurate when network boundaries are clear. Infrastructural constraints within this remote community necessitate inhabitants to spend most of their time on site. The relative isolation implies that most social effects stemming from prosocial reputations originate within the community. Second, our survey response structure (mapping full networks) capped community size and the research community was suitably small at about 80 individuals.

During the NSF funded phase of this project the co-PI has successfully integrated in the research community, obtained local approval for the study, engaged in participant observation by actively contributing to community institutions (e.g. baking, volunteering at the local school, sewing, participating in the local choir), has mapped out local conditions (e.g. local economy, demographics, political organization, infrastructure), collected data on the local meanings and manifestations of prosocial reputations through structured and unstructured interviews and observation. Additionally, the co-PI has developed a longitudinal (6 wave) social network survey on site and has run survey logistics and administration during her stay.

Consequently, the co-PI has gained significant fieldwork experience in a remote setting as she independently developed the field site in three repeat visits between October 2014 and June 2016. This project has thus provided valuable training to a female PhD student.

51,"Understanding the socio-political impact of ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity is a vital concern for both social scientists and policy-makers. Using several different datasets measuring diversity around the world, researchers have found that it often has a negative impact on democracy, development and political stability. However, these findings rely on fundamentally flawed datasets: their demographic estimates come from questionable sources and do not vary within countries or over time. This makes them ill-suited to studying outcomes like war and development, which often change rapidly and cluster in space. In addition, the existing datasets cannot be directly compared, making it difficult to assess their accuracy. Rather than investing time and money in the collection of new data, this project builds on an existing resource: 9 million survey responses from 175 countries around the world. By using Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to compare these surveys to official statistics and generate improved diversity estimates, other researchers will be able to apply this method in other areas like health and inequality where government statistics are missing or questionable. Further, this project will make our results directly comparable to existing datasets. These data and methods will be made available through a user-friendly online portal, where scientists, policy-makers, and members of the public will be able to explore the data. They will also be able to create their own datasets and use visualization tools to see how the world's demographics are changing and consider what this means for our future.

Existing estimates of ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity are correlated cross-sectionally with a number of socio-political and economic outcomes including development, conflict, and social capital. Close examination of these data raises validity concerns: few are based on high-quality official statistics, the majority coming from questionable secondary sources. Further, criteria for group inclusion (i.e., ontologies) are opaque and inconsistently applied. Even where they appear accurate, data are static and aggregated at the country level, although they are often used to explain time-varying and spatially disaggregated outcomes. Ontologies in extant datasets are also incompatible, making comparison and integration difficult. This proposal improves existing measures by applying machine learning methods to compare 9 million responses across 175 countries with a new database of census results. An algorithm will identify survey design features that maximize accuracy, to define a compensatory weighting scheme across these features. The result is a set of survey-based demographic estimates with improved validity, even for countries lacking reliable census data. This method of triangulating surveys and official statistics is generalizable to research areas that use either source and can also inform improved survey design. The project will also develop tools for linking surveys, censuses, and existing datasets based on explicit and transparent decision rules to facilitate their comparison and integration. An online portal will provide access to datasets and code, supporting customized data manipulation and visualization. The methods and tools proposed here -- emphasizing accuracy, transparency, and cross-resource integration -- should serve as a model for future data collection.

52,"General Summary

This project seeks to explain how rule-based social policy can lead to citizen empowerment. Specifically, this research examines whether the extension of guaranteed public service access to rural-based citizens severs over time the relationship between these citizens and rural political leaders who use clientalistic methods to exert political control. The PI examines the effect of national policies (like the conditional cash transfer Bolsa Familia program in Brazil) affect local politics. This research will collect household survey data on local political attitudes and behavior in Northeast Brazil. The PI collects a targeted stratified sample of 2,040 people in 30 municipalities in three states will facilitate controlled comparisons between the beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of national rule-based social programs. The data will be analyzed using a hierarchical regression model to identify (1) whether political relationships, citizen practices and voting behavior are affected by experiences with national rule-based social policies, and (2) to what extent this relationship varies depending on the municipal and state governance context.

Technical Summary

This research seeks to understand whether secure access to social policy can turn dependent clients into autonomous and active citizens. It is also designed to help resolve debates about the political effects of rule-based social policy, the project will provide new evidence, tools and datasets to help policymakers understand how policies can shape downstream policy demands and help build effective local democracy. The PI gathers data on citizens' experiences with government, their autonomy and their voting behavior. The PI collects a targeted stratified sample of 2,040 people in 30 municipalities in three states in Northeast Brazil will facilitate controlled comparisons between the beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of national rule-based social programs. This data collection strategy facilitates controlled comparisons between the beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of national rule-based social programs. List and conjoint survey experiments are performed to uncover sensitive measures such as voting motivations, political autonomy and exposure to clientelism. Inferential leverage will be improved by screening for respondents who are close to the eligibility thresholds for social policy, and by exploiting the fact that some respondents are on waiting lists where they are eligible but have not yet received a benefit. The data will be analyzed using a hierarchical regression model to identify (1) whether political relationships, citizen practices and voting behavior are affected by experiences with national rule-based social policies, and (2) to what extent this relationship varies depending on the municipal and state governance context.",NSF,4900,PRESIDENT AND FELLOWS OF HARVARD COLLEGE,1033 MASSACHUSETTS AVE,Cambridge,US,Cambridge,MA05,Harvard University,MA,021385369,47.075,['Jonathan  Phillips'],08/11/2016,082359691,18497,07/31/2017,4900,Political Science DDRIG,18497,1560659,001963263,Frances  Hagopian,1737 Cambridge St,Cambridge,US,Cambridge,MA05,Harvard University Government Department,MA,021383846,fhagopian@gov.harvard.edu,Frances,Hagopian,,6174955501,bhumes@nsf.gov,Brian D. Humes,7032927284,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"This research provides primary evidence that the extension of guaranteed public benefits by Brazil?s federal government over the past decade has empowered voters in local politics and helped to make politics more inclusive and programmatic. While many voters in Brazil?s northeast have been subject to clientelist threats by politicians with monopoly control over public resources, voters who receive the Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia conditional cash transfer ``from Brasilia?? are more confident that government will be responsive, more likely to reject hypothetical offers to buy their votes, and more likely to agree that government is run in the interests of all.

These insights were made possible by an innovative household survey design that sampled 1,881 respondents 27 municipalities in Alagoas, Bahia and Cear&aacute; states. While plans to use a regression discontinuity design on income to identify the effect of Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia were not feasible due to the weakness of compliance around the discontinuity, a secondary inferential method of comparing transfer recipients with those on the scheme?s waiting list permitted identification of the policy?s effects, since both groups met the same eligibility criteria and differ in recipient status only due to idiosyncrasies in timing and implementation.

The survey then used novel conjoint survey measures to measure citizens? expectations about others? attitudes, allowing the team to isolate the mechanism by which policies can shape local politics as a shift in citizens? mutual expectations. Respondents believed that hypothetical voters who received Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia are substantially more likely to vote against clientelist candidates. Since voting against clientelism is a collective action problem in which each wishes to avoid the punishment of voting against a clientelist winner, confidence that other voters will vote for reform can provide a potential route out of the clientelist trap.

However, the survey also revealed that the empowering effects of policy are heavily mediated by the pre-existing content of local politics. Only in Cear&aacute; &ndash; a state with a 20-year history of governance reform &ndash; was the policy able to generate collective confidence among voters that clientelism is unlikely to succeed, to encourage political participation, and to deter voting for clientelist candidates. This suggests a powerful complementarity between national and local inclusive governance but also a potential risk that national policy may induce political disengagement in states that have yet to match the pace of reform, such as Alagoas. One unexpected finding was that the effect of Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia may be most transformative to political attitudes, and most supportive of inclusive demand, where there are few other beneficiaries. This suggests that the biggest impact of Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia may arise in programmatically-governed places with low coverage of national inclusive policy.

This evidence helps resolve two puzzles about politics in the Brazilian Northeast. First, while other governance reforms have burnt out or been subject to clientelist restoration, Cear&aacute; has sustained inclusive governance for two decades. A significant portion of this success may be attributable to the introduction of complementary reforms led by national governments from the late 1990s that have bolstered the economic security and political autonomy of Cear&aacute;'s citizens.

The second puzzle is how clientelism is able to survive in much of the remainder of the Northeast despite the scale and intensity of national inclusive policy. The results suggest that in states like Alagoas where local political control remains in the hands of traditional elites and clientelism remains common, national policies may have a limited effect, encouraging some citizens to disengage from local politics. Promoting programmatic reform in adverse contexts may then rely on alternative types of national intervention, for example reform to political institutions, or may simply need to wait for complementary local processes of reform.

53,"This project assesses the American public's views of the Ebola outbreak and how these views influence their communication behaviors related to the outbreak such as information seeking, information sharing and information processing. The project focuses on the degree to which such views are influenced by the public's perceptions regarding the importance and personal relevance of this issue, as well as their emotional responses to the outbreak and whether they perceive this issue as psychologically distant and abstract. The research involves a survey, based on a nationally representative sample of 1,000 participants, who are randomly assigned to two experimental conditions (one emphasizing that there are no known cases or Ebola transmission in the United States, and the other that avoids this fact). The use of this experimental survey design provides a unique capacity to understand why one third of the U.S. adults (measured in a September 2014 survey) are concerned that there will be a large Ebola outbreak in the U.S. The participants in the surveys are being drawn from an academic-quality, probability-based online panel. 

In addition to the issue-specific value of knowing more about risk perceptions related to the Ebola outbreak, findings from this project will inform the design of communication messages related to risk issues that are often perceived to be psychologically distant by the American public, such as climate change and overpopulation. The specific mechanisms through which the study variables influence risk communication behaviors will also inform communication campaigns aimed at encouraging greater public engagement with risk information. In doing so, the proposed research will integrate theory from social psychology and risk communication to explore the utility of psychological distance in informing public communication about emerging public health risks.",NSF,4900,"RESEARCH FOUNDATION FOR THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK, THE",520 Lee Entrance,Amherst,US,Buffalo,NY26,SUNY at Buffalo,NY,142282567,47.075,,10/29/2014,038633251,84110,04/30/2016,4900,DECISION RISK & MANAGEMENT SCI,84110,1460714,020657151,Janet Z Yang,329 Baldy Hall,Buffalo,US,Buffalo,NY26,SUNY at Buffalo,NY,142601060,zyang5@buffalo.edu,Janet,Yang,Z,7166451169,roconnor@nsf.gov,Robert E. O'Connor,7032928761,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The goal of the proposed research is to conduct an experimental survey to assess: 1) what constitutes risk perception surrounding the Ebola outbreak among the U.S. public and how it influences their communication behaviors such as information seeking, information sharing, and information processing, as well as risk-related decision making such as donation and support for other governmental relief efforts; 2) how psychological distance, perceived salience, and personal relevance influence public risk perception and subsequent  ommunication behaviors and decision making. In particular, given the geographic distance between the outbreak and the research location, the proposed research will examine how psychological distance influences risk communication behaviors through risk perception.

Based on nationally representative survey data collected from October 21 to November 4, 2014 through Knowledge Networks, one peer-reviewed journal article and two conference papers have been generated from this project. The journal article, titled ""Altruism during Ebola: Risk perception, issue salience, cultural cognition, and information processing"" was published online in December 2015 in Risk Analysis. This paper focuses on participants' willingness to support families and friends to travel to West African as Ebola responders, as a proxy measure for altruistic behavior. This study examined how deeply rooted cultural values and worldviews, issue-specific attitude, and message-specific cognitive processing and affective responses influenced individualsÆ altruistic behavioral intention related to the Ebola outbreak. Results indicate that this study successfully manipulated risk perception related to the Ebola outbreak and showed that perceived issue salience and deliberate processing had different impacts on altruistic behavioral intention between the two experimental conditions, whereas cultural cognition worldview and negative emotions such as sadness and anger influenced altruistic behavioral intention across the experimental conditions. The results of this study highlight the importance of formative research and audience segmentation for risk communication efforts aimed at fostering greater attention and support to combat the Ebola crisis. In particular, when targeting at audiences who believe that the Ebola outbreak might influence the U.S. if not effectively controlled, communication messages might include more facts and statistics because these individuals are more likely to process this information. In contrast, among those who do not view the Ebola outbreak as an urgent risk issue that might threaten the U.S., messages that strike the emotional cord such as sadness and sympathy may be more effective. For both groups of potential audiences, nonetheless, it is crucial to aim at reducing the perceived social distance between the victims and those who can offer help. The infographic messages designed by the CDC to prepare families and loved ones of responders seem to be a good example that could not only demystify misperceptions about the transmission of Ebola, but also encourage more helping behaviors from the U.S. public. Specifically, these messages explain how Ebola is spread using vivid images and simple language, coupled with interactive games that explain to children that people sick with Ebola need to see a doctor just like everyone else and Ebola responders are heroes. These messages can effectively bridge social distance and encourage helping behaviors beyond monetary donations such as supporting oneÆs family and friends to go to West Africa to aid with the response to the Ebola outbreak.

The conference paper, titled ""Risk perception and communication behaviors during the Ebola outbreak"" was presented at the Society for Risk Analysis (SRA)'s annual meeting in December, 2015.

The funded work will extend the survey by 1) exploring the evolution of LAEs by studying a complementary sample at lower redshift; 2) measuring the 3-D distribution of the LAEs; 3) probing the stellar winds, dynamics, and HI column densities of LAEs via extensive high-resolution spectroscopy with the Robert Stobie Spectrograph on the South African Large Telescope (SALT) and the LDSS3 spectrograph on Magellan, and 4) performing near-infrared spectroscopy with FLAMINGOS-2 on Gemini-South to measure systemic redshifts and LAE metallicities. The research promises significant progress towards a complete picture of the birth and early growth of the precursors of present-day L* galaxies.

The primary goal of this research was to understand the formation and early growth of typical present-day  galaxies like the Milky Way.  Our previous research had identified a particular type of distant galaxies called Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) as progenitors of Milky-Way type galaxies in the present-day universe.  We had observed these LAEs at an epoch 2 billion years after the beginning of our universe.  In the research  conducted here, we performed expanded analyses on that sample of LAEs and also added parallel analyses on a new sample of LAEs observed one billion years later i.e., three billion years after the beginning of the universe.  This means that the light from these LAEs traveled for almost 11 billion years before reaching Earth, making them some of the earliest galaxies to have formed in our universe.  


 
Intellectual merit:  


We published 25 peer-reviewed journal articles to which our contributions were supported by this research grant.  Our new sample of over 200 LAEs was studied extensively; we found from analysis of their clustering on the sky that they also represent progenitors of typical present-day galaxies like the Milky Way.  We also used the FORS spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope to study the rest-frame ultraviolet spectra of these LAEs and to compare them with those of more massive galaxies at the same epoch called Lyman Break Galaxies.  Then we performed near-infrared spectroscopy on these galaxies with the MMIRS instrument on the Magellan Telescope to measure more precise distances and star formation rates for these galaxies.   
 
 Understanding the process of galaxy formation is a key goal of extragalactic astronomy.  LAEs are also being used by the Hobby Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) to trace the large scale structure of the universe  in order to probe the nature of the mysterious dark energy that is caused our universe's expansion to accelerate.  The results of our narrow-band surveys are being used to improve the experimental design of HETDEX and have thus made a key contribution to the field of observational cosmology. 
Broader impacts:  


This project also provided training in astrophysics research for several undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs. Four of these trainees were  members of groups that are currently underrepresented in science (two women and two Latinos).  By   continuing our  successful collaboration with Chilean astronomers, we  fostered the  international cooperation that is necessary for  astronomy  in the coming  decades.  We participated extensively in outreach activities both at Rutgers and PSU which helped to demonstrate the excitement of current astronomical research to the public. These efforts included Rutgers Day, collaborations between Hayden Planetarium and Rutgers, Astrofest at Penn State University, and distributing key results from our results via the media.

This project is a broad theoretical study of the fundamental astrophysical processes used to understand the formation of the first stars and galaxies, the production and distribution of heavy elements, and the physical state of the intergalactic medium at early times in the history of the Universe.  Star formation, chemical history, ionization processes, transport of heavy elements, cooling and heating of the gas, formation and destruction of molecules, and the production and transport of ionizing radiation from the first stars and quasars, will all benefit from the developed modeling algorithms, which will be incorporated into publicly accessible numerical simulations.  This research will help to understand the evolution of galaxies, stars, and gas in the high-redshift Universe, including current and future observations at optical, ultra-violet, infrared, and sub-millimeter wavelengths.

The principal investigator (PI) and his team members will continue their long record of giving numerous educational and public presentations of research and general-interest astronomy.  The PI has sponsored high school students in summer projects, and expects to continue doing so.  He is also active in graduate and postdoctoral training, and national and professional service organizations.  Previous research by this group has promoted several general tools, including new simulation codes and the application of atomic and molecular physics to interstellar and intergalactic studies, as well as to spectrum formation codes.",NSF,4900,"REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO, THE","3100 Marine Street, Room 481",Boulder,US,Boulder,CO02,University of Colorado at Boulder,CO,803090572,47.049,,09/05/2007,007431505,546799,08/31/2012,4900,EXTRAGALACTIC ASTRON & COSMOLO,546799,0707474,007431505,J.

We are developing a new Applied Geophysics course that represents an adaptation of a pedagogical model developed at the University of Massachusetts. We are also creating new opportunities for undergraduate research in geophysics. The lab component of our Applied Geophysics course includes six modules dedicated to seismic refraction and reflection, ground-penetrating radar, gravimetry, direct-current electrical methods, magnetic surveying, and cross-hole geophysics. Two four-hour field labs are devoted to each module. The instructor designs the first survey using each method, for the purposes of demonstrating proper survey design, data collection, safety measures, and data reduction. Alternating groups of students lead the second lab in each module, thus calling on student groups to take leadership roles in designing surveys, assessing the limitations of various methods through forward modeling, and organizing data collection efforts. The instructor-led experiments take advantage of diverse sites off campus. Student-led surveys are being conducted at various locations on campus, including our Geophysical Test Site and adjacent Experimental Well Field. Interpretations incorporate complementary data sets from multiple geophysical methods. New access to state-of-the-art geophysical equipment is having a major positive impact not only on the preparation of geology majors, but also on other physical science and engineering students.",NSF,4900,BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY,One Dent Drive,LEWISBURG,US,Lewisburg,PA10,Bucknell University,PA,178372111,47.076,['Mary Beth  Gray'],01/23/2002,003030335,65444,01/31/2006,4900,CCLI-ADAPTATION AND IMPLEMENTA,65444,0126491,003030335,Mary Beth  Gray,One Dent Drive,LEWISBURG,US,Lewisburg,PA10,Bucknell University,PA,178372111,mbgray@bucknell.edu,Mary Beth,Gray,,5705771146,ksverdru@nsf.gov,Keith Sverdrup,7032928670,040106 NSF Education & Human Resource,,,,02/01/2002,Integrating Applied Geophysics into a Student-Centered Undergraduate Curriculum,Grant

TITLE: Probing Galactic Structure and Evolution with Extragalactic Planetary Nebulae

ABSTRACT

Dr.. Robin Ciardullo, at the Pennsylvania State University, will undertake three projects that utilize extragalactic planetary nebulae (PNe) to investigate astrophysical questions. The projects consist of: 1) the measurement of the perpendicular kinematics of PNe in near face-on spirals, to constrain galaxy disk masses; 2) the measurement of the composition of PNe in the bulge of the galaxy M31, to understand both an apparent low oxygen abundance and to determine the role of type IA supernovae in the evolution of the M31 bulge; and 3) to probe the kinematics of the Virgo cluster intra-cluster PNe, to determine the relative importance of intra-cluster stars within cluster galaxies..

The major area of broader impact that results from this work involves the training of undergraduate and graduate students, with an emphasis on students from traditionally under-represented groups. The fact that extragalactic planetary nebulae have so many uses suggests that students who work on this project are exposed to a great many topics in astronomy.  Finally, public outreach activities will also be undertaken.",NSF,4900,"PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY, THE",110 Technology Center Building,UNIVERSITY PARK,US,University Park,PA05,Pennsylvania State Univ University Park,PA,168027000,47.049,,07/26/2006,003403953,229455,07/31/2011,4900,GALACTIC ASTRONOMY PROGRAM,229455,0607416,003403953,Robin B Ciardullo,110 Technology Center Building,UNIVERSITY PARK,US,University Park,PA05,Pennsylvania State Univ University Park,PA,168027000,rbc@astro.psu.edu,Robin,Ciardullo,B,8148656601,@nsf.gov,,,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,"['Herrmann, KA;Ciardullo, R~Kinematic Mass Measurements of Inner and Outer Spiral Disks~International Conference on Hunting for the Dark: The Hidden Side of Galaxy Formation~1240~2010~~371~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=192702965#000283480000092', 'Ciardullo, R~The Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function: Pieces of the Puzzle~International Workshop in honor of Agnes Acker on Legacies of the Macquarie/AAO/Strasbourg H-alpha Planetary Nebula Project (MASH)~27~2010~~149~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=189075558#000278133900004', 'Herrmann, KA;Ciardullo, R;Sigurdsson, S~Kinematic Signs of Halo Substructure in Spiral Galaxies~Conference on Galaxies in Isolation: Exploring Nature Versus Nurture~421~2010~~259~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=196046683#000288970700065', 'Ciardullo, R;Herrmann, KA~The Mass-to-Light Ratios of Spiral Disks~Galaxies in the Local Volume Symposium~ ~2008~~155~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=176643291#000263468700032', 'Herrmann, KA;Ciardullo, R~Studies of Six Nearby Galaxies: Is the Disk Mass-to-Light Ratio Constant?~International Conference on Formation and Evolution of Galaxy Disks~396~2008~~69~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=175102956#000261720400019', 'Hill, GJ;Gebhardt, K;Komatsu, E;Drory, N;MacQueen, PJ;Adams, J;Blanc, GA;Koehler, R;Rafal, M;Roth, MM;Kelz, A;Gronwall, C;Ciardullo, R;Schneider, DP~The Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX): Description and Early Pilot Survey Results~International Conference on Panoramic Views of Galaxy Formation and Evolution~399~2008~~115~http://sourceId/WoS?recid=176135947#000262978800024']","['Young, J., Eracleous, M., Gronwall, C., Shemmer, O., Netzer, H., Sturm, E., & Ciardullo, R.~In Search of Quasar Host Galaxies~Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society~43~2011~ ~~~0~ ~0~ ~28/07/2018 04:17:48.793000000', 'Zheng, Z., Malhotra, S., Wang, J., Rhoads, J., Finkelstein, S., Gawiser, E., Gronwall, C., Guaita, L., Nilsson, K., & Ciardullo, R.~X-ray Constraints on the Lyman Alpha Escape Fraction~Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society~43~2011~ ~~~0~ ~0~ ~28/07/2018 04:17:48.793000000', 'Gawiser, E;

61,"The outcomes of higher education are a consequence of individuals' personality traits and many
dimensions of the university experience. The Caltech Cohort Study (CCS) will track the entire
undergraduate student body of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) over several years. It
uses repeated, incentivized surveys to elicit behavioral proxies: risk aversion, strategic sophistication,
competitiveness, social behavior, etc. The results will be married with objective outcomes: academic,
social, and financial. The project will examine the evolution of attributes over college years, the
formation of social interactions, and ultimately how certain attributes interact to produce educational
outcomes. The CCS also serves as an ideal environment for answering fundamental questions about
the external validity of incentivized surveys and laboratory experiments.

The CCS has four unique features. First, Caltech's small size makes it possible to track nearly
the entire student body over time (90% of students completed the first three surveys). Second, the
survey design allows measurement of a large set of behavioral traits for each individual. Third,
the repeated nature of the study makes it possible to track the stability of these traits across time
with minimal selection bias. Fourth, the array of behavioral traits elicited can be tied to real-world
behaviors and outcomes. The combination of these elements should be invaluable for a large battery
of basic social science questions.

The proposed study has the potential to improve the educational process in US higher education.
Understanding what impacts social and scholastic outcomes will help design certain aspects of college
education aimed at increasing well-being and academic performance, as well as furthering gender and
racial equality.

The proposal focuses on three areas. First, the dataset's longitudinal nature will allow for a careful
inspection of the stability (or lack thereof) of a wide array of behavioral attributes. Second, the rich
data on different layers of interactions over time (social, academic, and geographic) combined with
the comprehensive set of elicited attributes will allow us to study network formation processes. Last,
the data can be cross-checked against Caltech's experimental laboratory data to examine the impacts
of selection into experiments as well as the differences in responses occurring in the lab and outside.
The survey will also allow for a comparison of responses across other platforms and populations.
Ultimately, the detailed longitudinal data that will be collected have the potential to uncover
predictors of academic outcomes (chosen major, grades, and graduation), and the channels affecting
the evolution of different traits.",NSF,4900,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,1200 E California Blvd,PASADENA,US,Pasadena,CA27,California Institute of Technology,CA,911250600,47.075,,06/20/2016,009584210,240882,06/30/2019,4900,ECONOMICS,240882,1629613,009584210,Leeat  Yariv,1200 E.

62,"The project will conduct a mapping study to describe the contexts, characteristics and practices of a national sample of science-focused Out-of-School Time (OST) programs and identify exemplar programs for further study.  A Field Study will seek more detailed knowledge about these programs by interviewing participants, alumni, and other stakeholders, and observing program activities. The results of these studies will be presented at a working conference at the end of the project to discuss how to develop a survey instrument to measure important youth outcomes from OST programs and collect baseline data for an anticipated longitudinal study. 

This project will provide new descriptive materials about the operation and practice of the out of school learning of science. It will produce a literature review, a list of organizations that provide out of school science training and a plan for future data collection. A qualitative study will be conducted to answer questions such as to what extent OST science experiences spark interest or rather nurture or sustain it and how these outcomes fit within the broader context of lifelong learning and development.

The challenge of this comparison stems not only from the variety of disciplines that each youth-based out-of-school time program might focus on its primary scientific discipline, but also from the differences in program format and implementation. The project developed a framework that allows for program to program comparisons by focusing on the learning activities used by these programs. This project developed a seven-part typology of learning activities that examines differences based on the pdagogy used by out-of-school time prorgams. The seven part typology categorizes learning activities into disovering, creating/making, collaborating, competing, caretaking, teaching, and perfomring. OST programs may include two, three, or even all seven of these learning activities. Youth are often attracted to OST programs because of the activities that the programs offer. As a result, this project developed a survey instrument that identifies youth preferences in these seven categories of learning activities as well as developing a protocol for the analysis of OST pograms for the learning activities that they include. The utility of this approach also extends to teaching and learning activities in formal educational settings. As a result, educators in formal settings have begun to take notice of this framework as a means of helping classroom teachers to understand, communcate, and improve their teaching practice. The rpoject has generated work in the development of a survey tool, curriculum analysis tools, and a program acttivity observation tool. Work on these instruments continues.

63,"Introspection tells us that agents often exert effort to overcome temptation. In addition, such effortful self-control is broadly consistent with the findings of Ameriks, Caplin and Leahy (QJE, forthcoming) that agents who plan and budget tend to save more and accumulate greater wealth. It is important to develop new theoretical models and to enrich the empirical evidence on self-control.  There are two related, but independent, parts to the proposal. The first part is empirical. Caplin and Leahy will use a new survey designed and implemented in cooperation with TIAA-CREF to study the role of self- control problems in wealth accumulation and to study the mechanisms that people employ to overcome these problems. Preliminary findings indicate that the measure of self-control developed in this survey is strongly correlated with wealth accumulation and that there appear to be two important types of self-control problems: over-consumption and under-consumption.  The next stage is to examine the economic, behavioral and demographic correlates of self-control. Prof. Tom Tyler of the Psychology Department of New York University and Dr. John Ameriks of the TIAA-CREF Institute will be collaborating on this research.

The second part of the proposal is theoretical. Caplin and Leahy will develop new models of effortful self-control and investigate the implications for wealth accumulation. A preliminary model indicates that attitudes towards risk affect the incentive to attend to consumption expenditures with important implications for saving behavior. John Ameriks will be collaborating on this research.
(1) The Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity
The project will increase our understanding of consumption and saving behavior. There has been little prior work on effortful self-control and few estimates of the effect of self-control on wealth accumulation. Professors Caplin and Leahy have experience in survey design and in the construction of theoretical models of economic behavior. A previous survey led to one publication the Quarterly Journal of Economics and a submission to the Review of Economics and Statistics.
(2) The Broader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity

McFadden  University of California - Berkeley  SBR-9601149    Economic and other surveys are plagued by the continuing problem  of trying to elicit information about respondents' true behavior.   Survey questions must be carefully framed to accomplish the aim  of eliciting accurate information.  Among the specific problems  arising in survey design to be investigated are anchoring and  focal points.  Anchoring refers to a widely observed and well-  documented family effects in which presumably irrelevant cues or  settings provided by questions influence responses.  For example,  subjects asked to judge whether an uncertain quantity, such as  the length of the Amazon, exceeds a certain value (the anchor)  and then asked for an estimate, will typically give a response  that is pulled toward the anchor.  Focal point refers to a  rounded off, conventional response.  For example, subjects asked  for the time it takes them to get to work will frequently give  answers such as 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 minutes, rather than  intermediate values, so that one observes spikes of responses at  these focal values even though the true values have a continuous  distribution.

65,"One of the major difficulties in understanding how autocracy arises in electoral democracies is the limited data that exist on citizen participation in and support for autocratic moves. Such moves often arise suddenly, making them difficult for analysts to anticipate and study. One such move was the successful effort by President Daniel Ortega to void the participation of his major opponents in Nicaragua's recent and upcoming elections. This case provides us a unique opportunity to examine an effort to install electorally-validated autocracy. By closely examining this case, the findings can impact foreign policy and domestic organizations that support democracy and its development.

The project uses a multi-wave survey design. An initial national public opinion survey gauges citizen vote support for Ortega, and then two subsequent national public opinion surveys trace the evolution of citizen attitudes in the months following the initial survey. These surveys will be used to examine the following question: Is citizen support for autocracy truly broad-gauged and sustained, as elected autocrats claim, or is it more limited and subject to rapid decay as the oppressive reality of strong-man rule emerges?",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,1 UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,GAINESVILLE,US,Gainesville,FL03,University of Florida,FL,326112002,47.075,"['Lawrence C Dodd', 'Won-ho  Park']",07/19/2017,969663814,75000,07/31/2019,4900,POLITICAL SCIENCE,75000,1712344,159621697,Leslie  Anderson,,,US,Gainesville,FL03,University of Florida,FL,326112002,landerso@polisci.ufl.edu,Leslie,Anderson,,3523920262,bhumes@nsf.gov,Brian D.

66,"The relationship between globalization and social policy has become an increasing focus of scholarly research. Does globalization increase insecurity? If so, who is most affected? Are governments able to respond by providing adequate social protections? Or does globalization itself limit their capacity to do so? To date, much of this research has focused on government spending and provision; it has not investigated how globalization affects the policy preferences of individuals. 
	
This project explores whether and how individuals? exposure to foreign-owned firms causes them to favor more social spending. The research is located in post-socialist Ukraine; it therefore focuses on the attitudes of citizens in a new democracy that is also in transition to a market economy; the research will therefore speak to important political as well as economic issues in this important set of cases. 
	
In order to study individual attitudes, this project generates original data, using a survey design that minimizes many of the problems inherent in existing surveys. The survey sites are four smaller cities, two in western Ukraine and two in Eastern Ukraine. In each region, the selected pairs of cities are matched along population and economic variables, but differ drastically in their levels of FDI. This design is particularly strong at approximating the effect of FDI on political attitudes. By comparing individuals within a single country, this research avoids questions about whether country-specific cultural, social or political institutions, rather than FDI, explain observed differences in political attitudes. Furthermore, this design controls for political or geographic variables that influence foreign investors' choice of destination. Thus, this research design allows us to draw more precise causal inferences about the relationship between individuals? exposure to foreign investment and their political preferences over government social policy.
 
This project has broader impacts on long-standing debates in international political economy about the effects of globalization on domestic politics. It makes a unique contribution in assessing the direct effects of foreign investment on citizens, rather than on elites and institutions. In addition, this project measures political attitudes in ""regional"" populations, which are a significant portion of the population in all post-communist countries, yet tend to be underrepresented in national politics and understudied even in area studies.

67,"Dr. Clarence C. Gravlee and Dr. Christopher McCarty will undertake research on the social and cultural influences on racial inequalities in health. Some social scientists view race as a cultural construct, not a biological reality. But this view is coming under increasing scrutiny, as medical researchers seek to explain racial inequalities in health in terms of genetic differences. This development challenges social scientists to clarify how race exists as a social and cultural phenomenon that has force in people's lives and, indeed, one that has biological consequences. 

The driving research question is why African Americans suffer disproportionately from hypertension, or chronic high blood pressure.  This problem is a key test case, because it is often attributed to unknown genetic differences between racially defined groups. This project tests the alternative view that social and cultural factors account for the pattern of hypertension among people of African descent. In particular, it seeks to identify the contributions of social structure and the experience of culturally defined stressors to blood pressure variation among African Americans. The study combines (a) ethnography to explore how class and color shape the meaning of everyday social interaction and (b) methods of social network analysis to examine how the social structure in which individuals are embedded shapes exposure to racism and other social stressors. The research will be conducted among African Americans in Tallahassee, FL, a city with a large and socioeconomically diverse African-American community, as well as a history of racial struggle and civil rights activism. The exploratory phase involves participant observation and two rounds of ethnographic interviewing (N = 48 in each round). The explanatory phase will involve a representative survey (N = 350) of adult African Americans in Tallahassee to test the associations between social network characteristics, the experience of culturally defined stressors, and blood pressure variation, above and beyond known risk factors for high blood pressure.

This study contributes an anthropological perspective to national discussions about race and racism. It develops a novel application of social network analysis and builds on efforts to integrate the social and biological sciences. In particular, it will identify the biological consequences of racism and contribute to our understanding of how social and cultural processes become embodied in health.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,1 UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,GAINESVILLE,US,Gainesville,FL03,University of Florida,FL,326112002,47.075,['Christopher  McCarty'],08/08/2007,969663814,355550,08/31/2012,4900,CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY,365550,0724032,159621697,Clarence C Gravlee,1 UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,GAINESVILLE,US,Gainesville,FL03,University of Florida,FL,326112002,cgravlee@ufl.edu,Clarence,Gravlee,C,3523922253,jmantz@nsf.gov,Jeffrey Mantz,7032927783,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"The goal of this project was to improve understanding of the social and cultural factors that influence poor health among African Americans in the United States. This problem has important implications for public policy and for our understanding of human cultural and biological diversity.  For example, this project developed the idea that apparent biological differences between racially defined groups may be a consequence of social inequalities and experiences of racism, rather than an inevitable result of presumed genetic or inherited difference. This idea promotes a deeper understanding of the interactions between culture and biology, and it expands the range of possible policy approaches to improve health and well-being.

The project was based in Tallahassee, FL, the state capital. Tallahassee is an appropriate setting because it is home to a large and socioeconomically diverse African American community, making it possible to disentangle poverty and non-economic forms of racism. Tallahassee also has a rich history of civil rights activism, which persists in the form of local, community-based efforts to redress racial inequities in health. This context made the work relevant to the public and fostered the development of the Health Equity Alliance of Tallahassee (HEAT), a community-academic partnership between university-based researchers, community-based organizations, state and local government, and concerned citizens. The project also led to a new collaboration among researchers at the University of Florida; supported the training of three graduate students, including one who is using study data in a doctoral dissertation; and created part-time employment for more than a dozen Tallahassee residents.

The project included two main phases that integrated methods from the social and biological sciences. The first phase used qualitative and quantitative ethnographic methods to identify social stressors that are meaningful in the day-to-day experiences of a diverse sample of African Americans. In addition, we used state-of-the-art methods of social network analysis to examine the webs of social relations in which African American participants are embedded. The integration of ethnography and social network analysis helped to identify aspects of everyday racism that are not well captured in predominant approaches to the measurement of racism and discrimination. The grant also supported further development of free, open-source software for collecting personal network data (EgoNet).

The second phase consisted of a community-based, epidemiologic survey with a representative sample of African Americans in Tallahassee (N=268). This survey has four distinctive advantages: (1) It is informed by the first, ethnographic phase, such that questions emerged from and are relevant to peopleÆs day-to-day experiences. This aspect of the survey design increases validity. (2) It is, to our knowledge, one of the largest studies to incorporate extensive measures of personal social network composition and structure among African Americans. (3) It includes an unusually wide array of data about culturally meaningful stressors, coping resources, neighborhood conditions, experiences of racism, perceptions of injustice, and both self-reported and biological measures of health and well-being, including blood pressure and biological markers of stress response. (4) With support from a separate National Science Foundation (NSF) grant (BCS-0820687), we were able to collect DNA samples from survey participants. This synergistic use of NSF funds will enable us to pursue important questions about the interactions between genetic and environmental influences on health and well-being.

70,"The project aims to bridge competency gaps between industry workforce needs and what is provided in a traditional engineering education program. The team is developing a model in which students work on real-world industrial problems that will have a direct bearing on fundamental engineering concepts in all four years of the mechanical engineering program. They are identifying problems that can be broken down into sub-problems and mapped to a selected set of key concepts taught in clusters of core courses. These case problems are being presented under a virtual company framework. Students post their work in the virtual company repository during different stages of the process so that the instructor, industry partners, and other students can view the solutions and procedures and provide periodic feedback.   This is enabling students to learn to assess their own work and that of their peers.   Industry experts meet with students to discuss the pros and cons of the solutions from a real-world perspective. Since the problems span multiple courses, students need to develop the ability to synthesize knowledge acquired from different courses in order to develop complete solutions.

A unique feature of this education strategy is to collaborate with industrial partners to identify real-world problems and integrate these problems in classroom learning by mapping them into key course concepts in the mechanical engineering curriculum.  Students utilize the knowledge and skills they acquired in their course works to solve the problems.  Feedbacks from real-world perspectives are then provided by the industrial partners.

EXPLORES was implemented in two courses (MECH 2060 Manufacturing Processes and MECH 4043 Statistical Methods for Mechanical Engineers) at the University of Cincinnati.  The industrial case problems (provided by General Electrics and TechSolve Inc.) were presented under a virtual company website in order to give students a more realistic working experience.  The evaluation for this project involved formative and summative aspects. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used in conducting evaluation. The formative evaluation was meant to track the progress of the project and implementation of improvements within the project period. A summative evaluation was conducted to determine the extent of the projectÆs success. A quasi-experimental approach with a pre-post survey design using a comparison/control group was used to establish evidence of project effects. The chosen groups (both intervention/EXPLORES and control/traditional classes) were convenient choices; however, the use of explanatory contextual background data was used to check on the threat to internal validity of the comparison between the intervention/EXPLORES and comparison/control groups.

Surveys were conducted to measure the studentsÆ index of learning styles and their learning strategies to better understand how the two groups of students (control and intervention) learned, what motivated them, and what strategies they used in order to learn.  The evaluation produced some interesting findings that are important to guide adoption of the EXPLORES model.  In the Manufacturing Process course, peer learning for the intervention group (EXPLORES) improved compared to the control group (traditional).  However, the intervention group's learning strategy somewhat deteriorated with respect to self-regulation, effect regulation, and study management.  The groupÆs course grade was also lower, although not significantly, than that in the traditional group.  There are two probable causes: (1) the implementation of the EXPLORES did not strictly follow the model design (the instruction mode was predominantly lecture style except the presentation of the case problems); (2) case problems were too complicated for the students.  No significant differences in any other aspects of motivation and learning strategies of these students were detected.  In the Engineering Statistics course, implementation strictly followed model design and case problems were presented in a progressive fashion.  The intervention group showed significant positive post survey results in goal orientation and control of learning beliefs.  The course grade of the intervention group was significantly higher than that of the traditional group.

Intellectual Merit

In this project, econometric methods for analyzing the impact of technological changes on the dynamic of consumer demand have been developed. The proposed dynamic formulation models market evolution, and accounts for consumers' expectations of future product characteristics. The timing of consumers' decisions is formulated as a regenerative optimal stopping problem where the agent must decide on the optimal time of purchase. The modeling framework is further enriched by explicitly considering the consumer's choice from a set of different types of vehicles whose quality changes stochastically over time.

To explore marketplace influences, this project proposed to use a novel stated preference survey design to analyze vehicle purchasing behavior in a dynamically changing marketplace through the use of dynamic attributes and multi-year hypothetical time window. The designs correspond to changing vehicle technology, fueling options, and taxation policy. Between scenarios, the vehicle, fuel, and policy attributes dynamically change to mimic marketplace conditions. Data collected showed that respondents responded in behaviorally realistically ways and that the survey design allowed for estimation of important parameters in vehicle choice.  Respondents were able to depreciate their vehicles over the hypothetical period and place tradeoffs on the features of vehicles and fuel types. 

The modeling framework has been intensively tested using simulated and real data. In both cases, results show that dynamic models are superior to static models based on multinomial logit; in particular, they are able to recover peaks in the demand evolution over time, while static models fail to detect dramatic changes due to the rapid mutation of external conditions.

Broader Impacts

The project has played an important role in the creation of an international and multi-disciplinary program in transportation demand modeling. Students involved in the research program and those attending the classes developed under this project have been trained in dynamic and stochastic programming concepts, advanced statistics and optimization methods. This has increased the multi-disciplinary capabilities of the students and generated collaboration projects with the Department of Mathematics at the University of Maryland and the Department of Informatics at the University of Montreal (CA). Women and an Afro-American student have been directly involved in this project; after graduation they have undertaken careers in the transportation field and they have been offered positions in prestigious academic institutions and in State and Federal Agencies.

The PI has been involved by the Department of Energy (DOE) on research related to vehicle type, new technology vehicle adoption and integrated models for vehicle ownership. This research is relevant for the future of our society and for the definition of policies that will affect the life of citizens in developed and developing countries. This has been possible thanks to the results obtained under this project and to the experience cumulated while working with advanced methods on car ownership.

Several events have been organized to disseminate the developed techniques and the obtained results. Two seminars have been hosted at the University of Maryland; well known academicians and agency representatives have agreed to give their contributions and an international audience has attended both events.

72,"The project will conduct a mapping study to describe the contexts, characteristics and practices of a national sample of science-focused Out-of-School Time (OST) programs and identify exemplar programs for further study.  A Field Study will seek more detailed knowledge about these programs by interviewing participants, alumni, and other stakeholders, and observing program activities. The results of these studies will be presented at a working conference at the end of the project to discuss how to develop a survey instrument to measure important youth outcomes from OST programs and collect baseline data for an anticipated longitudinal study. 

This project will provide new descriptive materials about the operation and practice of the out of school learning of science. It will produce a literature review, a list of organizations that provide out of school science training and a plan for future data collection. A qualitative study will be conducted to answer questions such as to what extent OST science experiences spark interest or rather nurture or sustain it and how these outcomes fit within the broader context of lifelong learning and development. The study is intended to create a new typology of youth OST science programs that sufficiently describe crucial features that differentiate such programs.",NSF,4900,"REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO, THE","3100 Marine Street, Room 481",Boulder,US,Boulder,CO02,University of Colorado at Boulder,CO,803031058,47.076,['Heather L Thiry'],08/20/2010,007431505,293895,11/30/2014,4900,AISL,293895,1010953,007431505,Sandra L Laursen,"3100 Marine Street, Room 481",Boulder,US,Boulder,CO02,University of Colorado at Boulder,CO,803031058,sandra.laursen@colorado.edu,Sandra,Laursen,L,3037352942,emccalli@nsf.gov,Ellen McCallie,7032925115,040106 NSF Education & Human Resource,"This study, Mapping Out-of-School-Time Science (MOST-Science), has sought to build a broad national picture of out-of-school-time (OST) science, engineering and technology (SET) programs for young people.  These programs are widely thought to engage youth interest in science, develop useful academic and life skills, build confidence and a positive identity, and foster positive life and career paths such as school completion and college study of SET. Yet  before it is even possible to measure and compare youth outcomes resulting from diverse program models, we need good descriptions of the characteristics of these programs that may be important. This kind of information also helps to determine the extent to which youth have access to these experiences; where gaps are identified, we can identify local and national opportunities to deepen and broaden access.

 

To answer these questions, we have gathered data through documents, interviews, and the online MOST-Science Questionnaire. We focused on intensive programs lasting more than one session because these are expected to best contribute to positive youth outcomes and to broad national goals such as increasing the size and diversity of the SET workforce. Documents and questionnaire responses from 417 programs nation-wide provide factual information about program aims, design, and audiences, while 53 interviews with program directors and other leaders provide detail on programs' rationale and methods.  Together these data sources offer a rich picture of the types of programs that serve youth, the various ways they are organized and supported, and the curricular features they include.

 

We analyzed the data by the type of organization that hosted the youth OST program.  Organizations with strong expertise in both science and education&mdash;such as museums and science centers, aquariums, zoos, and universities&mdash;tended to offer programs with positive features such as high contact hours for youth and fee structures that supported youth access.  They were well networked and well funded, and staff were more often trained in science.  Nonprofit organizations and national youth organizations showed different strengths; they tended to reach more diverse youth audiences, and many also targeted girls.  As a group, they were less well funded but used scholarships to enable youth access; however, their staffs less often included people with science backgrounds.  These features may be typical of organizations that emphasize positive youth development.

 

Comparing these features highlights the potential for mutually beneficial partnerships between organizations of different types&mdash;for example, a partnership that might meld the scientific resources of a museum with the ability of a local nonprofit to reach underserved students of color, or draw upon university outreach to provide programming to local and regional chapters of a national youth organization.

 

Our data set shows strength among programs for girls, which may suggest that efforts to encourage girls in science are finally bearing fruit, giving girls more opportunities to experience science in supportive out-of-school learning venues. But other results point to unfilled niches.  For example, programs for gifted and talented youth are relatively common, but there is a distinct lack of programs targeting youth with disabilities. We encourage organizations to form creative partnerships and funders to develop new initiatives, especially to engage these underserved groups.

 

We also looked at the relationship between the features of the programs and the diversity of the youth participants they served.  Many programs appeared to deliver high-quality programming that provided immersive experiences for youth and that used inquiry learning and practices that promote youth development and growth into capable adults. Encouragingly, programs that served high proportions of underrepresented minority youth and girls often showed ...",,"['Laursen, S.

Optimization of a variety of observational platforms and different types of observations were analyzed. The major scientific findings of the project research are as follows:

The project research confirmed that the developed technique has a strong potential for the optimization of the existing and incoming observational programs in the Arctic Ocean and should be adopted for the planning and post-processing of the collected observations. This will allow significant savings of limited financial resources and ship time and maximize informational content of collected in situ observations.  

The project research demonstrated that in some cases the developed technique can be applied for optimization of the observational systems using the existing (previously reconstructed climatological or seasonal) circulations in the Arctic Ocean. The developed algorithms have been incorporated into the web-server and become available for practically any qualified user. These web-servers are designed for optimization with respect to previously known (e.g. climatological) regional circulations. This is reasonable for long-term observation system planning (such as mooring deployment and HFR installation sites), but a one-time survey optimization system would require the results of an operational circulation model.

Integrating this research with education presents an opportunity to explain galaxy formation to undergraduate students.  These students are motivated to learn about current research but require hands-on interaction to visualize challenging concepts such as dark matter ""halos"" and galaxy ""merger trees"".  To this end, the PI will develop a new version of Rutgers University's introductory astronomy course, replacing half of the lectures with interactive computer visualization laboratories to improve students' conceptual understanding. The PI will teach this class each year, using standard assessment methods to measure effectiveness.

This integrated program of research and education will have several broader impacts.  It promises to improve understanding of galaxy formation by connecting the observable universe of galaxies to the invisible halos of dark matter that host them.  Several undergraduates, two Ph.D. thesis students, a postdoctoral researcher, and an educational researcher supervised by the PI will be trained for their own careers in research and education.  Results of the educational experiment will be published to allow successful techniques to be implemented at other institutions.

Major research breakthroughs included the following:  1) We discovered that an important type of galaxies called ""Lyman Alpha Emitters"" (LAEs) have higher rates of new star formation at a given mass compared to typical galaxies, implying that they are undergoing unusually strong bursts of star formation.   2) We studied how galaxies assembled in the Millenium-II cosmological simulation and found that half of the LAEs evolve into typical present-day galaxies like the Milky Way but the other half become satellite galaxies like the Magellanic Clouds.   3) We found that distant dwarf galaxies are much bluer than nearby dwarf galaxies.  4) We introduced a method for replacing uncertain properties in galaxy formation models with proxies and used this to successfully model the properties of so-called sub-millimeter galaxies.   5) We developed a Bayesian statistical method to identify and remove contamination from the sample of &gt;1 million emission line galaxies to be discovered by the Hobby Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX).  6) We demonstrated that the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope can use large telescope offsets (called dithers) to reduce dark energy systematics by a factor of ten.  7)  We performed the first statistically consistent search for intrinsic scatter in the distribution of distant galaxies' star formation rates versus their (stellar) masses and reported the amplitude and evolution of this scatter, finding an important conflict with predictions of galaxy formation simulations.  8)  We pioneered the Dense Basis Method for reconstructing the star formation histories of distant galaxies from their observed broad-band photometry (colors) and used it to determine the fraction of those galaxies that experienced more than one major episode of star formation.  





Broader Impacts:  The Dense Basis Method has broad applicability in data science, as it provides a general approach to reconstructing histories from single-epoch observations.  PI Gawiser and Research Scientist Kurczynski gave several public lectures during the time period of this grant, and Gawiser led annual trips to Hayden Planetarium for the Rutgers Astronomical Society (astrophysics majors) and Rutgers Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program.  Five Ph.D. thesis students were involved in the project.  Four of these Ph.D. students led at least one refereed publication supported by the grant.  One of them graduated and moved onto a postdoctoral research position; another graduated and moved to a data science job at Amazon; three are currently writing their dissertations.  This includes a dissertation through the Rutgers Graduate School of Education (GSE) advised by GSE Prof. Eugenia Etkina and co-advised by PI Gawiser that reports the results of research on improving conceptual understanding of introductory astrophysics by Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) majors in Gawiser?s classes.  Rutgers undergraduate students mentored by PI Gawiser played a major role in the research, with refereed publications led by four of them.  Additional undergraduates co-authored their first journal publication, gave research talks at scientific conferences, led poster presentations at American Astronomical Society meetings, or obtained their initial research experience.  Of the eighteen students involved in research supported by this grant, ten are women, four are Latinos, and two are non-traditional students; five of the undergraduates are now in Ph.D. programs.  The PI?s identification and mentoring of talented students has expanded and diversified both the field of Astrophysics and the United States' STEM workforce.

77,"The recent discovery of dozens of luminous quasars at redshifts greater than six from multi-band surveys indicates the existence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of a billion solar masses when the universe was less than one billion years old.  These frontier observations present a big challenge to theoretical models.  The present researchers have developed a set of physically motivated multi-scale cosmological simulations for the formation of redshift six quasars, which pave the way for studying black holes and galaxies in the early universe.  The current project will improve these models and use them to further two goals, first, by following the formation and evolution of the first SMBHs dynamically, performing multi-scale cosmological radiation-hydro simulations including gas dynamics and black hole growth, and second, by predicting their observable properties through post-processing multi-wavelength radiative transfer, and gravitational radiation calculations from possible mergers.  The study will shed new light on three outstanding questions: 1) what were the black hole seeds? 2) did the first SMBHs co-evolve with their host galaxies? and 3) what are their observational properties?

Numerical advances that will be generally available to other scientists include the implementation of realistic accretion physics in two cosmological codes widely used throughout the community, and the addition of carbon monoxide line transfers to another widely used code.  The results will be extremely useful both for current observations and for future surveys.  The anticipated research results will inform and enlighten the principal investigator's teaching and outreach activities at her home institution, and are likely to be used for public education nationwide, continuing an existing involvement with the American Museum of Natural History and the Discovery Channel.",NSF,4900,"PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY, THE",110 Technology Center Building,UNIVERSITY PARK,US,University Park,PA05,Pennsylvania State Univ University Park,PA,168027000,47.049,,09/20/2010,003403953,245225,09/30/2014,4900,EXTRAGALACTIC ASTRON & COSMOLO,245225,1009867,003403953,Yuexing C Li,110 Technology Center Building,UNIVERSITY PARK,US,University Park,PA05,Pennsylvania State Univ University Park,PA,168027000,YUL20@psu.edu,Yuexing,Li,C,8148672291,nsharp@nsf.gov,Nigel Sharp,7032924905,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"This project aimed to study the formation, evolution and observational signatures of the first massive black holes by combining multi-scale cosmological simulations with multi-wavelength radiative transfer calculations. The questions we aimed to address are: What were the black hole seeds of the earliest quasars? Did the first massive black holes co-evolve with their host galaxies? What were their multi-band properties? How did the first quasars impact the cosmic reionization and structure formation at later times?

Over the course of this project, we have developed or improved a number of physical models and numerical codes for realistic astrophysical simulations, and have brought galaxy modeling to the next level by combing multi-scale cosmological simulations and multi-wavelength radiative transfer calculations. The project has provided new insights into a number of outstanding problems, such as formation, evolution and multi-band properties of the first galaxies and black holes, and the puzzles of the Milky Way, as shown in the supplementary documents of research highlights.  These results are expected to have a significant impact in fields of galaxy formation and cosmology and beyond.

To date, this award has fully or partially supported the research training of one undergrad, two graduate students, and two postdocs, and has produced 17 papers, of which 8 published, 6 under review, and 3 in preparation. 

We presented the results at astronomical conferences such as the AAS meetings and international conferences, seminars and colloquia at a number of institutions, Penn State in-service Workshops for middle- and high-school teachers, and public outreach events such as the AstroFest at Penn State. All the code developments and implementations, simulation data, images and animations, and scientific results were made publicly available.

78,"Unemployment represents one of the most significant stressors that people can encounter in their working lives. Previous research has shown that unemployment can have a serious impact on an individual's physical and mental well-being. However, there are significant differences from one individual to the next with respect to coping strategies during job loss. A related strand of research has looked at what aspects of searching for employment are most difficult and what intervention strategies are most useful for individuals seeking new employment opportunities. In this project, the researchers will bring together these different strands of inquiry to develop a cross-national investigation of the key determinants, processes, and outcomes of self-regulation during unemployment. National labor departments and international agencies have sought ways to shorten the time of unemployment in order to minimize monetary and mental health costs to individuals. Governments spend millions of dollars/euros annually on services for unemployed individuals, and rely on academic information to help them design effective services. Research that can help to understand the problems individuals have in their job search and interventions designed to help individuals speed a sustainable reemployment success are highly important. 

The data will be collected in a five-wave longitudinal design from job seekers in the Netherlands, U.S., and Germany. This large scale project will provide important insight into how unemployment insurance systems interact with individual characteristics to promote or deter job search activity on the part of individuals. Accompanying projects in this grant similarly expand current knowledge in significant ways, aiming in particular at understanding the reasons behind (and solutions for) unintentional (as well as intentional) procrastination and lack of persistence in the job search process.  Subproject 1 will integrate macro-level (systems-based, economic) with micro-level (individual, psychological) perspectives by investigating to what extent system-based Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits plays a role in unemployed individuals' job search, mental health and quality of reemployment (finding a suitable job). Subproject 2 will examine unemployed individuals' self-regulatory responses to setbacks and rejections. Subproject 3 will focus on job seekers' career adaptability as a form of proactive coping with job loss. Subproject 4 will take a refined look at the causes, content, dynamics, and outcomes of procrastination as an important form of self-regulatory failure.",NSF,4900,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,200 OAK ST SE,Minneapolis,US,Minneapolis,MN05,University of Minnesota-Twin Cities,MN,554552070,47.075,,06/07/2014,555917996,299424,05/31/2018,4900,European Open Research Area,299424,1420046,006220594,Connie R Wanberg,321 19th Ave S,Minneapolis,US,Minneapolis,MN05,"Carlson School of Mgmt, University of MN",MN,554550438,wanbe001@umn.edu,Connie,Wanberg,R,6126244804,bhumes@nsf.gov,Brian D. Humes,7032927284,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Millions of individuals are unemployed each year. This research aimed to assist job seekers and inform unemployment insurance policy.

In one aspect of this research, we identified three aspects of networking (self-efficacy, use, and benefits) that many individuals need assistance with during a job search. To assist job seekers with these aspects of networking, we developed a theory-based intervention (BRIO; Building Relationships and Improving Opportunities). We tested the effectiveness of this intervention among 545 unemployed job seekers, using a field experimental design with an intervention group and two control groups. Results demonstrate that (1) job seekers who completed the intervention had higher levels of networking self-efficacy, use, and benefits as compared to job seekers in the control groups; (2) the intervention resulted in higher reemployment quality through its positive effects on networking self-efficacy; and (3) the intervention was more effective for improving networking self-efficacy and reemployment quality for individuals lower on baseline networking self-efficacy.

A second part of our project was focused on how unemployment insurance affects unemployed individuals? job search. We examined the extent to which perceived unemployment insurance (UI) adequacy during unemployment has important cognitive, behavioral, and reemployment consequences. Our study involved a four-wave survey design of 1,655 job seekers looking for work in three different countries (United States, Germany, and the Netherlands). Results indicate that perceived UI generosity is associated with reduced job-search time pressure and priority, which related to lower job-search intensity and slower reemployment speed. At the same time perceived UI generosity related to increased reemployment quality through its positive relation with mental health.

79,"Researchers at Spelman College and Winston Salem State University propose to explore identity shifting among Black women from a psychological perspective. Prior research has shown that identity shifting is a coping strategy that Black women use to mitigate the negative experiences of discrimination, and most of these studies have used a quantitative approach or a communication perspective. Thus, the study will expand the psychological literature on identity shifting to focus on Black women in STEM education. The proposed project involves two sets of studies, and the researchers will use a survey method approach to examine identity shifting. Two studies in Set 1 will test the validity and reliability of a new tool for measuring identity shifting among Black women undergraduate and graduate STEM students.  Set II will conduct a daily diary study based on the results of Set I to explore the experiences of discrimination and identity shifting. The research is expected to inform interventions to increase and broaden participation of Black women in STEM education and the workforce.

The specific study objectives are to (1) validate a measurement of identity shifting for Black women undergraduate and graduate STEM students and (2) explore the daily experiences in graduate school of discrimination and identity shifting among Black women STEM students. The primary theoretical frameworks utilized in the research include Black feminist thought and phenomenological variant of ecological systems theory (PVES). This framework posits that a Black woman?s identity is shaped by her experiences and that she simultaneously aspires to make sense of her identities. Intersectionality serves as a basis for the present study. A survey design will be used to answer the following research questions: (1) How relevant, reliable, and valid is the new Identity Shifting Scale for Black women? (2) Can the Identity Shifting for Black Women Scale provide adequate sub-scales resulting from factor analysis testing? (3) When compared with the identity management, stigma consciousness, gendered racism, acculturation, and stereotype expectations and concerns, does the Identity Shifting Scale for Black Women have convergent validity (how well the scale relates to other related measures)? How does discrimination, interpersonal contact anxiety, positive interactions, and support influence identity shifting processes among Black women STEM graduate students?  Through the survey design approach, Black women students' experiences of identity shifting will be captured.

80,"General Abstract
This proposal studies how advanced democracies help or hinder the integration of immigrants.  It seeks to identify when, how, and under what circumstances individual immigrants acquire positive attitudes toward democratic values, institutions, and toward the receiving country.  This is a topic of great importance, as it is clear that not all immigrants adopt pro-democratic values, as evident by instances of hostility on the part of immigrants directed at the receiving country.  The project will study refugees in order to assess their attitudes toward the host country upon their arrival, and then subsequently track the respondents' attitudes over time.  With an increasing number of individuals seeking to flee their home countries to move to advanced democracies, the topic is timely and important. By assessing how immigrants acquire (or fail to acquire) pro-democracy attitudes, the research is poised to help determine strategies to help integrate the new arrivals into democratic society.  Successful programs that foster integration can help to reduce the negative consequences often associated with large influxes of refugees. Those findings would be of great values to both the scholarly and policymaking communities.

This proposal studies how, when, and why some immigrants successfully integrate into democratic societies, while others do not.  The research design allows for the investigators to evaluate the immigrant respondents' attitudes toward democracy upon arriving in the receiving country, and subsequently at multiple points over time.  Unlike previous studies, the team is able to study refugees fleeing a specific country, but who ultimately end up dispersed across multiple advanced democratic countries. This will allow the team to assess how different conditions across countries may contribute to the successful integration of immigrants and the adoption of pro-democratic values by these immigrants.  To do so, the team will utilize state-of-the-art cellular technology, an experimental research design, and a panel data survey design to assess the success or failure of host states to integrate newly arrived immigrants.  By identifying factors that contribute to successful integration efforts that foster democratic values among newly arrived immigrants, this research will provide valuable insights to scholars who study civic values and political socialization.

82,"Greater willingness to help is an important source of assistance to victims of natural disasters such as hurricanes. Such willingness may translate into immediate desire to help (e.g., donate money) as well as the long-term propensity to support policies contributing to disaster mitigation and adaptation (at a possible cost to tax-payers). Willingness to help, however, may be a product of complex interaction between individual socioeconomic status, demographic characteristics, psychological attributes, political ideology, and beliefs about the issue of climate change. Moreover, the rally effect may be short-term for some but long-term for others. Understanding the complexity of this relationship may increase efficiency of social mobilization to help victims of natural disasters and contribute to greater environmental awareness and support for natural disaster preparedness in general. The investigator proposes to conduct a two-wave survey of public opinion on a nationally representative sample of adults in the United States. The goal of the survey is to examine respondents' reactions to hurricanes (specifically, Hurricane Harvey) and analyze how individual attitudes and willingness to help change over time.

Previously, scholars suggested investigating the time course of reactions to natural disasters but the temporal dimension of public opinion in the context of hurricanes and other such disasters remains largely unexplored. The proposed survey design examines possible deterioration of empathetic concern for victims of the disaster in the context of individual ideological preferences (e.g., liberal or conservative), partisan/political identification, psychological traits (e.g., perspective taking, social desirability bias), behavioral propensities (e.g., risk preferences, future discounting), and social environment (e.g., existence of tangible social support). An important goal of the project is to establish under which conditions helping behavior is most stable and under which it is most fragile and short-lived. Previous research has shown that willingness to help increases if responsibility for disasters could be attributed to human actions (e.g., government), not natural phenomena (which traditionally included hurricanes). Therefore, greater attribution of hurricanes to anthropogenic climate change has a potential to promote helping behavior and environmental support in general.

D-Ready will use contemporary machine learning techniques to process and filter the data the team will collate regarding such areas as choice preferences. The proposed technology will be deployed with two goals in mind.  A survey design methodology will be used to help ensure that decision-selection guidelines are unbiased for individual user. This is important because the more unbiased the decision support product, the more widely it will be trusted and used. The team will also use cursor-tracking technology to develop an in-depth statistical picture of how individual users view decision-support site-apps. This will allow for the team to use nonlinear regression and classification methods to segment users into distinct types. The insights learned from these analyses will be valuable to support decision makers in a broad range of applications. Applying the customer discovery process during the I-Corps curriculum, the team intends to come up with a more complete value proposition that it will provide and refine the product features that will be most useful.


D-Ready is envisioned as an online and mobile decision support guide that creates customized information for users that is simple, convenient and unbiased.

Through this project, BallotReady sought to assist voters in making decisions all the way down the ballot and increase voter turnout.

BallotReady began by interviewing 100 voters about their voting habits, sources of information, and civic engagement. Our interviews validated the central problem. Most voters enter the voting booth prepared to vote for president but unprepared for everything else. As a result, voters told us that they guess or left blanks. Some voters also said that they didn't vote in local elections because they didn't understand the ballot.

Our broader take-away based on this research was that voters lacked a coherent schema for making sense of local politics. While civically-engaged voters can compare candidates at the federal level based on traditional categories - left wing, right wing, Democrat, Republican - those terms often did not apply to nonpartisan or municipal offices. For instance, voters in Chicago were asked to choose between a field of all Democrats where cleavages between candidates and sides were much more opaque.

BallotReady used the results of this research to build a pilot online voter guide for the Kentucky election. We had over 13,000 voters come to the site and we gained valueable insight into how we could improve our platform.

Over the following 6 months, we continued to iterate with voter guides for the Illinois, Colorado, Maryland, and Kentucky primaries. In the fall of 2016, we launched in 12 states, covering 15,000 candidates and with over 1 million visits to our site.

85,"Although Hispanics and Blacks make up 17% and 13% of the U.S. population, members of these groups comprised only 9% and 7% of medical school enrollees in 2013, respectively. While a portion of this trend can be attributed to recent declines in affirmative action programs across a number of states, it has also been suggested that the potential pool of minority applicants is diminished due to academic and interpersonal experiences on college campuses that ultimately discourage these students from pursuing careers in medicine. This study interrogates how cumulative changes in social resources (social support, social networks, and network-related material resources) at both the interpersonal and institutional level influence students' experiences of psychological distress and burnout, and contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in premedical attrition.  

Existing research on the trajectories of premedical students of color has relied on cross-sectional survey data and institutional records limited to cursory information on students' sociodemographic characteristics, SAT scores, and grades in required coursework. Despite the utility of this information for examining academic trajectories, these data are insufficient for understanding how interpersonal and social structural factors contribute to leaks in the premedical pipeline. In order to identify where this drop off occurs and why it happens, the proposed research addresses previous methodological constraints by employing a longitudinal survey design, in tandem with in-depth interviews, to create a fuller understanding of the dynamic and complex social processes that shape premedical retention. This research holds the promise of addressing inequities in educational opportunities that pose serious consequences for projected healthcare shortages in the United States. Given the consistent finding that underrepresented minority group members who go on to medical school are significantly more likely than their peers to practice in underserved inner-city areas, these educational disparities have direct consequences for projected shortages in medical care.",NSF,4900,TRUSTEES OF INDIANA UNIVERSITY,509 E 3RD ST,Bloomington,US,Bloomington,IN09,Indiana University,IN,474013654,47.075,['Matthew  Grace'],04/14/2015,006046700,9984,07/31/2016,4900,SOCIOLOGY,9984,1519056,006046700,Bernice A Pescosolido,509 E 3RD ST,Bloomington,US,Bloomington,IN09,Indiana University,IN,474013654,pescosol@indiana.edu,Bernice,Pescosolido,A,8128553841,pwhite@nsf.gov,Patricia White,7032928762,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Despite an early focus on medical training and the formation of the medical student sub-culture, over the course of the past thirty years sociologists have largely neglected the study of medical education. Much of what we know about premedical students&ndash;what the average student looks like, who persists, and what derails their pursuit&ndash;comes from non-sociological areas of inquiry. To address this gap in the literature, this project sought to examine the relationships among social integration, mental health, and premedical attrition, with a particular focus on the experiences of studens of color and those from lower-income and working class backgrounds.

Survey data for the project were collected from freshman and sophomore premedical students at a large research university at the start of the fall semester (n=392), and a follow-up interview was conducted with these same students at the close of the academic year (n=283). In addition, in-depth interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of students who were interviewed at both time points (n=39) during the summer. 

Longitudinal analyses aimed at understanding the relationships among social integration, mental health, and premedical persistence indicate that a variety of financial, interpersonal, and academic stressors intensify premedical students? experiences of psychological distress and burnout. These deleterious mental health outcomes, in turn, exacerbate the likelihood that respondents will depart from the premedical track. Contrary to study expectations, with the exception of increasing premedical homophily (i.e., egocentric networks with a higher proportion of premedical peers over time), no other social relationship measure operates directly on premedical attrition. Rather, changes in social network composition reduce premedical attrition by moderating the negative consequences that psychological distress and burnout pose for premedical attrition.

 Despite a focus on students of color and students from low-income and working class backgrounds, study data provide no evidence that these students are any more likely than their more privileged counterparts to leave the premedical track. Consistent with past research, however, enduring gender disparities in premedical attrition were detected, with female premedical students approximately four times more likely to leave the premedical track than their male counterparts. Structural factors&mdash;namely, more frequent self-reports of sex-based discrimination&mdash;were associated with women?s higher levels of psychological distress and networks composed of fewer premedical peers compared to male premeds. Taken together, these factors explain a modest proportion (~25%) of the gender gap in premedical persistence.

But while quantitative analyses shed light on key mechanisms that disadvantage women, they alone do not tell the whole story. Emergent themes from interview data indicate that female premeds are more likely than their male counterparts to experience sexism both in and out of the classroom, and to voice recurring fears about their personal safety on campus. Consonant with research on the social epidemiology of stress, women are also more likely than men to report an additional stress burden via close relationships with family members and friends. Across interviews, women were considerably more likely to report providing support to network members undergoing mental health crises, college transfers, unexpected pregnancies, and recovery from sexual assault. The cumulative effects of these stressors fuel self-doubts about medical school admission and erode mental health among women, which ultimately leads to their pursuit of alternative career paths&mdash;more often than not, in lower paying, lower status healthcare occupations (e.g., nursing, physical therapy). 

The results of this project provide insights into mechanisms that account for the disproportionate attrition of women from the premedical track, and more broadly, speak to intervention strategies that universities can undertake to retain a higher proportion of their premedical students. The finding that increases in the number of premedical peers that compose one's social networks reduces likelihood of premedical attrition adds further nuance to our understanding of the concept of ""homophily."" To date, sociological research on this concept has discussed homophily (""birds of a feather flock together"") as exacerbating stratification along racial, gendered, and socioeconomic lines. The findings of this research underscore the importance of ""similar others"" in the achievement of academic success, and highlight the positive aspects of this network characteristic. These findings suggest that programs which foster camraderie among premedical students, and those which advocate the importance of collaboration over competition will be useful for retaining early career premedical students--especially female premedical students. Such findings have the potential to be applied across all STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) disciplines for which the retention of women remains paramount.

86,"Phil Wannamaker from the University of Utah is producing and interpreting a high-quality section view of electrical resistivity structure through the central and western Great Basin, and the southeastern Modoc Plateau. This is being achieved by the addition of 55 wideband magnetotelluric soundings to an existing transect of 179 sites, plus installation of 35 long-period magnetotelluric soundings, to create a transect some 650 km in length span-ning Nevada and northeastern California into westernmost Utah. The magnetotelluric station data will span the range of 0.005 to 10,000 second wave periods, with corresponding imag-ing depths from a few hundred meters to  about 300 km, and perhaps greater. The profiling covers fully 100 kilometers of the Modoc Plateau, the actively extending northwestern Great Basin, the Central Nevada Seismic Belt, the relatively quiescent east-central Great Basin of higher elevation, and onlaps the active eastern Great Basin of western Utah. These data are undergoing modern methods of processing, trend analysis, and regularized inversion to pro-duce a well-resolved model with minimal artifacts. The overall goal of the project is to im-prove our understanding of the process of distributed continental rifting. The consequences of rifting can be profound, including the potential for large earthquakes, development of sedimentary basins and, ultimately, breakup of continents to form new ocean basins. Many important hydrocarbon, geothermal and mineral resource occurrences can arise from the structural, magmatic and hydrothermal processes involved in extension. The project specifi-cally is addressing first-order problems regarding vertical strain distribution, magmatic crustal growth, domains of crustal scale fluid flow, and coupling between the lithosphere and asthenosphere remain unsolved. These include the prevalence of crustal scale fault zones which host the largest earthquakes; under what circumstances upper and lower-crustal thin-ning are decoupled; where mantle lithosphere is weak or strong during rifting; whether volumetrically significant magmatic input occurs during the early to middle stages of conti-nental rifting; and how mantle-sourced fluids make their way to the shallow ground water regime. The project also addresses societal benefits including broader understanding of the controls on fault strength, crustal scale hydrology, and the ability to build up damaging stresses. The link between deep geothermal systems and epithermal gold deposits is being illuminated as well. A graduate student is being supported for education into state of the art geophysical instrumentation, parameters of field survey design, practical logistical matters in remote settings, modern methods of inversion, and the relationship between electrical resis-tivity and physico-chemical state in the Earth.

The resistivity cross section over this depth range was produced from the measured EM field data using the process of regularized non-linear inversion based upon the finite element simulation method. Regularization in this context is a term which means to produce an earth model which simultaneously fits the observed data while also suppressing model artifacts not demanded by the data.

The wide depth range over which an earth model can be produced allow us to examine the relationship of resistivity structure to thermo-tectonic processes connecting magmatic source regions through crustal residence to geothermal systems near the surface. From the California-Nevada border eastward to the Wasatch Front of Utah, the transect shows that the Great Basin crust is a broken crust. Numerous high-angle crustal conductors connect tabular areas of apparent magmatic underplating in the lower crust (similar to Modoc Plateau above) to high-temperature geothermal systems near surface. Follow-up 3D MT surveys at some of these crustal breaks supported by the U.S. Dept of Energy/GTO have verified the correlation of the structures and further confirmed the magmatic relationship through establishment of 3He/4He anomalies in the geothermal fluids.

    The western portion of the transect across northern California received particular attention as it cross the southernmost extent of the Cascadia subduction system including Lassen Peak arc volcano and the back-arc Southern Modoc Plateau. This cross section was compared to those further north in Oregon and Washington states and southern British Columbia in a major publication first-authored by Wannamaker in the AGU journal G-Cubed in December, 2014. The section here shows a highly resistive Gorda Plate near the coast with no conductor associated with the subduction slip plane. This is in contrast to the EMSLAB Oregon transect where a subduction channel is interpreted also from offshore seismic surveying, but similar to the CAFE Washington transect. Both Gorda and CAFE segments show substantial seismicity in the coastal areas in both lower and upper plates and the resistivity structure implies fluid poor conditions conducive to stress buildup and brittle failure.

Further inland, the Gorda section shows a sudden bloom of low resistivity right where the plate interface takes a dive and eclogite formation/fluid release is inferred. This also is the location of a cluster of low-frequency earthquakes. A modest low-resistivity axis is associated with Lassen Peak and also with the Lt Cz volcanic trend through the Southern Modoc Plateau. Considerable Moho-level magmatic underplating there is inferred from the resistivity structure also.

The long period NIMS instruments used in this project were owned by the University of Washington under the direction of Prof. John R. Booker, now transitioned to the NGF at OSU (A. Schultz, P.I.). U Utah graduate students Virginie Maris (now a post-doc) and Marie Green were trained in and operated their use.

88,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the improvement of patient outcomes in long-term care facilities. As America ages, the need for effective care of the elderly becomes more pressing, with more than 50000 facilities caring for more than 3.5 million patients at any one time. This I-Corps project can lead to the adoption of the new decision-making technology that incorporates unique predictive algorithms to help management teams in long-term care facilities maximize the information from their currently collected safety and clinical data. By adopting this new technology, management teams will be able to predict where there may be deficiencies, prioritize key drivers associated with specific patient outcomes, and prevent adverse events. The new technology can be adopted as a cloud based information and data delivery system.

This I-Corps project supports customer discovery of an innovation using a unique predictive modeling algorithm that identifies key drivers of specific patient outcomes and produces meaningful benchmarks for each driver that management teams can use to guide quality improvement efforts. The algorithm determines where a facility is on each key driver in relation to each benchmark and produces a prioritized list of actions needed for continuous improvement. The algorithm provides a stable framework for improvement that is not sensitive to data imperfections and does not allow those imperfections to distract decision-making from real priorities. The algorithm was developed based on extensive research and practice of applying the Rasch model and objective standard-setting process in different settings, including health, psychology and transportation. The most extensive of these applications were the development of rigorous risk and defensibility assessments for long-term care facilities and hospitals, and the development of differentiation algorithms for passenger experience in the airline industry.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO, THE","2801 W Bancroft St., MS 218",TOLEDO,US,Toledo,OH09,University of Toledo,OH,436063390,47.041,['Fox  Christine'],03/28/2017,051623734,50000,04/30/2018,4900,I-Corps,50000,1735683,051623734,Svetlana  Beltyukova,2801 W.

While our team ended up being a ""No Go"" even after the award extension period, we continue to work on our business model canvas and use business connections that we developed through the program. One of such connections was with a business mentor of another team with whom we have been exploring new customer segments, and we are not afraid to pivot. The I-Corps program was also instrumental for our understanding and experience of the market-pull instead of the product-push approach to small business development. When taking to customers, we are better able to focus on and verbalize the value for the customer as well as strategize customer retention and growth. We also understand from talking to other enterpreneurs that it is possible to find your niche even ina busy space.

The I-Corps program have also impacted professionally both PI?s of the team who teach doctoral levels courses in Research Design and Survey Design. Both PI?s have successfully incorporated the ""boot camp"" approach to developing studies and surveys with high-pressure immediate feedback to students in real time and quick turn around time. It was great, although exhausting, to experience the teaching strategies employed by the I-Corps instructors while being on the receiving end.

89,"The University of New Mexico CREST Center for Water and the Environment will investigate technological solutions to problems with water and the environment, and will focus on water problems in arid environments and in times of drought, including those associated with deteriorating watersheds, climate change, water needs for energy development, and technologies to address these challenges. These issues are critical to the Southwestern U.S. but also have global importance. This center will attract underrepresented minorities into STEM careers.  Recruitment, retention, and graduation of underrepresented minorities are an integral feature of the Center. Innovative programs in this Center will include construction of a water technology demonstration trailer with hands-on water activities for K-12 students, a water competition, recruiting at regional minority-serving colleges and junior colleges, as well as mentoring and tutoring programs. The research component is organized around four topics: watershed processes, water treatment technologies, water/energy interactions, and research integration. The Watershed Subproject focuses on how watershed management affects hydrologic processes, ecosystem services, and the consequent quantity and quality of water available to downstream users. The Treatment Technology Subproject investigates technologies for the removal of nutrients, trace pollutants, and emerging contaminants to minimize anthropogenic impacts to water supplies and maximize use of impaired and low-quality waters for different uses. The Water/Energy Subproject examines water resource impacts from oil, gas, and uranium development and identifies strategies to minimize them. These three topics are intrinsically related because of the hydrologic connection of surface and ground water resources, and the need to protect, conserve, and put every drop to beneficial use. These relationships will be investigated in the fourth topic, the Research Integration Subproject. This topic will develop strategies to support decision-making processes by considering uncertainty, social, economic, policy and legal factors.

Intellectual Merit:
This Center will generate significant new knowledge about the management and treatment of water in arid and semi-arid environments. It will have regional and global consequences as climate change and population growth cause a decrease in water supplies. Greater understanding of the impacts of historical watershed management practices and the effect of improved watershed management strategies will increase runoff and improve quality. Improved biological and physical-chemical treatment technologies allow improvements in quality and reductions in cost and energy that will permit use and/or reuse of low quality water. Development of energy resources is important to the economy but impacts water resources. New technologies will reduce these impacts and decrease the costs. Simultaneous consideration of the social, economic, and cultural consequences of watersheds, treatment, and energy development is critical to permit community involvement in management decisions.

Broader Impacts:
This Center will focus on the recruitment, training, and graduation of underrepresented minority students. These activities will create a pipeline of new STEM professionals to address the water problems of the future. This Center will have beneficial impacts on a global scale by developing technologies and strategies for managing water in arid regions. It will produce regional benefits by increasing supplies through improved watershed management strategies. It will facilitate economic development of energy resources by minimizing water resource impacts. The research results will be disseminated broadly through a website, peer-reviewed technical literature, national conference presentations, and in venues and formats accessible to water professionals to improve water management decisions.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,"1700 Lomas Blvd. NE, Suite 2200",Albuquerque,US,Albuquerque,NM01,University of New Mexico,NM,871310001,47.076,"['Bruce M Thomson', 'Andrew  Schuler', 'Mark C Stone', 'Vanessa  Valentin']",03/07/2014,868853094,4967127,02/29/2020,4900,CENTERS FOR RSCH EXCELL IN S&T,5365576,1345169,784121725,Kerry  Howe,"1700 Lomas Blvd. NE, Suite 2200",Albuquerque,US,Albuquerque,NM01,University of New Mexico,NM,871310001,howe@unm.edu,Kerry,Howe,,5052772702,vsantiag@nsf.gov,Victor A.

90,"This research investigates why some adolescents are more likely to break rules than others by investigating the legal socialization process (i.e., how individuals develop their understanding of society's rules and make decisions to obey or break those rules).  Traditional models of legal socialization focus on individuals' ability to reason about moral and legal issues and their attitudes about the legal system.  The current project tests a new legal socialization model. Individuals who view authority figures that enforce rules in a fair manner are predicted to perceive the process as legitimate, to be less cynical about the rules, and to break fewer rules. Previous research testing this model has focused solely on the legal world (e.g., police officers and laws); the current research will include parents, teachers, and police as authority figures.  The study will use a sample of 500 adolescents currently participating in the New Hampshire Youth Study (NHYS), a seven year longitudinal study of the predictors of delinquency.  Participants will read scenarios describing situations in which an authority figure (i.e., parent, teacher, and police officer) behaves fairly or unfairly when enforcing a rule.  After each scenario, participants will rate how legitimate the authority is, their cynicism toward the rule, and the likelihood they would break the rule if they were in the situation.  

The findings will be used to develop an expanded model of legal socialization that integrates both traditional and new models of this process.  Ultimately, the proposed research will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the manner in which adolescents develop their understanding of rules and decide to break or obey rules; thereby providing a basis for developing interventions aimed at reducing rule breaking among adolescents.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF NEW HAMPSHIRE,51 COLLEGE RD SERVICE BLDG 107,Durham,US,Durham,NH01,University of New Hampshire,NH,038243585,47.075,['Rick  Trinkner'],07/07/2011,111089470,12862,06/30/2012,4900,LAW AND SOCIAL SCIENCES,12862,1122888,001765866,Ellen S Cohn,Conant Hall,Durham,US,Durham,NH01,University of New Hampshire,NH,038243520,ellen.cohn@unh.edu,Ellen,Cohn,S,6038623197,@nsf.gov,,,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"This project examined how individualsÆ interactions with authority figures influence their understanding of rules in society and how they make decisions to violate rules (i.e., legal socialization).  The study tested a new model of legal socialization which argues that when legal authorities enforce a rule fairly, adolescents are more likely to perceive those authorities as legitimate, be less cynical about their rules, and less likely to decide to engage in RVB.  This was the first study to examine this new model using experimental methodology, while also expanding the model to include non legal authorities (i.e., parents and teachers) as well as legal authorities (i.e., police officers). Adolescents and young adults were presented with a series of scenarios describing a situation in which an authority figure (i.e., parent, police officer, and teacher) enforced a rule either fairly or unfairly.  Either the authority did or did not give the person a chance to voice their opinions and did or did not enforce the rule in an impartial manner.  After reading the scenario, participants rated how legitimate they believed the authority to be, how cynical they were about the rule, and whether they believed the rule would be broken.  The results showed support for a model in which authority legitimacy and rule cynicism mediated the relation between fair treatment and the decision to engage in rule violating behavior.  Moreover, adolescents judged fair treatment differently depending on the authority in question.  For authorities for whom they had long-term contact (i.e., parents and teachers), they were more concerned with whether the authority treated them the same way the authority treated other members in the group.  However, for authorities for whom they had a single encounter or short-term contact, they were more concerned with whether the authority gave them a voice to explain their side.  These results provide a more comprehensive understanding of the manner in which legal socialization factors influence rule-violating behavior in adolescence by showing that interactions with authority figures (a relatively unexplored factor) are an important part of the legal socialization process.  In addition, they also emphasize that legal socialization, as well as rule-violation, are not based solely on adolescentsÆ experiences within the legal system, but also on their experiences in non legal situations and environments (e.g., the home and the school).

91,"A basic assumption of participatory democratic theory holds that civic engagement boosts an individual's political efficacy and increases future political participation. Though this empirical claim is important to political philosophy, public deliberation, civic engagement, and constitutional law, it has not been tested directly. To overcome the limitations of past research, this project tests the participation hypothesis in relation to the impact jury service has on electoral participation. The jury provides an ideal test because it is a non-voluntary, institutionalized form of public service to which a broad cross-section of the public is exposed. It is hypothesized that individuals who serve on juries and reach verdicts become more likely to vote and engage in other forms of civic activity than do those jurors who have inconclusive experiences. It is also predicted that this relationship is mediated by an increase in political efficacy and moderated by other aspects of the jury experience, including the nature of the trial, jury size, and decision rule. 

This project undertakes an in-depth examination of the experience of 2,000 jurors in a single jurisdiction. This test employs a panel survey design to test the hypothesized links in the theoretical model. Participants are interviewed at three points in time: when they enter the jury pool, shortly after they serve as jurors, then long after completing their service. This permits baseline measurement of demographics, attitudes and behaviors, self-report data on the experience of jury deliberation, short-term changes in political efficacy and other attitudes, and long-term changes in both efficacy and political behaviors beyond electoral participation. In designing this survey, as well as other activities, the project is assisted by an advisory panel consisting of preeminent jury researchers and civic engagement scholars. 

The most far-reaching potential impact of this research is on the degree to which underrepresented groups are included in the legal and political process. Unequal representation in juries may be among the underlying causes of unequal registration and turnout across different social groups, and the study could highlight the importance of enacting legal reforms to make the jury pool and seated juries more representative. By revealing the civic impact of jury service, research could also strengthen the case for maintaining the vitality of the jury as a basic public institution.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,4333 Brooklyn Ave NE,Seattle,US,Seattle,WA07,University of Washington,WA,981950001,47.075,"['Philip J Weiser', 'Eugene P Deess']",07/23/2003,605799469,176494,07/31/2005,4900,LAW AND SOCIAL SCIENCES,176494,0318513,042803536,John W Gastil,4333 Brooklyn Ave NE,Seattle,US,Seattle,WA07,University of Washington,WA,981950001,jgastil@psu.edu,John,Gastil,W,8148655232,@nsf.gov,,,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,,08/01/2003,Jury Deliberation and Civic Engagement,Grant
92,"This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support project examines how voters learn about the candidates and issues in presidential nomination campaigns. Presidential nomination campaigns are difficult environments for voters, except for the in party when a sitting president is seeking reelection. This is true because it nearly always begins as a low information race and the contextual environment that faces citizens is a difficult one because of the intraparty nature of the contest and the multiple numbers of candidates competing. However, because the race is sequential and lasts over a period of months, voters have a tremendous opportunity to learn about the candidates through the events and activities of candidates, reports by the media, and the decisions of primary voters and caucus goers. While technically each state campaign is a state contest for the sole purpose of delegate selection, the state campaigns have been nationalized making state events opportunities for candidates to earn national and local media coverage, create a voter support base across states and raise needed campaign funds. As candidates become more known through their activities, media reports and election outcomes individual level attitudes and preferences change. While information may vary across states, based upon the level of campaign action in the state, and between interested and uninterested individuals, information does accrue and does impact both preferences and attitudes about the candidates. Information, therefore, about winners and losers and more substantive information about candidates' traits and policies, helps future voters determine the viability and electability of candidates, weeding out candidates who are the weakest alternatives.
In this research the Ph. D. student focuses on how potential nomination voters respond to the campaign as it unfolds, considering the contextual environment that voters find themselves in (hard fought or low key sate contests) and the attributes of individuals, especially their level of political sophistication, that makes potential voters more or less likely to receive and accept new political information.   The key questions center around how information matters to voters and when and which voters acquire and react to information. Information comes from the intensity of the campaign at the state and national level. For this dissertation the student focuses on three key dependent variables: knowledge about the candidates, candidate choice or candidate preference and political engagement.  To address questions related to voter learning the research design consists of a rolling panel and cross-sectional survey design that captures attitude development as it changes in response to the context of the campaign. In addition, the research program collects a vast amount of contextual data on candidate behavior, media coverage and macro campaign conditions. The design and data collection allows the student to connect the activities of candidates, the media and macro campaign conditions with individuals and interact that information with individual level measures of political sophistication. By examining the contextual environment she will be able to assess what, when and which voters learn about the candidates and how that knowledge assists them in making more informed decisions. 
The project has the potential for broader impact because it will assist in graduate and undergraduate training and provide a resource for future studies of presidential nomination campaigns, the importance of voter context and the value of contextual data in understanding individual level attitudes and behavior.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,"1700 Lomas Blvd. NE, Suite 2200",Albuquerque,US,Albuquerque,NM01,University of New Mexico,NM,871310001,47.075,,06/03/2003,868853094,12000,08/31/2004,4900,POLITICAL SCIENCE,12000,0321438,784121725,Lonna Rae  Atkeson,"1700 Lomas Blvd. NE, Suite 2200",Albuquerque,US,Albuquerque,NM01,University of New Mexico,NM,871310001,atkeson@unm.edu,Lonna Rae,Atkeson,,5056608976,@nsf.gov,,,490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,,,,06/01/2003,Doctoral Dissertation Research in Political Science: The Impact of Community Organizing on Political Engagement,Grant

The PIs propose to use airborne geophysics to provide detailed geophysical mapping over the Marie Byrd Land dome of West Antarctica. They will use a Basler equipped with advanced ice penetrating radar, a magnetometer, an airborne gravimeter and laser altimeter. They will test models of Marie Byrd Land lithospheric evolution in three ways: 1) constrain bedrock topography and crustal structure of central Marie Byrd Land for the first time; 2) map subglacial geomorphology of Marie Byrd Land to constrain landscape evolution; and 3) map the distribution of subglacial volcanic centers and identify active sources. Marie Byrd Land is one of the few parts of West Antarctica whose bedrock lies above sea level; as such, it has a key role to play in the formation and decay of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), and thus on eustatic sea level change during the Neogene. Several lines of evidence suggest that the topography of Marie Byrd Land has changed over the course of the Cenozoic, with significant implications for the origin and evolution of the ice sheet.

It is a critical region in that it is one of the few parts of West Antarctica where the underside of the overlying ice sheet lies above sea level, and thus is stable, while much of the rest of West Antarctica Ice Sheet is susceptible to collapse.  The remnant ice cap on MBL is likely where the West Antarctic Ice Sheet grows back from when the rest collapses during warm periods.  However, volcanoes in MBL and some exposed, eroded outcrops indicate that the bedrock of MBL might have changed elevation over geological time.

The Geophysical Investigation of Marie Byrd Land Evolution (GIMBLE) project completed two expeditions across the coastal Marie Byrd Land sector of West Antarctica in 2013 and 2014.  We used an ski equipped DC-3T Basler aircraft to survey from two USAP field camps in the interior of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.  The aircraft carried an advanced ice penetrating radar to examine the ice layers and the underside of the ice sheet, a magnetometer to indicate the composition and structure of underlying rocks, and a three-axis stabilized gravimeter to measure the density and crustal structure of the underlying crust. 

Intellectual merit: The first season was based out of Byrd Field Camp, and in part resurveyed sites that had been measured using POLENET seismometers which give an independent measurement of crustal structure.  A major finding was confirming the site of a recent subglacial volcano over a site of ongoing deep earthquakes on the southern edge of the MBL highlands.  This was consistent with high localized geothermal heat flow in MBL, consistent with POLENETs identification of a possible mantle hotspot under MBL from seismic data.  Geothermal heat flow is significant for ice sheet evolution in that it melts the underside of the ice sheet, providing water and lubrication to ice flow. Between field seasons GIMBLE assisted with working up radar data over nearby Thwaites Glacier which identified regions of high basal melting of the ice sheet and again indicated high localized geothermal heat flow in this region.

The second season of GIMBLE operated out of WAIS Divide field camp and created a high resolution grid of the interior of the MBL.  We found that the character of the buried landscape changes abruptly between the ocean edge of the MBL and the interior between the volcanoes.  We interpret both landscapes as predating the current ice sheet.  The coastal region consists of an ancient planed-off surface that broke and rotated as MBL was stretched by tectonic forces well before ice came to West Antarctica.  The interior records the inception of ice driven erosion, with rough mountain peaks surrounded by very deep glacial valleys that appear to be associated with major volcanoes.

We also found evidence for a major water sheet under the ice near the MBL highland, at the point where a two major Antarctic Ice streams start.  Again, this is likely evidence for local enhanced melting by geothermal heat flow.

Broader Impacts: GIMBLE has had the opportunity to work with a range of graduate students, undergraduates and high school students, in planning the survey design, participating in the field work, and analyzing the data.  Data is also in the process of being released.

94,"How natural are the forests of Amazonia? A growing case is being made among anthropologists and archaeologists that prior to European contact in 1492, native people manipulated much, perhaps most, of Amazonia. If fire was used across the Amazon basin to clear land for agriculture then forest ecosystems that ecologists have assumed were mature may in fact be only one to several generations removed from intensive management.  Given that Amazonia is the largest rainforest and home to unparalleled biodiversity, understanding the extent to which wildlife and people have interacted in the past is vital for effective planning and management. A further aspect of this debate is that if much of Amazonia is truly the product of disturbance, the forest must be considered to be relatively young and is probably not at equilibrium with respect to carbon cycling.

	To test the hypothesis of widespread disturbance, this project will conduct the first systematic survey of Amazonian soils for charcoal. Fires in Amazonia are almost always human-induced, and each burn leaves ash and charcoal that become incorporated into soil. Over 300 soil pits will be sampled on transects across Amazonia, to determine the distribution and age of buried charcoal. Prior soil descriptions also will be used to determine where other scientists have located charcoal and compare data gathered in this project with a new model for pre-Columbian settlement of Amazonia. Through these analyses, the collaborating team from Florida Tech, Wake Forest, University of Florida, The National History Museum, and Guarulhos University, Brazil, will hope to inject real data into the policy arena of Amazonian development and conservation.",NSF,4900,"FLORIDA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, INC.",150 W UNIVERSITY BLVD,MELBOURNE,US,Melbourne,FL08,Florida Institute of Technology,FL,329016975,47.074,['Dolores R Piperno'],03/27/2008,053396669,410995,12/31/2012,4900,POP & COMMUNITY ECOL CLUSTER,452991,0742301,053396669,Mark B Bush,150 W UNIVERSITY BLVD,MELBOURNE,US,Melbourne,FL08,Florida Institute of Technology,FL,329016975,mbush@fit.edu,Mark,Bush,B,3216747166,atessier@nsf.gov,Alan James Tessier,7032927198,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Project Title: Collaborative Research: Pre-Columbian Human Impacts on Amazonian ecosystems

What did the Amazon rainforest look like when the first Europeans arrived in 1541A.D.? For decades, it was thought that Amazonia was so resource-poor that the native inhabitants were unable to develop complex societies as they did in other parts of the Andes or Central  America. But recent archaeological discoveries suggest otherwise. Earthworks and enriched soils, termed terra pretas, have been discovered in a few areas, leading many researchers to suggest that most of Amazonia was a transformed landscape. The overall population density and distribution of native inhabitants of Amazonia is now fiercely debated. The research project ""Pre-Columbian Human Impacts on Amazonian ecosystems"" addressed this debate.

 

This project was the first landscape-scale analysis of pre-Columbian impacts in Amazonia, with ~ 400 soil cores collected over stratified-randomized survey design in a 3 x106 km2 section of central and western Amazonia. Phytoliths, which are silica bodies deposited in soils when many plant species decay, were analyzed to provide vegetation histories from the sampled sites. Charcoal was used to reconstruct fire histories at those locations, many fragments were dated to confirm that the fires were from the pre-Columbian era. As fire is not natural in Amazonia, the fire histories were indicative of anthropogenic forest burning.

 

None of the sampled sites contained artifacts or terra preta soils, indicating that the sampled regions did not contain landscape-scale forest clearing and large societies. However, low-impact human activity was found in most regions, and these activities were spatially patterned according to environmental features. Fire and disturbance-indicating plant taxa were most frequently found near major rivers and areas far-removed from rivers contained a much lighter disturbance signature. The ever-wet western forests also had a much lighter disturbance signature than the central forests, which are drier and easier to burn. Even in areas with known maize agriculture, human impacts were localized and heterogeneous. We did not find evidence that the ~180,000 km2 of bamboo-dominated forests in western Amazonia resulted from pre-Columbian societies, as had been previously suggested. Our projects results indicated that before European arrival, Amazonia was not a completely transformed landscape, and in western Amazonia pre-Columbian impacts ranged in degree but may be predictable in space.

 

But why should anyone care? Assuming that intensive and extensive pre-Columbian disturbances occurred throughout Amazonia was becoming the norm, and generated an array of hypotheses. If Amazonian forests were mostly deforested only 500 years ago, does that mean the forests are resilient to disturbance?  Was the ultra-diverse Amazonian plant and animal diversity structured by ancient people? Did the pre-Columbian population collapse in Amazonia result in a massive forest re-growth that decreased global CO2 levels? Our results suggested that conclusions based on assumptions of a pre-Columbian parkland need reassessing.

95,"Strategic communicators are increasingly interested in ways to galvanize the public and policymakers to take action to offset clear threats to human and planetary health. To motivate civic engagement with health and environmental issues, communicators would benefit from exploring messaging strategies that go beyond informational portrayals of an issue to engage audiences on an emotional level. To this end, this research explores the viability of persuasive anger appeals. According to persuasion theory, anger-arousing messages must not only evoke anger in order to change attitudes and behaviors; they must also instill beliefs about the efficacy of taking action. The theory, however,  has been imprecise about what those efficacy beliefs entail. Because anger tends to motivate a desire to retaliate against a perceived wrongdoer, it follows that anger may have the strongest effects on persuasive outcomes when the audience believes that a particular action will punish the wrongdoer, a new concept the researchers call retributive efficacy. As such, we expect an anger appeal to be most effective when it evokes anger toward culprits of these harms and then communicates how a recommended response will effectively punish the offender. 

In examining persuasive anger appeals, the researchers use two issues for which there is scientific consensus about the magnitude of the problem and the need for collective solutions. Three studies examine how to design messages that harness anger about perceived  injustices (referred to as moral anger) and how to translate that emotion into activism. Study 1 uses a cross-sectional survey design to validate a proposed measure of retributive efficacy. Studies 2 and 3 build on the first study by experimentally testing messages that instill moral anger and retributive efficacy. Additionally, study 3 explores the extent to which evoked anger temporally evolves during exposure to such messages -- a phenomenon called emotional flow. Study findings offer risk communicators direct, theory-informed guidance on how to craft maximally effective persuasive appeals to anger. The research also contribute to our theoretical understanding of anger appeals, which have received far less scholarly attention than appeals to other emotions like fear or humor.

98,"Local hazard preparedness is vital to avoid disaster in the face of extreme events. Whereas conventional risk communication relies on scientific information to affect hazard preparedness, such technical information is often ineffectively assimilated into people's risk perceptions and decisions. Hazard preparedness is largely shaped by factors such as cultural values, cognitive biases, affect, knowledge, information, and experiences, all of which are communicated through stories that people construct and recount to one another. This research will test the effects of an innovative narrative-based risk communication strategy that locates science hazard information in locally produced hazard narratives. Effectively connecting scientific information to individual risk perceptions and decisions through co-produced risk narratives potentially offers an innovative way to improve hazard preparedness that could translate across hazard issues more broadly. With the project focus on flooding events, this research will draw upon expertise in social behavioral sciences, hydrology, and computer science. 
   
This interdisciplinary research effort focuses on testing whether a co-produced, narrative-based risk communication approach is more effective than conventional risk communication at improving hazard preparedness (defined as risk perception and decisions). The first objective is to develop co-produced risk narratives that are both scientifically accurate and locally relevant. Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, baseline data of flood risk narratives will be collected from river communities to ascertain narrative elements as identified in the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF). Narrative elements include subsets of narrative structure (e.g., use of characters, plot) and narrative content (who is cast in the roles of hero, villain, victim). Whereas narrative structures are stable, content varies across narratives. The characters cast in the narrative and their associated actions are formative in constructing different notions of reality and consequent decisions. Natural Language Processing computational techniques will then be used to identify key narrative content from the CBPR data to obtain the best set of combinations of narrative structure and narrative content situated in local language and images. Subsequently, researchers will quantify, explain, and depict sources of hydrologic uncertainty (data, model, and natural uncertainty) associated with flood frequency analysis in 100-year flood maps for each community. This resulting information will be embedded into the algorithmically enhanced CBPR-based risk narratives to create locally relevant and scientifically accurate flood risk narratives. These risk narratives will be returned to the CBPR groups for adjustment and validation. The second objective focuses on testing the effects of these co-produced risk narratives as narrative treatments on hazard preparedness (i.e., risk perception and intended decisions) with an experimental survey design across the larger population in these river communities. Differently constructed co-produced narratives (i.e., hero-focused, victim-focused, hero & victim focused narratives) will be used as treatments to test the extent to which they influence hazard preparedness in contrast to a non-narrative science statement and a control condition of no treatment. The findings are expected to provide insight into the power of narratives in communicating hazard risk and affecting hazard preparedness.

99,"Intellectual Merit: 
The PIs propose to analyze a transect of 57 high-quality magnetotelluric (MT) soundings acquired over two Antarctic field seasons to examine competing hypotheses for the mechanism of extension and creation of the Transantarctic Mountains. These data will also be used to characterize the thermal regimes of rifted West Antarctica and stable East Antarctica. In the MT method, temporal variations in the Earth's natural electromagnetic field are used as source fields to probe the electrical resistivity structure in the depth range of 1 to 200 km below Earth's surface. Raw MT soundings contain significant information related to the thermal regime beneath the Transantarctic Mountains as it relates to support mechanisms and composition. This information will enable comparison to other rift-platform transitions, such as in the western United States. The distinct character of the MT data will also be correlated with regional aeromagnetic trends and tied to outcrops in terms of distinct lithologies such as meta-sedimentary terranes and plutonic complexes. Specifically, the goals of this research are: to establish the location of the tectonic transition between East and West Antarctica, which may help infer a support mechanism for the Transantarctic Mountains; to use MT data to estimate crustal heat flux into the ice sheet base; and to determine if regional-scale resistivity properties be used as a proxy for lithological discrimination, to support facies extrapolation and terrane reconstruction.

A 550 km-long transect of magnetotelluric geophysical soundings spanning the central Transantarctic Mountains shows that high electrical resistivities persist to at least 150 km depth across the range, implying a cold stable state well into the upper mantle. Thus, thermal encroachment by West Antarctic extension is not a significant cause of uplift here. A flexural cantilever model of deformation, perhaps aided by lateral compositional contrasts, appears to be a more applicable uplift mechanism for the central Transantarctic Mountains. East-central West Antarctica exhibits a low resistivity, modestly hydrated asthenosphere and concentrated extension (rift necking) near the Transantarctic Mountains range front. Broader scale heat flow of east-central West Antarctica in our study appears moderate, on the order of 60-70 mWm-2, lower than that of the U.S. Great  Basin. Conductive, sutured Precambrian meta-sediments are interpreted to lie northeastward toward the polar plateau. This project supported the training of a highly capable post-doctoral researcher in EM geophysical inversion. This project confirms the viability of achieving high-fidelity MT recordings over polar ice sheets through the interfacing of custom electronic components for measuring the E-field with commercial MT instrumentation.

Our research results and papers presented at the American Society for Engineering Education Annual meetings in 2014 and 2015 were discussed with experts from across the United States.

Three sets of online exercises to support mechanics learning were created and integrated with both hardware for in-class exercises and written homework assignments.  All of these materials could be made available to other educators. The online exercises support student learning on the topics of equilibrium analysis, creating free-body diagrams, and drawing shear and bending moment diagrams (see Figure 1 for example questions).  Each set of exercises includes 1-2 instructional videos each followed by a set of questions that are graded. If students get an answer wrong (and if they get it right) they have an opportunity to review the correct answer and explanations. Each of the three exercises takes students between 25-40 minutes to complete.  We have seen in increase in understanding through the implementation of these exercises and have identified interesting trends for confidence increases relative to gender and level of education of parents.  Currently these materials are used by two instructors of the Introduction to Solid Mechanics course at Stanford.

Students found the supplemental online exercises useful and wanted to use them again later in the quarter for reviewing concepts. As might be expected, student performance on the online exercises was higher when the concept had been covered in class prior to the online assignment, as compared with online assignments where new material was taught in an online video prior to completing the exercises.

We continue to collect data and have found that student exam performance is impacted by performance on online exercises, performance on written homework, average confidence across the quarter and gender. In-class participation (as measured by completion of in-class worksheets for team exercises and labs) did not significantly affect exam scores.  Across the quarters, all students saw an increase in statics self-efficacy when comparing the end of the quarter to the start of the quarter. Both women and first generation (college-educated) students started with higher statics self-efficacy than men and non-first generation students, respectively. In addition, both women and first generation (college-educated) students saw lesser gains in their statics self-efficacy than did men and non-first generation students, respectively ending the quarter with slightly lower self-efficacy than the male and non-first generation college-educated students. We hypothesize that group work throughout the quarter where women and first-generation students may have been the minority in their groups might have contributed to their lesser gains and will explore this observation in the near term.

Through this project, three professors with expertise ranging from cognitive psychology and survey design and analysis to mixed-methods research and teaching in engineering education collaborated and mentored a diverse set of students, researchers and educators.  This project was the first engineering education research project for the PI and from this experience research and assessment has been embedded in additional classes that she teaches.

102,"Although public interest in genes and genotyping is increasing, much of the public discourse on genetics centers on the simplistic notion that there is a single, identifiable gene that can be directly linked to specific psychological or behavioral tendencies (e.g. ?The Shyness Gene?). This simplistic understanding of the role of genes can be particularly problematic when it is associated with group differences, such as cultural and racial differences, as such a view can lead to thinking that many observed psychological and behavioral differences are innate and fixed. The influence of genes on the shaping of everyday behaviors is far from simple and how social and cultural factors impact the behavioral expression of genes is still largely unknown. The present research examines how culture might influence the way in which particular genes lead to specific patterns of behaviors. Previous research has found that there are large differences in how people rely on social support to cope with their stress. That is, European Americans tend to seek social support more explicitly and directly than Asians/Asian Americans, who prefer more indirect and implicit social support. Previous research has also found that particular genes (e.g., serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism) can influence psychological predispositions (e.g., how strongly a person reacts to stress). Building on these findings, this research examines whether people with the same genetic predisposition actually behave in largely different manners, if they are exposed to different cultural norms and expectations. The research will thus investigate whether and how culture might diversify the psychological and behavioral expression of genes. More specifically, the present research will examine: 1) how specific genes are linked to psychological proneness to stress reactivity and social affiliation; 2) how culture interacts with these specific genes to produce the culturally divergent ways in which people use social support; and 3) how the culturally specific patterns of social support behavior of Asians change as they acculturate to the U.S. The studies will combine genetic analysis with multiple psychological methods, such as large survey design, lab experiment, and daily diary. 

Bridging the fields of psychology, biology, and anthropology, this program of research aims to create a new interdisciplinary theoretical framework for understanding cross-cultural and cross-ethnic behavioral variation.

103,"Although public interest in genes and genotyping is increasing, much of the public discourse on genetics centers on the simplistic notion that there is a clear gene that can be directly linked to specific psychological or behavioral tendencies (e.g. ?The Shyness Gene?). This simplistic understanding of the role of genes can be particularly problematic when it is associated with group differences, such as cultural and racial differences, as such a view can lead to thinking that many observed psychological and behavioral differences are innate and fixed. The influence of genes on the shaping of everyday behaviors is far from simple and how social and cultural factors impact the behavioral expression of genes is still largely unknown. The present research examines how culture might influence the way in which particular genes lead to specific patterns of behaviors. Previous research has found that there are large differences in how people rely on social support to cope with their stress. That is, European Americans tend to seek social support more explicitly and directly than Asians/Asian Americans, who prefer more indirect and implicit social support. Previous research has also found that particular genes (e.g., serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism) can influence psychological predispositions (e.g., how strongly a person reacts to stress). Building on these findings, this research examines whether people with the same genetic predisposition actually behave in largely different manners, if they are exposed to different cultural norms and expectations. The research will thus investigate whether and how culture might diversify the psychological and behavioral expression of genes. More specifically, the present research will examine: 1) how specific genes are linked to psychological proneness to stress reactivity and social affiliation; 2) how culture interacts with these specific genes to produce the culturally divergent ways in which people use social support; and 3) how the culturally specific patterns of social support behavior of Asians change as they acculturate to the U.S. The studies will combine genetic analysis with multiple psychological methods, such as large survey design, lab experiment, and daily diary. 

Bridging the fields of psychology, biology, and anthropology, this program of research aims to create a new interdisciplinary theoretical framework for understanding cross-cultural and cross-ethnic behavioral variation. This program of research, an international collaboration between researchers in the United States and the Republic of Korea, will also foster opportunities for researchers and students to be exposed to and trained in theoretical and technical approaches in the different disciplines. Finally, this program of research will contribute to a scientific pool of knowledge that can be utilized in educating the public regarding the role of genes in the determination of human behaviors and promoting a more sophisticated understanding of group differences.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SANTA BARBARA",Office of Research,Santa Barbara,US,Santa Barbara,CA24,University of California-Santa Barbara,CA,931062050,47.075,"['Shelley E Taylor', 'David  Sherman']",01/22/2008,094878394,586697,01/31/2012,4900,HSD - DYNAMICS OF HUMAN BEHAVI,599952,0729532,071549000,Heejung  Kim,Office of Research,Santa Barbara,US,Santa Barbara,CA24,University of California-Santa Barbara,CA,931062050,heejung.kim@psych.ucsb.edu,Heejung,Kim,,8058936180,@nsf.gov,,,040100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"Intellectual Merit: With support from NSF Human and Social Dynamics, an international team of psychologists and geneticists collected psychological and genetic data from samples of South Koreans and North Americans. This research found that genes that relate to the serotonin system and the oxytocin system can produce very different cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal behaviors depending on the cultural experiences of people. For instance, people who carry an emotional sensitivity variant of oxytocin receptor gene behave in ways that are more culturally normative than people who do not carry the variant. The findings help dispel a simplistic understanding of the role of genes that can be extremely problematic when it is associated with cultural and racial group differences. By demonstrating how the same genetic predisposition can lead to different behavioral patterns as a result of different cultural experiences and social interactions, this approach illustrates both the impact and limitations of genetic analyses and provides further scientific evidence of the process by which genes influence human behavior.

Broader Impact: As increasing attention is paid to genetic contributions to behavior, these findings highlight the importance of recognizing culture as a form of social environment that interacts with genes to shape human behavior. The old saying that people are products of both nurture and nature is undoubtedly true, and this research offers a new way of thinking about how factors of nature and nurture interact.

104,"Intellectual Merit of Research. - The Marlborough strike slip fault system of New Zealand clearly exemplifies the transition in plate convergence from near decoupling between upper and lower plates in true subduction (northern North Island), to essentially complete coupling between the plates with near-continuous thickening of the crust and upper mantle and no subduction (central South Island). In Marlborough, four major dextral fault zones at a low angle to the present Australian-Pacific plate convergence direction accommodate most of the component of motion parallel to the plate boundary. A magnetotelluric (MT) geophysical transect of the region is to be carried out to clarify controls on internal physical state of strike slip fault zones, and fill a gap in understanding of transpressional orogens between uncoupled and fully coupled situations. Basic questions to be addressed include: 1) How much are seismogenic faults fluidized, which may influence stress buildup?, 2) Is the fluid state of fault zones a function of cumulative displacement or degree of activity?, 3) Do major fault zones acquire their fluids locally, or from the lower crust?, 4) What are the physical conditions in the crust as major strike slip faults initiate?, 5) What enables coupling between subducting and overriding plates to develop?, 6) Is the subduction interface sharp, or is there a broad zone of diffuse deformation?, 7) If fluids help control rheology near the subduction interface, what is their origin?, and 8) Do slab dehydration reactions contribute to seismicity of the downgoing slab?
Broader Impacts of the Research. - The proposal is a fully cooperative effort between the University of Utah of the United States and the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences (IGNS) of New Zealand in research into an important solid earth problem. Support for a female graduate student is made available for education into state of the art geophysical instrumentation, parameters of field survey design, practical logistical matters in overseas settings, modern methods of inversion, and the relationship between electrical resistivity and physico-chemical state in the Earth. The utility of off-the-shelf commercial geophysical instrumentation for specialized solid earth studies is tested and the project raises the profile of electrical methods, an underutilized field, in solid earth science.
